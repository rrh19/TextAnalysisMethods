142000,217341,François Hollande won’t seek another term as France’s president,Washington Post,James McAuley,2016-12-01,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161202005801/https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/francois-hollande-wont-seek-another-term-as-frances-president/2016/12/01/a36d452c-b7fb-11e6-939c-91749443c5e5_story.html
","  PARIS  —   François Hollande, France’s unpopular Socialist president, announced Thursday night that he would not seek reelection in 2017. “I’ve decided not to be a candidate to renew my mandate,” he said on French television. The announcement was unusual, as Hollande is a sitting president who is nearing the end of the first of two possible terms in office. But after consistently high unemployment figures and a string of terrorist attacks that killed more than 230 people in the last two years, he became the most unpopular president in the history of modern France.  A recent poll conducted by Le Monde newspaper placed Hollande’s approval rating at 4 percent. Hollande’s decision opens the field for a leftist candidate to square off against François Fillon, who won both rounds of France’s conservative primaries last week, and Marine Le Pen, the outspoken leader of France’s   National Front party who has been steadily rising in the polls. Had Hollande stayed in the race, analysts predicted that the spring 2017 general election would have been largely a contest between the   and the far right. But now there will be room for a leftist candidate without Hollande’s low approval ratings to fight for the presidency. France’s leftist primaries will be conducted in January, but Manuel Valls, Hollande’s current prime minister, is already the favorite. Valls has said he is “ready” to compete in the election, although he has not formally announced his candidacy. Emmanuel Macron, Hollande’s former economy minister, has announced he will run in 2017 as an independent candidate. Despite his unpopularity, Hollande said in his speech that he had “only one regret  —   having proposed the ‘loss of nationality.’ ” The provision, proposed in response to the November 2015 terrorist attacks in Paris that killed 130 people, would have stripped French citizenship from convicted terrorists who held dual nationality. Ultimately abandoned, the proposed nationality law alienated much of the French left, which argued that it would have enshrined in the French constitution differences among citizens. Some analysts see Hollande’s decision as a rapprochement with his own party, already in shambles before an election in which it will compete against strong   candidates less than a year after Donald Trump was elected U. S. president and Britain voted to leave the European Union. “He wants to end his term reconciled with the left,” said Patrick Weil, France’s preeminent historian of nationality and immigration. “He won’t run because it would divide it  —   he knows he hurt the left profoundly. ” France’s presidential election will take place in April and May 2017.

142001,217342,I know what it’s like to care for a son with microcephaly. My child is 53 years old.,Washington Post,Barbara Altman,2016-11-28,2016.0,11.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161202005801/https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/i-know-what-its-like-to-care-for-a-son-with-microcephaly-my-child-is-53-years-old/2016/11/22/27ad1340-9938-11e6-a0ed-ab0774c1eaa5_story.html
","       We have heard many reports in the past year about the spread of the Zika virus and the extreme brain damage it can cause to unborn children, but it can be difficult to understand what that means for families. As a woman who has mothered such a child for the past 53 years, let me share some of the difficulties as well as the joys of parenting a child with microcephaly. In my son’s case, microcephaly was caused by unknown factors in the first trimester of pregnancy. Andy cannot speak, and although we have tried many times, he cannot use any communication devices. He did not walk until he was 10. He has never learned to read or write or to do any math, he has never held a job and he needs   supervision to keep him safe.  He knows his name, and he recognizes his home, siblings, parents, friends and staff members at his group home and his day program. He is cooperative with dressing and bathing, feeds himself and is toilet trained.  He is an extremely happy person and he makes a lot of happy noises, even laughing out loud, infectiously at times. He likes music, toys that make noise, therapeutic riding and going anywhere in a car. He definitely likes to hold hands and is a great hugger. He never has an angry day, and his pleasant personality can light up a room. While he doesn’t make the usual contributions to society through employment, marriage or volunteering, I consider his presence a gift. Not all people with microcephaly are as impaired as he, but I am speaking from my own experience.    Barbara prepares Andrew, who has microcephaly, for lunch. Altman doesn’t know what caused her son’s condition. (Jabin   Washington Post)  At his birth in 1963, the expectations for children such as Andy were very different from today. Those with intellectual and developmental disabilities were warehoused in institutions, usually in rural areas, out of sight and out of mind.  Andy was my third child. At age 2 months, my husband and I took him to Philadelphia Children’s Hospital  —   we were living in Harrisburg  —   at the urging of our pediatrician, who was concerned about his head size. A doctor at the hospital identified his condition as microcephaly and predicted that he would never walk or talk. Because I had two older children, he advised institutionalization for Andy and said we should do it quickly, before we got too attached. It is impossible to communicate our shock at such a plan. We were already attached and rejected the idea immediately. Fortunately, John F. Kennedy was president, and his sister Rosemary’s mental retardation (to use the terminology of the time) led him to several breakthrough policies. After his inauguration, Kennedy created a panel of scientists, doctors and others to develop a plan of action.   In a message to Congress in 1963, using the panel’s report as a blueprint, he outlined a new approach to intellectual disabilities. It included programs for maternity care, initiatives to move away from custodial institutions and plans for research centers. Congress passed legislation enacting many of these ideas before the year was out. However it was the emphasis on special education, training and rehabilitation proposed in the report that helped us keep our son at home.  It took another 12 years for the Education for All Handicapped Children Act to establish the right to a public education for children with disabilities. During the period before public facilities were available, some private programs provided at least   training for children with disabilities in their communities.     Andrew watches television as his mother prepares a meal. Barbara wants other parents to know the joys of parenting a disabled child. (Jabin   Washington Post)  Because I was a    mom, I took care of the kids as usual. But things became harder the longer Andy didn’t walk.  Although he was small at age 10  —   he weighed only 55 pounds  —   he was about 3½ feet tall. It was hard to pick him up, and he was too big for a stroller. He became good at scooting on his bottom from room to room. The most difficult part was getting him upstairs to go to bed. He was not toilet trained then  —   still in diapers before disposable diapers.  Because he had not walked at the normal age, his hip joints didn’t function properly and doctors recommended surgery. We were by then living in Maryland and able to proceed with that idea in 1974 because of a new type of institution, funded by Medicaid, which had opened in 1970. The original purpose of Great Oaks, in Prince George’s County, was to provide short institutional stays for therapy or training and return children like Andy to the community. The surgery took place, followed by recovery in leg casts for two months at home, then residence at Great Oaks for therapy for six months. The outcome was notable: He walked!  Andy’s time in Great Oaks also allowed me to go to graduate school. My older children were in high school and had adjusted pretty well to having such an impaired brother. Following his surgery, Andy attended a private day program in the District. Being able to walk meant it was easier for a babysitter to care for him after school. So I continued my studies and eventually got a job. Andy started public school in 1979, at age 16, four years after passage of the legislation giving him that right. He was admitted to Longview, one of the first schools in Montgomery County with a day program for special education. By that time, both of my older sons were in college and I worked full time to help defray their educational and other expenses.  And then we came upon the abyss. In 1984, at age 21, Andy was no longer eligible for public education, and there were no further public programs for someone with his level of impairment. I didn’t want to give up my job, and we were fortunate to find a daily caregiver. We hoped that new programs would be developed because the climate was changing for many with intellectual disabilities. To settle a landmark lawsuit involving abuse and neglect of children and adults in 1984, Pennsylvania officials had agreed to close the Pennhurst State School and Hospital, which was completed by 1987.  This started closures of state institutions around the country. We thought it was just a matter of time before programs would be developed for this population.    Andrew lives in a group home but his parents pick him up almost every weekend. He comes home Saturday and returns Sunday. (Jabin   Washington Post)  In 1988, I needed a hip replacement, so we enlisted Great Oaks to care for Andy again for a few months while I recovered. There were few if any group homes available, and we thought there would be no harm in a short stay. Unfortunately, Great Oaks’ original rehabilitation goals had gone by the wayside, replaced by the old institutional model. By that time, Maryland was closing its institutions, and residents of such places as Great Oaks were being given the first chance at the limited placements in group homes. Andy would be transferred to a group home and an accompanying day program when and if he was selected. We concluded that getting into such a program was worth keeping him institutionalized a little longer, so he remained there after I recovered.  While he was in Great Oaks, I would pick him up on Friday evenings as I came home from work. However, my happy boy cried every time he went back, so my husband was elected to take him back on Sundays. Six months stretched into a year. (The “talkers” and the “ ” residents of Great Oaks were the first to leave the institution.) Finally in 1989, at age 26, Andy was offered a   placement with the Arc Montgomery County, a nonprofit parents’ organization that we had joined soon after Andy’s birth.   Since then, he has lived close by in the Rockville area, currently with four other men of varying abilities. He has lived with one of his roommates for the full 27 years he has been in a group home. We still pick him up almost every weekend, but, in deference to our age (I am 80, my husband is 83) he comes home Saturday and goes back Sunday. I make sure he toilets regularly, and I grind his food (he has developed a swallowing problem) but otherwise he entertains himself, plays with his toys, walks around the house, watches TV or takes walks with us. He is as happy to go back to his group home as he is to come to our house. As he ages, there are other health and welfare decisions to be made periodically, but for the moment he is in a very good place. One particularly gratifying event was his attendance at our 50th anniversary party 10 years ago. He had not seen extended family for many years, and I was uncertain how they would react to him. He came with his favorite staff person from his group home. He was greeted warmly by all and he seemed to enjoy every minute of the attention. He particularly liked listening to the band.    Andrew swings on a bench with his mother. (Jabin   Washington Post)   It was good to have him participate in a family celebration, something he wasn’t always able to do as he was growing up because of the logistics (and attitudes) of the different circumstances, which meant he wasn’t always accepted. While the great majority of people with disabilities can be independent, work, get around (with accessible transportation) and enjoy social activities, those who need assistance with   or supervision for safety make up only about 4 percent of the country’s adult population. About 52 percent are older than 65.   A very small subgroup, which includes Andy, are without the cognitive capacity to direct their lives. We have moved many people with these serious limitations out of institutions, but we haven’t necessarily improved all of their lives. Sheltered workshops, which provided stimulating activities for Andy for years, are now being closed. This closing is best for most clients, but for some, like Andy, it means being relegated to day programs mostly populated by the elderly or, if there is no day program available, being placed in a nursing home. While I live, I won’t let that happen.  We have come a long way in treatment of those with disabilities in the 53 years of Andy’s life, but with the Zika virus, the number of people with   limitations will be increasing at the earliest ages. It is time to reexamine what President Kennedy started and commit the necessary resources to helping  —   and including  —   everyone with limitations. They have a wide range of needs that don’t stop when they turn 21.  Altman, a sociologist, is retired from the National Center for Health Statistics, where she serves as a consultant on   issues.       "
142002,217343,Princess Cruises to pay record-breaking criminal fine for ocean pollution,Washington Post,Brady Dennis,2016-12-01,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161202005801/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2016/12/01/princess-cruises-to-pay-record-breaking-criminal-fine-for-ocean-pollution/
","     Princess Cruise Lines has agreed to plead guilty to seven felony charges and pay a $40 million penalty for polluting the ocean with waste and then trying to cover it up. Federal prosecutors said the payment represents the   criminal penalty involving deliberate pollution by a ship at sea.   Princess is a subsidiary of Carnival Corp. which owns multiple cruise lines that collectively comprise the world’s biggest cruise company. At the heart of the criminal case lies one ship in particular, the   Caribbean Princess, which prosecutors said used a “magic pipe” to bypass the ship’s usual equipment and illegally discharge thousands of gallons of oily waste into the ocean. The practice came to the attention of authorities after an engineer on the ship reported the problem to British investigators in summer 2013. The ship was sailing off the coast of England at the time, and the whistleblowing engineer quit his job when the vessel reached Southampton, England. Officials from the Justice Department said the ship’s chief engineer and senior first engineer tried to cover up the practice, removing the magic pipe and ordering subordinates to lie to authorities. Upon the ship’s arrival in New York the following month,  U. S. Coast Guard investigators conducted an examination of the Caribbean Princess, during which some crew members continued to mislead them about the illegal dumping practice.  Investigators eventually determined that the ship had been making illegal discharges since 2005, the year after the ship was put into service. They also discovered a handful of other illegal practices taking place on the Caribbean Princess and four other ships  —   the Star Princess, Grand Princess, Coral Princess and Golden Princess. The practices included allowing salt water in to prevent alarms from sounding when too much oil was being discharged, and discharging oily bilge water when storage tanks overflowed in the engine room, according to the Justice Department. “The pollution in this case was the result of more than just bad actors on one ship,” Assistant Attorney General John C. Cruden said in a statement Thursday. “It reflects poorly on Princess’s culture and management. This is a company that knew better and should have done better. Hopefully the outcome of this case has the potential not just to chart a new course for this company, but for other companies as well. ” In a statement, Princess said it regretted its actions  —   even as it blamed rogue employees  —   and said it had taken steps to be a better environmental steward in the future. “We are extremely disappointed about the inexcusable actions of our employees who violated our policies and environmental law when they bypassed our bilge water treatment system and discharged untreated bilge water into the ocean,” the company said in a statement.  The company said that when it became aware of the problem in August 2013, executives cooperated with the Justice Department and the Coast Guard while also launching their own internal investigation. “As a result of our investigation we discovered practices, on some other ships, where we were operating out of policy and in violation on environmental law,” the statement said. “Although we had policies and procedures in place, it became apparent they were not fully effective. We are very sorry this happened and have taken additional steps to ensure we meet or exceed all environmental requirements. ” As part of the plea agreement, cruise ships from eight Carnival companies, including Carnival Cruise Line and Holland American Line, will operate for five years under a   “environmental compliance plan,” which will require independent audits and a   monitor. Of the $40 million penalty Princess agreed to pay, $10 million must go toward community service projects to benefit the maritime environment  —   $3 million of that will go to environmental work in South Florida, and another $1 million will go to marine projects in the United Kingdom.

142003,217344,Will a gossipy tabloid be the new paper of record in the Trump administration?,Washington Post,Paul Farhi,2016-12-01,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161202005801/https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/will-a-gossipy-tabloid-be-the-new-paper-of-record-in-the-trump-administration/2016/12/01/be77d838-b73c-11e6-959c-172c82123976_story.html
"," Almost as soon as Donald Trump wrapped up his ostensibly    meeting with TV news executives and anchors last week at Trump Tower, the New York Post’s scrappy gossip column, Page Six, had the first inside account. “It was like a     firing squad,” an anonymous source told the column about Trump’s combative remarks. “The meeting was a total disaster. ” Hmm. “Total disaster. ” Now who does that sound like? And when Melania Trump decided she was staying in New York City rather than moving to the White House so that the Trumps’ young son, Barron, could finish the school year, the Post was first with the news, too. It was sourced to two unnamed people “familiar with the Trump transition. ”  So far, so good in the Age of Trump for the    tabloid. The paper and Trump go way back, to his days as an    New York real estate developer and man about town. Long before he ran for president, long before “The Apprentice,” Trump was the star of hundreds of Post news stories, Page Six items and pieces by the paper’s longtime gossip columnist, Cindy Adams.  During the   drama of his adulterous romance with Marla Maples in the early 1990s, for instance, Trump appeared on the paper’s cover for eight straight days. It was during this stretch that he was the subject of one of the most famous headlines in the paper’s history of famously colorful headlines: “Best Sex I’ve Ever Had,” based on an oversharing quote supposedly uttered by Maples. The paper’s   relationship with Trump may now be paying off with some inside tips about  —   or possibly even from  —   the new   and his inner circle. “It’s his hometown paper,” says a source in the upper reaches of Trumpworld. “He was an eccentric billionaire living in Manhattan. They’ve always had a sort of mutually beneficial relationship. It was proximity and convenience. ” But this source, speaking anonymously so as not to get crosswise with either Trump or the paper, said a past relationship doesn’t guarantee a future one: “I don’t think one paper is better positioned than any other. ” In fact, in his first encounter with print journalists as   last week, Trump met with reporters and editors from the New York Times, the   graduate student to the Post’s rambunctious undergrad in the New York media firmament. The Post doesn’t seem likely to get a visit anytime soon. Nevertheless, the Post can count among its advantages an owner, Rupert Murdoch, who has long wielded political power through his New York media properties (the Post, the Wall Street Journal, Fox News and the TV station WNYW) and has a long relationship with Trump of his own. The Post was among the first major American media assets Murdoch bought when he arrived on these shores from Australia in 1976. He took what had been an afternoon daily under former owner Dorothy Schiff and quickly turned it into a   morning tabloid (“Headless Body in Topless Bar” is perhaps the greatest tab headline ever) resembling his Australian and British papers. Its editorial page morphed from liberal to conservative, in line with Murdoch’s politics.  Even as Murdoch’s horizons expanded globally, the Post remained something like his American Rosebud. He gave up control of the paper in 1988 when federal   rules forced him to choose between it and his New York TV station license. But Murdoch reacquired it five years later, saving it from bankruptcy under a special waiver from the Federal Communications Commission.  Before and since, Murdoch has carried the paper through many   years, including recent ones. Like all newspapers, the Post’s print circulation has slid precipitously; it was down to 231, 000 last month, according to its own account, or less than half of the figure of five years ago. It does far better online, having attracted 28. 8 million unique visitors online in October, according to ComScore, or roughly the same as its arch tabloid rival, the   New York Daily News. As the “firing squad” story of last week suggested, the Post is still wired into Trumpworld through Page Six, the gossip column that Murdoch started upon buying the paper. (The column no longer appears only on Page 6 of the print edition and is no longer a single page.)  Trump’s earliest fame came from his semiregular appearances on Page Six starting soon after the column’s debut in the late 1970s. Many of the items about him were fed to the paper by Roy Cohn, Trump’s lawyer and his mentor in the dark arts of media manipulation. “I think Page Six definitely played a role in helping push Donald Trump to the first round of his   whatever,” commented Susan Mulcahy, one of the column’s earliest reporters and editors, in a 2004 oral history of it for Vanity Fair. “It definitely helped create his first level of celebrity hell. I wrote about him a certain amount, but I actually would sit back and be amazed at how often people would write about him in a completely gullible way. ”  Emily Smith, the British expat who now edits and writes for Page Six, has reported from within Trump Tower before. In addition to last week’s “firing squad” story, she scored a   last week by reporting that Stephanie Winston Wolkoff, the organizer of the glamorous annual Met Gala, has been brought on by Melania Trump to help organize inaugural events. (Smith did not respond to requests for comment; a spokeswoman for the paper said it would “pass” on commenting for this story.) One of the Post’s big scoops during the campaign was its publication of nude photos of Melania (cover line: “The Ogle Office”) in late July. But Trump quickly extinguished any controversy over the photos, taken while she was a model in 1995, when he told the paper, “In Europe, pictures like this are very fashionable and common. ” One veteran New York journalist said it was plausible that Page Six could enjoy improved access to a Trump White House. “Old habits die hard,” he said. “I would not be surprised if Donald Trump has Emily Smith’s landline and cell number memorized. ” Then again, maybe not. “I think Page Six was the monster gossip column of all gossip columns at a time when the Post and other papers were voraciously consumed in the   format,” says Lloyd Grove, an editor at large at the Daily Beast who once wrote The Washington Post’s Reliable Source column and later a gossip column for the Daily News. “Like every other newspaper brand, it has suffered from the Balkanization of the media landscape. It’s now such a fractionalized environment. You hardly need Page Six when you can get all the news, fake news and gossip you want from your Facebook feed. ”  Some things may not have changed. In her reminiscence about Page Six in 2004, and in a piece she wrote for Politico this year, Mulcahy recalled numerous instances in which Trump misdirected or lied to her as she was reporting on him. “He was a great character,” she told Vanity Fair, “but he was full of crap 90 percent of the time. ” To which Trump himself replied to Vanity Fair: “I agree with her 100 percent. ” "

","     “The Daily Show” is trying to do something about the liberal media echo chamber. Trevor Noah invited conservative commentator Tomi Lahren on his show last night for a lengthy debate, during which the two hashed out everything from Black Lives Matter to the Affordable Care Act to Donald Trump’s   recording. Lahren is the host of TheBlaze’s “Tomi,” and Noah showed a clip of her show to give his audience  —   who quite possibly had never seen her series  —   a little introduction to her viewpoints. Coming across as an enraged version of Hayden Panettiere, Lahren railed against protesters (“crybabies with nothing better to do”) Occupy Wall Street “brats” and “the militant” Black Lives Matter movement. “Why are you so angry?” Noah asked after the clip rolled. “I’m actually not that angry,” she responded. “It’s just that there are things that need to be said, Trevor, and a lot of people are afraid to say them. ” Lahren, who said that being on his show was basically coming into the lion’s den, seemed understandably more nervous than Noah, who maintained the same   tone for most of the interview. The    was more reasonable than most of the presidential debates, at least, with both sides giving impassioned responses to one another in comprehensible English. Lahren admitted that what Trump said to Billy Bush about making unwanted sexual advances on women was indefensible, but she maintained that  —   even though she was a   “Marco Rubio girl”  —   once Trump was the Republican nominee, she had no choice but to support him. “It was not a good day for Trump supporters,” she said of the tape release. “But I’m still comparing someone who said some nasty things, to a woman [Hillary Clinton] who has done nasty things. ” When Noah asked her what her intention was with hosting her show, the South Dakota native said she wanted to give a voice to the people ignored by the coasts, who might be too afraid to speak out for fear of being labeled. “You can call me whatever the hell you want, I won’t back down,” Lahren promised.

When Lahren said she believed Trump was   and reasonable, Noah asked, “Do you have Twitter?” And when she claimed she doesn’t see color  —   which stirred up the audience  —   the “Daily Show” host asked her what she does at traffic lights. “For somebody who’s not racist, you have to spend a lot of time saying, ‘I’m not racist,’” he told her, but she maintained her cool. After a discussion of her criticism of Colin Kaepernick’s personal form of peaceful protest, she even offered to have the 49ers quarterback on her show. The only time she seemed especially rattled was when Noah told her that, with Trump’s win, she was now part of the mainstream media. Of course, like every other topic, the two ultimately just agreed to disagree. Neither made much headway in convincing the other to   and both held their own enough so that liberals could have seen Noah as the victor while conservatives could have claimed Lahren won. When Noah asked Lahren if there was any misconception about her she wished she could clear up, she said, “I wish we could disagree with each other without [people] thinking that we are bad people or   folks. ” In the end, that was the point of the spectacle: to show that two people with opposing views can have a relatively civil conversation. They can even publicly support each other on Twitter.   Thank you for being my guest Tomi. Our goal should be to destroy these ”bubbles” not each other.

","         Early in the campaign, a    girl dressed as Hillary Clinton for Halloween, wearing a blazer and carrying a briefcase, met her idol. The candidate, then vying for the Democratic nomination, posed for a picture with her   after an event in the girl’s home town of Charleston, S. C. in 2015. Clinton told her she looked like a future president. Jennifer Jones’s daughter, Sullivan, cherished the picture, now framed in her bedroom, showing a smiling Clinton crouching behind her with both hands on her little shoulders.    Hillary Clinton poses with    Sullivan at the event in Charleston, S. C. (Courtesy of Jennifer Jones via Hillary for America)  But more than a year later  —   the day after Clinton lost the election and as Jones was processing her own grief over the loss  —   their treasured photo was turned into something sinister. Someone had taken the photo, originally uploaded to the Clinton campaign Flickr page, and turned it into a meme that was then shared thousands of times across social media. Bold white type across the top of the image read, “I AM FOR WOMEN’S RIGHTS!” Then halfway down, text covering the lower half of Sullivan’s body accused Clinton of accepting money and refugees from countries “that would mutilate this girl’s genitals, marry her to a Muslim pedophile, and stone her to death if she doesn’t wear a bedsheet. ” Jones hadn’t been on social media. So she didn’t see that a friend had shared the image to her Facebook page asking if she’d seen it. Another friend took a screenshot of it and sent it to her in a text message. For    Jones, who works the overnight shift at a local hotel so she can be at home during the day for her two daughters, it felt like a personal failing. That night, after she gave Sullivan a bath and put her to bed, she searched for the photo online and found thousands of blogs and feeds on Instagram and Pinterest and Facebook that shared the image. She believed what she’d always been told: Once something is on the Internet, it’s there forever. “I felt like I failed her,” Jones said. “As a mother, your job is to protect and fix things, and I wasn’t able to fix it. I’ve never felt so low in my life with this image being out there that I had no control over. ” She traced one photo to a Facebook page, “Men for Donald Trump,” which has more than 200, 000 followers. She implored them to take it down. At first they resisted, but after dozens of her friends bombarded them with messages, they obliged. It was a victory, but a small one. That was only one site. There were countless more. Was it even possible to go to each one and make the same request? She reported hundreds to social media sites and Google, but that wasn’t going to purge the image of her little girl from the Internet. She makes $10 an hour at her hotel job. She couldn’t afford to hire an attorney. Several days later, she posted about it on Pantsuit Nation, the Facebook group of more than 3 million that started as a secret   page and has morphed into a massive online community where people share stories and seek support. Jones asked if they could help her report the image   . Soon messages poured into her inbox offering help. This person knew someone at Pinterest who could help; another had a contact at the Center for Missing and Exploited Children. Then she got a message from Shaun Kozolchyk, the San Francisco director of development for the   League. “I am a mother of my own two daughters. I was so horrified and deeply affected by that post and knew the work we do at ADL could be a space that could be helpful,” Kozolchyk said. She contacted a colleague who works on   response issues, who immediately verified that the Clinton campaign held the copyright to that photo. Any unauthorized use of it was against the law. The ADL sent a   notice to the originating sites and, soon after, it disappeared from the Internet. “When I got all this response from all these people from all over the country, it’s going to sound cheesy, but it felt like this giant blue blanket of love wrapped over me, and I didn’t feel alone anymore,” Jones said. “There were so many people, who said, ‘we got you. ’” But what happened next gives Jones reason to believe her fight had a wider cause. When she shared again on Pantsuit Nation what the ADL had been able to do, others started coming forward saying their child’s image had been used in a meme. They just didn’t think there was anything they could do about it. Kozolchyk said the ADL is now working on about a dozen similar cases to get these memes removed. “Every day I come into work and we are bombarded with cases of hate and bigotry. You start to feel deflated and hopeless, but you have to keep pushing,” Kozolchyk said. “Then you get this kind of victory, and it carries you through to the next thing. ” Read more Inspired Life: ‘It’s unprecedented in our history’: Trump’s election inspired millions in nonprofit donations ‘You Belong.

","   Donald Trump spoke Friday with Taiwan’s president, a major departure from decades of U. S. policy in Asia and a breach of diplomatic protocol with ramifications for the incoming president’s relations with China. The call is the first known contact between a U. S. president or   with a Taiwanese leader since before the United States broke diplomatic relations with the island in 1979. China considers Taiwan a province, and news of the official outreach by Trump is likely to infuriate the regional military and economic power. The exchange is one of a string of unorthodox conversations with foreign leaders that Trump has held since his election. It comes at a particularly tense time between China and Taiwan, which earlier this year elected a president, Tsai   who has refused to accept the notion of a unified China under Beijing’s rule. Her election angered Beijing to the point of cutting off all official communication with the island government. It is not clear whether Trump intends a more formal shift in U. S. relations with Taiwan or China. On the call, Trump and Tsai congratulated each other on winning their elections, a statement from Trump’s transition office said.       Donald Trump talks with workers during a visit to the Carrier factory on Dec. 1 in Indianapolis. (Jabin   Washington Post)  “During the discussion, they noted the close economic, political, and security ties . . . between Taiwan and the United States,” a statement from Trump’s transition office said.  A spokeswoman for Taiwan in the United States said she could not immediately confirm that the conversation took place and said she was seeking guidance from Taiwan. The conversation was first reported by the Financial Times and the Taipei Times. The   tweeted out Friday evening, “The president of Taiwan CALLED ME today to wish me congratulations on winning the Presidency. ” The United States has pursued what it calls a “One China” policy since 1972, when   Richard M. Nixon visited China. In 1978, President Jimmy Carter recognized Beijing as the only government of both mainland China and Taiwan, and Washington closed its embassy in Taiwan a year later. China guards the structures of its formal relationship with the United States very carefully  —   especially the founding document that established the One China policy. U. S. officials typically tiptoe around any mention of Taiwan or the Chinese goal of full reunification. “This phone call calls into question whether or not Trump adheres to the basic foundation of the U. S.  relationship,” said Evan Medeiros, a former top China adviser to President Obama who is now an adviser at the  Eurasia Group. “This action guarantees that U. S.  relations under Trump will get off to a very rocky start. ” Trump’s growing team of   and   advisers includes several people who have been strong supporters of Taiwan in Republican administrations. They include Stephen Yates, deputy national security adviser under Vice President Richard B. Cheney, who was reported to be visiting Taiwan when the call occurred. Trump apparently considered hotel investments in Taiwan earlier this year. The mayor of Taoyuan said last month that a representative from the Trump Organization had visited and was interested in constructing hotels in the northwestern Taiwanese city, according to China Times. Trump has said he will separate himself from his businesses before he is inaugurated. In recent years, in the face of Taiwan’s waning economic power and decreasing international recognition as a separate entity from mainland China, Taiwanese diplomatic representatives in Washington have been trying to raise their stature. They have courted government officials and journalists with Taiwanese film screenings, expensive soirees and other cultural events around town.  For years it has looked like a losing battle. But the Trump call could constitute a major and unexpected coup for Taiwan’s new administration by showing the island’s continued relevance. Michael J. Green, a senior Asia adviser to President George W. Bush, said the call will not necessarily lead to lasting bad blood with China. “Taiwan is a very good friend, and it is good to let the world know that,” Green said, adding, “The  ’s phone call may have been unconventional, but it’s not completely unprecedented. ” President Ronald Reagan infuriated the Chinese by inviting a Taiwanese delegation to his inaugural ball, and his administration included a   tussle over whether to “   Taiwan,” Green said. Bush caused a kerfuffle when he suggested the United States might defend Taiwan militarily, but that, too, blew over, Green noted. Earlier Friday, Trump reportedly extended an invitation for Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte to visit the United States next year. That what would mark a startling turnabout for a foreign leader who famously called Obama a “son of a whore. ” Trump transition officials confirmed the Duterte call but did not say whether Trump had issued the invitation. Perhaps not surprisingly, the   Republican has infused the usually banal routine of congratulatory calls from foreign leaders with drama. Most of the more than 50 calls held by Trump or Vice   Mike Pence came without the knowledge or guidance of the State Department. That means no talking points about issues of particular importance  —   or land mines to avoid. “We stand by to assist and facilitate and support communication that the transition team is having with foreign leaders,” State Department spokesman John Kirby said Friday. The calls have appeared haphazard and out of order  —   Russia and Ireland before close ally Britain, for example  —   and the conversations have a casual tone that the British press sniffed is  “ . ” Some calls, as described by Trump aides or the other country, have elicited a raised eyebrow or two. There was Trump’s offhand suggestion to British Prime Minister Theresa May to “let me know” if she happened to be coming to town. A state visit typically takes months of planning and involves a numbing amount of diplomatic protocol of the    variety. And there was the conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin in which the two agreed, according to the Kremlin, “on the absolutely unsatisfactory state of bilateral relations” and committed to “normalize” the relationship. The United States and Russia maintain cordial official ties  —   Secretary of State John F. Kerry met with the Russian foreign minister Friday  —   but both countries have accused the other of meddling. Some Trump communications have yielded questions and worries among U. S. diplomats and foreign powers, most notably a call Wednesday between Trump and Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif. A vivid account of the conversation released by Pakistan has Trump heaping praise on Sharif as “a terrific guy” and Pakistanis as “one of the most intelligent people. ” The United States  —   and Trump when he was a candidate  —   have said Pakistan has not done enough to combat terrorism, and the   country would be heavily affected by Trump’s proposed restrictions on Muslim immigration. Nonetheless, when Sharif invited him to visit Pakistan, Trump replied that he would “love to come to a fantastic country, fantastic place of fantastic people,” the Pakistani statement said. A Trump statement came with no such color, but transition officials did not disavow the quotes. Most disturbing to diplomats in the United States and elsewhere was the Pakistani account of Trump pledging partnership that could suggest favoritism in Pakistan’s eternal  —   and nuclear armed  —   rivalry with India. Trump told Sharif he would “play any role you want me to play to address and find solutions to the country’s problems,” according to the Pakistani account. China, North Korea and Russia, as well as India, are likely to take note of that, diplomats said. “The one thing you learn is, you’ve got to be very careful what you say because everything you say or tweet matters,” said William Danvers, a former senior official in the Obama State Department, Pentagon and CIA. “You have a grace period when you’re president and you deserve it, but it’s mostly a domestic grace period,” Danvers said. “It’s not as if Kim Jong Un is going to say, ‘Oh you just became president, so I’ll hold off on my missile test.’ It kind of makes us look like we don’t know what we’re doing. ” As for Duterte, who had announced a public “breakup” with the United States before the election, the State Department’s Kirby said little. “I don’t know of any specific support that was provided for that call,” he said. “Our job is to make sure they know we are a ready resource. How they make decisions and how they conduct dialogue and communication with foreign leaders is really for them to decide. ” Trump communications director Jason Miller told reporters Friday that the calls are not off the cuff. Trump and Pence “are briefed in advance of their calls, obviously working with the teams that we have put together,” Miller said before news of the Duterte call had broken. White House press secretary Josh Earnest urged Trump to take advantage of diplomatic   as he contacts foreign leaders ahead of his inauguration in January. “I’m confident that as   Trump takes office, those same State Department employees will stand ready to offer him advice as he conducts the business of the United States overseas,” Earnest said. “Hopefully he’ll take it. ” Trump’s outreach to Duterte could echo Obama’s election pledge to try to talk to adversaries, although Trump has denounced Obama’s main claims to success in that effort  —   openings to Iran and Cuba. Obama presided over a reversal of the U. S. relationship with the Philippines and its new leader. Duterte’s denunciations of the longtime alliance between the two nations and personal insults of Obama prompted the president to cancel a planned meeting with Duterte in China in September.  Duterte has said U. S. troops should leave his country within two years. He also cozied up to Chinese President Xi Jinping, alarming the Obama administration, which had backed the Philippines’ challenge at an international tribunal last summer over China’s maritime claims in waters used by Filipino fishermen. The tribunal ruled against China, but Duterte has signaled a willingness to negotiate a deal with Beijing that could allow the Chinese navy to remain in control of the region.

142007,217353,Trump supporters aggressively challenge Stein recount efforts in three states,Washington Post,Jerry Markon,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161203001010/https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-supporters-aggressively-challenge-stein-recount-efforts-in-three-states/2016/12/02/bfc4d256-b8bb-11e6-959c-172c82123976_story.html
"," Supporters of   Donald Trump are moving aggressively to challenge Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein’s push for a recount in three states, filing legal challenges and criticizing the effort as quixotic and  . Trump and his backers have filed challenges the past two days in Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, which were critical to Trump’s surprise victory last month because they punctured the   blue wall of states expected to carry Democrat Hillary Clinton to victory. Trump narrowly won the trio of states. Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette (R) on Friday tweeted that Stein’s request was “an expensive & a risky threat” as he announced he had filed an emergency motion with the Michigan Supreme Court to stop it.  Stein, who has raised millions of dollars from supporters to help pay for the costly recount efforts, blasted back at what she called “a politically motivated attempt by Bill Schuette to side with Donald Trump in opposition to a fair and accountable voting system. ’’ She added in a statement that “citizens in Michigan and across the country of every political party have expressed their concerns around our voting system and deserve to have their votes counted. ’’      Here are the people whose names have been floated for Trump’s Cabinet View Graphic     Here are the people whose names have been floated for Trump’s Cabinet  Stein has raised concerns about possible hacking or other irregularities in the vote in the three states, but has presented no evidence of malfeasance. Election officials in all three states have expressed confidence in their results, and voting rights experts have said the effort is highly unlikely to overturn the results that are sending Trump to the White House. Clinton’s campaign has joined Stein’s recount effort, though her team has said it does not expect the outcome of the election to change. The Clinton campaign had no immediate comment on Friday. In Wisconsin, where Trump defeated Clinton by one percentage point, a recount is underway. But Great America PAC and Stop Hillary PAC, both   groups, said Friday they had filed a legal challenge a day earlier in federal court in conjunction with a Wisconsin voter to stop the new count. Stein’s team said Friday that it will fight the challenge.  “Citizens in Wisconsin and across the country have made it clear that they want a recount and deserve to see this process through to ensure integrity in the vote,” Stein attorney Matthew D. Brinckerhoff said in a statement. In Pennsylvania, where Stein has acknowledged the path to forcing a recount is more difficult but has initiated an effort to do so nonetheless, attorneys for Trump filed an objection to Stein’s request in state court on Thursday. “Even with the heroic efforts by state and local elections officials involved in the recounts, as well as expeditious review by this Court, Stein’s proposed process will last weeks, perhaps even months. Either way, her request puts Pennsylvania at grave risk of having not certified its Presidential electors by December 13, the deadline for doing so,” says the filing.  On Friday, the focus of the escalating battle was in Michigan, as the Board of State Canvassers deadlocked   over an objection that attorneys for Trump filed Thursday against Stein’s recount request. Trump argued that Stein cannot, as the state’s   finisher, claim that she is “aggrieved” by the way the vote unfolded and that there isn’t enough time to complete the recount by the Dec. 13 deadline to certify Michigan’s election results.     Retired U. S. Marine Corps General James Mattis has been chosen to be secretary of defense by   Donald Trump, according to people familiar with the decision. (Jenny   Washington Post)   Because of the deadlock, the office of Michigan Secretary of State Ruth Johnson (R) said in a tweet that “the recount is expected to commence early next week, barring court action. ”  Schuette then filed his emergency motion with the Michigan Supreme Court. It was not immediately clear whether a hearing has been set. The earliest a Michigan recount could start would be next week.  Meanwhile, the   resumed his schedule of transition meetings at Manhattan’s Trump Tower on Friday, bringing in two   experts on foreign policy. The   met with Robert M. Gates, who served as defense secretary under President Obama and had derided Trump as “unqualified and unfit to be   ” in a September   in the Wall Street Journal. Gates spoke briefly with reporters afterward, saying he had praised Trump’s selection of retired Marine Gen. James N. Mattis as defense secretary, which Trump announced Thursday. “I told him I thought his selection of General Mattis to be secretary of defense was terrific, very supportive,” said Gates, who declined to answer further questions. Trump also sat down with John Bolton, a former ambassador to the United Nations. He was at one point considered a candidate for secretary of state, but Kellyanne Conway, one of Trump’s top advisers, told Fox News on Friday that Trump has narrowed that search to four finalists. According to Conway, they are 2012 GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney, former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani, retired Army Gen. David Petraeus and Sen. Bob Corker ( .) chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Opponents of Romney have waged an extraordinary public campaign against his nomination for the post and urged Trump to reward Giuliani for his loyalty during the campaign. It is unclear when Trump will make a final decision.    Alice Crites contributed to this report.  "

"," You may think you are prepared for a   world, in which political appeals to emotion count for more than statements of verifiable fact. But now it’s time to cross another bridge  —   into a world without facts. Or, more precisely, where facts do not matter a whit. On live radio Wednesday morning, Scottie Nell Hughes sounded breezy as she drove a stake into the heart of knowable reality: “There’s no such thing, unfortunately, anymore, of facts,” she declared on “The Diane Rehm Show” on Wednesday. Hughes, a frequent surrogate for   Donald Trump and a paid commentator for CNN during the campaign, kept on defending that assertion at length, though not with much clarity of expression. Rehm had pressed her about Trump’s recent   assertion on Twitter that he, not Hillary Clinton, would have won the popular vote if millions of immigrants had not voted illegally.     A shouting match erupted at an election postmortem session, where aides from both campaigns met to discuss the election. The Washington Post’s Margaret Sullivan and Callum Borchers talk about what happened. (The Washington Post)   (The apparent gen esis of Trump’s claim was Infowars. com, a site that traffics in conspiracy theories and is run by Alex Jones, who says the 2012 massacre of 20 schoolchildren in Newtown, Conn. was a   hoax.) What matters now, Hughes argued, is not whether his fraud claim is true. No, what matters is who believes it. “Mr. Trump’s tweet, amongst a certain crowd, a large  —   a large part of the population, are truth. When he says that millions of people illegally voted, he has some  —   in his  —   amongst him and his supporters, and people believe they have facts to back that up. Those that do not like Mr. Trump, they say that those are lies, and there’s no facts to back it up. ” Yes, it’s a fact: I heard it live, as did Rehm, Politico’s Glenn Thrush, and the Atlantic’s James Fallows, who wrote about it, citing a recording of the show. One might be tempted, though, to dismiss it as one woman’s opinion: Maybe Hughes, the political editor of RightAlerts. com, was just having a hallucinatory day. But at a   event the next evening, two other Trump surrogates echoed this sentiment. Ousted Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, speaking during an election   at Harvard University’s Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy, blamed journalists for  —   yes  —   believing what his candidate said. “You guys took everything that Donald Trump said so literally,” said Lewandowski, who was another   CNN hire. “The American people didn’t. They understood it. They understood that sometimes  —   when you have a conversation with people, whether it’s around the dinner table or at a bar  —   you’re going to say things, and sometimes you don’t have all the facts to back it up. ”     Hear from The Washington Post reporters who criscrossed the country to cover Donald J. Trump, Hillary Clinton and the voters who will choose one of them to be president. (Bastien   Washington Post)   Yes, Corey, but Trump is not a guy at a bar; he was the Republican nominee for president of the United States and will pretty soon be the leader of the free world, such as it is. So, how should Trump’s statements during the campaign have been covered? Should reporters have added something like this in the second paragraph of every news story? “Trump probably didn’t mean that he would appoint a special   a   millions of immigrants. His statements are not meant to be taken literally but rather as broad suggestions of a feeling he was experiencing on a particular day. ” There was more from the Harvard event. When CNN’s Jake Tapper asked Trump senior adviser Kellyanne Conway about the same   claim discussed above  —   specifically, whether disseminating misinformation was “presidential”  —   it was clear that she and Hughes got the same memo. “He’s the   so that’s presidential behavior,” Conway said, using     reminiscent of the Nixonian “When the president does it, that means that it’s not illegal. ” These surrogates’ disdain for facts should not be surprising, given Trump’s own casual relationship with verifiable truth. It’s time to dust off your old copy of “1984 ” by George Orwell and recall this passage: “The Ministry of Peace concerns itself with war, the Ministry of Truth with lies, the Ministry of Love with torture and the Ministry of Plenty with starvation. These contradictions are not accidental, nor do they result from ordinary hypocrisy: they are deliberate exercises in doublethink. ” And be vigilant.  For more by Margaret Sullivan visit wapo.   "
142009,217356,Trump’s Carrier deal could permanently damage American capitalism,Washington Post,Lawrence H. Summers,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161203001010/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/12/02/why-trumps-carrier-deal-is-bad-for-america/
","         There are many aspects of the economic policy of the new administration that I find misguided. But I am most troubled by what   Donald Trump did with Carrier to hold on to an extra 700 jobs in Indiana. Ronald Reagan’s response to the air traffic controllers’ strike was a small act that had profound consequences. I fear in a similar way that the negotiation with Carrier is a small thing that is actually a very big thing  —   a change very much for the worse with regards to the operating assumptions of American capitalism. Market economies can operate anywhere along a continuum between two poles. I have always thought of American capitalism as dominantly rule and law based. Courts enforce contracts and property rights in ways that are largely independent of just who it is who is before them. Taxes are calculable on the basis of an arithmetic algorithm. Companies and governments buy from the cheapest bidder. Regulation follows previously promulgated rules. In the economic arena, the state’s monopoly on the use of force is used to enforce contract and property rights and to enforce previously promulgated laws. Even though we know of instances of corruption, abuse of power, favoritism and selective enforcement, we take this   system for granted.  But looking around the world today or back through American history, this model is hardly a norm. Many market economies operate what might be called ad hoc or   capitalism: Economic actors assume that they have to protect their property and do their own contract enforcement. Tax collectors use discretion in assessing taxes. Companies and governments buy from their friends rather than seek   bids.  Regulators abuse their power. The state’s monopoly on the use of force is used to enrich and satisfy the desires of those who control the apparatus of the state. This is the world of New York City under Tammany Hall, of Suharto’s Indonesia, and of Putin’s Russia. Reliance on rules and law has enormous advantages. It greatly increases predictability and reduces uncertainty. It reduces expenditures on both guarding property and seeking to appropriate property. It promotes freedom because most of the people most of the time do not take political positions with a view to gaining commercial advantage. The advantages of the rule of law are so great that I would claim that there is no country more than   as rich as the United States that does not have a strong tradition of the rule of   capitalism.  And I know of no country where the people are free where the rule of law does not largely govern market interactions.        Donald Trump and vice   Pence have convinced air conditioning manufacturer Carrier to keep 1, 000 jobs at its Indianapolis, Ind. plant instead of moving them to Mexico. This is a major publicity score for Trump who had previously criticized Carrier and other manufacturers on the campaign trail. But putting pressure on individual businesses doesn’t make for a winning long term strategy. Wonkblog’s Jim Tankersley explains. (Daron   Washington Post)   What about Carrier? The   of the United States decided in a purely ad hoc basis that he wanted Carrier to remain in Indiana. He deployed some combination of carrots and sticks at his disposal to lever Carrier into doing what he wanted. Implicitly or explicitly, there must have been sticks, as press accounts suggest that the tax benefits provided offset only a small part of the savings forgone by staying in Indiana. It is not hard to see from the point of view of United Technologies, the parent of Carrier, that for a company with more than $50 billion in revenue it’s surely worth $60 million to not be on the wrong side of a possibly vindictive president of the United States. It seems to me what we have just witnessed is an act of ad hoc deal capitalism and, worse yet, its celebration as a model. As with the air traffic controllers, only a negligible sliver of the economy is involved, but there is huge symbolic value. A principle is being established: It is good for the president to try to figure out what people want and lean on companies to give it to them. Predictability and procedure are less important than getting the right result at the right time. Like Hong Kong, as mainland China increasingly imposes its will, we may have taken a first step toward a kind of reverse transition from rule of law capitalism to ad hoc   capitalism. The commentary on the  ’s actions has emphasized its novelty, has emphasized the difficulties of scaling, and in the case of Sen. Bernie Sanders ( .) has argued that the actions taken were insufficiently forceful because some workers will still be relocated to Mexico. All of this misses the point. Presidents have enormous latent power, and it is the custom of restraint in its use that is one of the important differences between us and banana republics. If its ad hoc use is licensed, the possibilities are endless. Most companies will prefer the good to the bad will of the U. S. president and his leadership team. Should that reality be levered to get them to locate where the president wants, to make contributions to the president’s reelection campaign, to hire people the president wants to see hired, to do the kinds of research the president wants carried out, or to lend money to those that the president wants to see assisted?

","     Determined not to let any Trump action go unchallenged, the media has been full of comments from economists (including Larry Summers and Justin Wolfers) that Donald Trump’s intervention to save jobs at Carrier’s Indiana facility is just a showman’s    —   that it can’t be easily replicated and will be ultimately ineffective in changing the job prospects in a country that creates and destroys a couple of million jobs every month. This is simply not the way things are done in a country that values free markets and the rule of law. Methinks they are missing the story. One of the blind spots economists have is around norms of behavior  —   the unwritten rules that are the guiderails for how people act. There was a time in America when there was an unwritten pact in the business world  —   workers were loyal to their companies and successful companies returned that loyalty by sharing some of their profits with their workers in the form of higher wages, job security and support for the local community. In some cases, this social contract was reinforced by a union contract, but it was also embraced even in   situations because there was a broad public consensus that it was the right thing to do. Business leaders conformed to the norm not only because it helped them attract good workers and customers and have clout in dealing with governmental leaders, but also because it made them feel good about themselves. Then came the 1980s, and all that began to change as American industry began to falter because of foreign competition. Consumers decide they cared more about cheaper products than socially conscious corporate behavior. And just as significantly, investors, after years of lousy returns, decided they cared more about maximizing shareholder value than they did about maximizing the social value of the enterprise they owned. So the social norm changed. A new breed of corporate executive, incented with boatloads of stock options, decided that the right thing to do was to cut costs at any price, including the economic health of their workers or their communities. Indeed, for a while, if a corporate executive didn’t have an aggressive plan to shift production overseas, they were criticized by Wall Street and the business press and threatened with takeovers by what we now call “activist investors. ” Although the public never much liked the idea of closing plants and shipping jobs overseas, it no longer was socially unacceptable. Now comes Donald Trump  —   in the public mind, a successful businessman  —   who as the new president, suddenly declares that the new norm is no longer acceptable, and he intends to do whatever he can to shame and punish companies that abandon their workers. It’s one thing for a company to sustain a few days of bad headlines in the local newspaper when it decides to close a facility. It’s quite another when the president of the United States is not only willing, but from a political point eager, to make a federal case out of it. Suddenly, maximizing shareholder value no longer provides the political and social inoculation that it used to. Unlike their patron saint, Adam Smith,   economists tend to ignore such shifts in social norms because they can’t quantify them in the same way they can quantify trade flows or technological innovation or changes in educational attainment. And if they can’t quantify something, they can’t include it in their complex mathematical models, or even the simpler mental models in their heads of how the economy operates. They assume that social norms change in response to economic fundamentals rather than the other way around. Donald Trump understands better. He knows that he and his new commerce secretary will have to engage in a few more bouts of   arm twisting before the message finally sinks in in the  . He may even have to make an example of a runaway company by sending in the tax auditors or the OSHA inspectors or cancelling a big government contract. It won’t matter that, two years later, these highly publicized retaliations are thrown out by a federal judge somewhere. Most companies won’t want to risk such threats to their “brands. ” They will find a way to conform to the new norm, somewhat comforted by the fact that their American competitors have been forced to do the same. Just as much as changes in the law, this is how norms of business behavior are changed. Teddy and Franklin Roosevelt understood that. So did Ronald Reagan when he fired thousands of striking air traffic controllers and set back the union movement for several decades. Barack Obama, not so much. And here’s a little secret: Privately, many of the executives will welcome the change. They chafe under the tyranny of maximizing shareholder value and they don’t like being widely viewed as ruthless and selfish. In his bombastic, narcissistic,   way, Donald Trump may have actually done them a favor.

","  CINCINNATI  —   Susan Meyer becomes giddy as she explains just how excited she is for   Donald Trump to take office. Her tone changes at the mention of “secretary of state. ” Meyer trusts Trump, but she simply doesn’t understand why he would put Mitt Romney on his shortlist to head the State Department. It’s not that she doesn’t like Romney; she voted for him in 2012 and considers him fully capable. But how could Trump forget the things Romney said about him during the primary? Why would he trust someone like that? “He outwardly spoke against him in a malicious way,” said Meyer, a retired teacher in her 70s who once taught students for whom English was a second language. “Is he loyal? Is he going to be loyal to the president? I would question that. ” In the three weeks since Trump won the election, he has dropped or leaned away from a number of key campaign promises, puzzling some of his supporters. Appointing a special prosecutor to investigate former rival Hillary Clinton is no longer a top priority for Trump, who sympathetically said that Clinton already “went through a lot. ” He has said he is now open to amending the Affordable Care Act instead of fully repealing it. And several of his Cabinet picks are longtime players on Wall Street or in Washington  —   the “swamp,” in Trump’s words, that he has pledged to drain.        Donald Trump held a rally in Cincinnati on Thursday, part of what his team has called the USA Thank You Tour 2016. (Victoria   Washington Post)   Many of Trump’s supporters who showed up to his first   rally in this Midwestern city Thursday night said they completely trust their   to make the right decisions for the country, even if they don’t understand his motives. And they were quick to come up with explanations for why he’s doing what he’s doing  —   like suddenly being buddies with Romney. Meyer said that Trump is “trying to bring the party together” after the bruising election. The guy sitting behind her at the rally agreed. “If he could be someone who could really benefit his Cabinet and be better for America, I say go for it,” said Joe Terry, a    father of five who works in maintenance. Terry said he has no problem with Trump’s pick for treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, a former Goldman Sachs executive and Hollywood producer who   a bank during the financial crisis that foreclosed on thousands of homeowners. “Let’s face it, he’s going to look out for corporations, to make things work for them, to bring jobs back home,” Terry said. “And as things trickle down  —   as they’re going to because it’s America  —   the little guy will get something, too. ” For secretary of state, Meyer said she hopes Trump will ultimately pick someone like former New York mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, who stood by Trump when few would, or retired Gen. David H. Petraeus, who pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge of mishandling classified material and is still on probation. “He paid the price,” said Meyer, who lives across the river from Cincinnati in northern Kentucky. “When you pay the price, then you’re forgiven. And he did a fraction of what Hillary did. ”     Here are the people whose names have been floated for Trump’s Cabinet View Graphic     Here are the people whose names have been floated for Trump’s Cabinet   Meyer’s favorite debate moment was when Trump told Clinton that if he were president, she would be in jail. “He looked right at her, and I loved it,” she said. But Meyer and her husband said that while they want to see Clinton held responsible for using a private email server while secretary of state, neither of them expected Trump to take on the issue himself. “I know what he was saying, but the president can’t prosecute anybody,” said Robert “Bob” Meyer. “I think that’s out of Trump’s hands. He should leave it to the Justice Department, and she should be prosecuted. ” His wife agreed, adding: “It was a debate. . . . He doesn’t always think. He’s not a politician. He just says it. ” Still, at Trump’s first mention of Clinton during the rally that night, the whole arena began chanting: “Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up!”  Trump stood by and smiled. Sitting one section over from the Meyers was another couple in their 70s who were convinced that Trump’s change in tone on Clinton is just a strategic act.  “I don’t think it would stick anyhow because Obama could pardon her,” explained Bob Knopp, 74, a retired civil engineer. “I think it’s really too early for him to really say a whole lot about anything. When Obama gets out of there, it might change again. ” For Susan Meyer, it feels like the country has already changed since the election  —   and she gave Trump credit for keeping open a Carrier furnace factory in Indianapolis rather than letting it move all of its jobs to Mexico. “It made my heart feel good to know that these families will have a Christmas,” she said. “I felt so good when he did that. And that’s what I love about him. He didn’t wait until his inauguration. He did it. He’s a worker. He started calling up, and he’s Donald Trump, and they listened to him. ” The deal didn’t happen quite that way. Carrier agreed not to shift about 800 manufacturing and management positions south of the border, in exchange for a $7 million incentive package from the state. About 1, 300 jobs will still move to Mexico, however.  Meyer and other Trump supporters shrugged at these details, saying that’s just how business works. “At least he put forth the effort,” she said. “And he might not be able to do that with everybody. . . . But I want us to start producing things again. I want to buy a clothes item that’s made in the good ol’ U. S. A. I want to buy a sweeper that comes from the U. S. A. We don’t produce, and that really bothers me. ” Meyer is hopeful that Trump will ease environmental restrictions to allow factories to open more easily  —   and create millions of jobs, secure the border, protect the country from terrorists, reduce the influence of wealthy lobbyists and rebuild the inner cities. She told her friends that if Trump doesn’t deliver, they can “boot him out. ” “I want him to achieve,” she said. “He might not be able to do everything all at once, but as long as he progresses and shows that he’s trying, making an effort, okay. But I will hold him to some of those promises. ” "
142012,217359,Trump’s latest conduct shows he’ll make our divisions a lot worse,Washington Post,Paul Waldman,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161203001010/https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2016/12/02/trumps-latest-conduct-shows-hell-make-our-divisions-a-lot-worse/
","         There may never in American history have been a president who tried harder to unify the country, and got as little credit for it from his opponents, as Barack Obama. Despite being unfailingly thoughtful and always insisting political disagreements weren’t personal, Obama was portrayed by Republicans as some kind of   rage monster whose only goal was to set Americans against each other. They attacked him for not being enough of a unifier while simultaneously accusing him of intentionally trying to destroy the country. Well now we’re going to see what it’s really like to have a president who wants to divide the country. Donald Trump and the people who work for him are giving new meaning to the term “sore winner,” and there’s no reason to think they’ll change anything once he’s actually in the Oval Office. On Thursday,   Trump went to Ohio for a rally, as part of what is being billed as a “thank you tour” of states that he won in the election. Consider what Republicans would be saying if Hillary Clinton had won the electoral college, then proceeded to visit only the states that had supported her. They would say it showed what a hateful,    divider she was, caring only about the Americans that were already in her camp and doing nothing to reach out to the other side. Yet despite the fact that Trump lost the vote by over 2½ million votes, I’ve seen barely any appeals for him to reach across the aisle, not enact too ambitious an agenda, or try to understand the experiences and feelings of the 72 million (and counting) voters who didn’t want him to be their president. He certainly didn’t do that Thursday. As we’ve seen before, Trump had a somewhat conciliatory text written for him on the teleprompter, which had some words about the whole country coming together. And then, as he often does, he went on his own extemporaneous assault, lashing out at the news media, Republican Party leaders, his primary opponents,   protesters and, of course, Hillary Clinton  —   to which the crowd responded with that oldie but goodie, chants of “Lock her up!”  On the same day, Trump’s top aides were at Harvard for a public postmortem with officials from the Clinton campaign, which devolved into a shouting match. Trump’s campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, took deep offense at Clinton communication director Jennifer Palmieri’s suggestion that the Trump campaign became a platform for white supremacists. “Do you think I ran a campaign where white supremacists had a platform?” Conway asked incredulously. What a crazy notion, when the campaign’s CEO came from a white nationalist website, her candidate routinely retweeted white supremacist messages, and he was endorsed by the KKK. How could anyone have gotten that idea? But Conway’s key message was essentially the same as her boss’: Suck it up, losers. “Hashtag he’s your president. How’s that?” she said. “Will you ever accept the election results? Will you tell your protesters that he’s their president, too?” When it was over, Matthew Dowd, a strategist for George W. Bush, tweeted, “What we learned tonight from Trump’s speech and Trump campaign at Harvard is they have not an ounce of graciousness or humility amongst them. ”  So what does this portend for the Trump presidency? Does Trump have it in him to reach out beyond his core supporters? I think some of the keys to foreseeing the shape of his presidency lie in the lessons he took from his campaign. He got away with things like not releasing his tax returns, and that taught him that he can subvert and violate those kinds of norms without consequence. And he also learned something important about appealing only to his base. Most analysts  —   myself included  —   thought it would be impossible for him to find enough “missing” white votes to overcome the Democrats’ advantage among nonwhite and urban voters. We were wrong about that. His message of resentment, anger and fear turned out enough of those voters for him to move past Clinton in key Midwest states and win an electoral college victory  From that, Trump will almost surely take the lesson that he doesn’t need to reach out to anybody; he can win by appealing only to his rabid base. And that’s what he’s inclined to do anyway. As we know by now, Trump is uncommonly   and vindictive. He’ll never generously welcome in someone who has opposed him; if you were against him, the only way you can win back his favor is to engage in a public ritual of supplication and humiliation, as the likes of Chris Christie and Ted Cruz did  —   and that’s after he’s taken his revenge on you.  There’s no reason to believe Trump thinks any differently about the majority of voters who opposed him as he does about his vanquished rivals. If there’s one thing we should understand about Trump by now, it’s that he is who he has always been and he isn’t going to change. On a regular basis he’ll be reinforcing his supporters’ belief that people who didn’t vote for Trump are the enemy, and Democrats’ belief that the president is actively trying to vilify them and undermine their  . You can argue  —   and I have before  —   that it isn’t really within the president’s power to make us all come together as one (the only thing that really does is an external threat). But a president can certainly make the divisions in our country worse. How much worse? We’re about to find out.

142013,217360,"Democrats need to focus on the gut, not the head",Washington Post,Fareed Zakaria,2016-12-01,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161203001010/https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/democrats-need-to-focus-on-the-gut-not-the-head/2016/12/01/dfbe7782-b803-11e6-a677-b608fbb3aaf6_story.html
"," As Democrats contemplate their losses in November’s election, most have settled on a solution. They believe that the party needs more economically populist policies. But this misses an essential reality: Most people don’t vote on the basis of policies. There is excellent research by political scientists and psychologists on why people vote. The conclusion is clear. As Gabriel Lenz writes in his landmark 2012 book, “Follow the Leader?” “Voters don’t choose between politicians based on policy stances; rather, voters appear to adopt the policies that their favorite politicians prefer. ” And how do voters pick their favorite politicians? It is a gut decision that is more emotional than rational. Mostly it hinges on whether they identify with a politician in the social and psychological senses. In an important recent book, “Democracy for Realists,” Christopher Achen and Larry Bartels show that “group attachments” and “social identities” are key to understanding voting behavior. Psychologist Jonathan Haidt reinforces this view with mountains of research showing that people choose their political views based on their tribal attachments. The problem for the Democratic Party is not that its policies aren’t progressive or populist enough. They are already progressive and are substantially more populist than the Republican Party’s on almost every dimension. And yet, over the past decade, Republicans have swept through statehouses, governors’ mansions, Congress and now the White House. Democrats need to understand not just the Trump victory but that broader wave.     President Obama said during a news conference Monday that it’s ”healthy” for the Democratic Party to go through reflection. ”When your team loses, everyone gets deflated,” Obama said. (The Washington Post)   The Republican Party has been able to profit electorally at so many levels because it has found a way to emotionally identify with   whites as they watch their country get transformed. Globalization, automation and immigration all generate enormous social change. Republicans signal that at a gut level, they are uncomfortable with this change and like America the way it was. That is why states with older,   white voters, such as Ohio, Michigan and Wisconsin, all have Republican governors and statehouses. Partly this is a matter of policy (on guns, say) but mostly it is about identity and attachment, conveyed through symbols and signals. In a perceptive essay in the Harvard Business Review, Joan Williams explains that   people distrust and disdain professionals  —   and that the Democratic Party is now a party of professionals. These professionals, in this view, are overeducated urbanites with effete lifestyles (organic food, vegan diets, yoga) who have jobs that are about manipulating words and numbers. On the other hand, Williams notes,   people love the rich. They love, for example, a real estate developer from Queens who actually builds stuff, flaunts his wealth and retains all his basic appetites. When Donald Trump posts a photograph of himself in his plane eating Kentucky Fried Chicken, he is saying to his base, “I’m just like you, only with lots of money. ” And in fact, Trump in many ways is a   person’s fantasy of what his life would be like if he were rich, from the   triplex to the   fixtures in his plane.  If this emotional attachment is the key to getting people to vote for you, what does this mean for the Democratic Party? It has advantages. It begins with a strong base of people who do identify with it: professionals, working women, minorities, millennials. But it needs to reclaim a larger share of   whites. To do this, the Democrats need to understand the politics of symbolism. Hillary Clinton’s campaign, for instance, should have been centered around one simple theme: that she grew up in a town outside Chicago and lived in Arkansas for two decades. The subliminal message to   whites would have been “I know you. I am you. ” It was the theme of her husband’s speech introducing her at the Democratic convention, and Bill Clinton’s success has a lot to do with the fact that, brilliant as he is, he can always remind those voters that he knows them. Once reassured, they are then open to his policy ideas. Barack Obama is a singularly charismatic politician. But he might have made Democrats forget that the three Democrats elected to the White House before his election came from the rural South. They knew that world; they were of it. With these insights in mind, on the campaign trail, perhaps Clinton and the Democrats should have rallied not with Beyonce and Jay Z but rather with George Strait. And if you don’t know who he is, that’s part of the problem.  Read more from Fareed Zakaria’s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook.

"," It is a sign of how secretive the new administration plans to be that when Donald Trump spoke this week with the Pakistani prime minister, Americans learned what was discussed not from their   but from the oppressive Pakistani government’s Ministry of Information.  Luckily, ministry Press Release No. 298  —   Pakistan’s official “readout” of the phone call  —   so perfectly captured the  ’s way of speaking that there can be little doubt it is close to a verbatim account. It is 193 words of unintentional literary genius:  “Prime Minister Muhammad Nawaz Sharif called   USA Donald Trump and felicitated him on his victory. President Trump said Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif you have a very good reputation. You are a terrific guy. You are doing amazing work which is visible in every way. I am looking forward to see you soon. As I am talking to you Prime Minister, I feel I am talking to a person I have known for long. Your country is amazing with tremendous opportunities. Pakistanis are one of the most intelligent people. I am ready and willing to play any role that you want me to play to address and find solutions to the outstanding problems. It will be an honor and I will personally do it. Feel free to call me any time even before 20th January that is before I assume my office.  “On being invited to visit Pakistan by the Prime Minister, Mr. Trump said that he would love to come to a fantastic country, fantastic place of fantastic people. Please convey to the Pakistani people that they are amazing and all Pakistanis I have known are exceptional people, said Mr. Donald Trump. ”  What made Trump’s conversation with Sharif all the more terrific, amazing, tremendous, fantastic and exceptional was that only days earlier, a member of Trump’s transition team had told journalists in India that Trump is in favor of legislation declaring Pakistan a “terror state. ” The promise, consistent with Trump’s previous complaints about Pakistan’s “betrayal and disrespect,” was huge news on the subcontinent.     Vice   Mike Pence on Nov. 30 said senators and congressmen should “buckle up” for   Donald Trump’s legislative agenda. Pence and Trump’s chief of staff Reince Priebus were meeting with House Speaker Paul D. Ryan. (The Washington Post)   To summarize: Pakistan is a fantastic and exceptional state sponsor of terrorism! Sharif does amazing, tremendous work with terrorists! Terrific. I’m felicitated.  The contradictory messages to the   arch rivals tells us something about how Trump operates: He tells whoever is listening to him exactly what that person wants to hear. How else could he spend the entire campaign whipping up crowds in fear of a corrupt global elite led by Goldman Sachs  —   and then, after securing victory, stock his administration with Goldman Sachs bankers?  It’s tempting to wonder how our pleaser  ’s other conversations would be described if we got verbatim “readouts” in the style delivered by Pakistan’s Ministry of Information: Paul Ryan   USA Donald Trump said House Speaker Paul Ryan, as I am talking to you Speaker, I feel I am talking to a person I have known for long. Your proposal to privatize Medicare is amazing, with tremendous opportunities. I am ready and willing to play any role that you want me to play.  Nancy Pelosi Donald Trump felicitated Nancy Pelosi on her victory in Democratic caucus election. You are doing amazing work to stop Medicare from being privatized, which is visible in every way.

And with none of the problems of previous Cabinets. And without any ties to plutocrats or the grotesque handful of corporations, like Goldman Sachs, that are squeezing the life out of the American people. You will not let the American people down! 1. Surreptitiously Google “What is a Cabinet?” 2. The first thing that comes up is some sort of rap battle from that cursed musical “Hamilton. ” 3. Okay. This is fine. You can do this. 4. FIFTEEN DEPARTMENTS? 5. If you had only known you would have had more children. 6. Okay, you had better write these departments down. Where is a pen? 7. “How is the Cabinet coming?” Melania Trump asks. “Fine,” you say, holding up a pen. “Huge progress. ” 8. Mitt Romney has called you eight times. You wonder why. 9. “The Cabinet,” you read online, “includes the Vice President and the heads of 15 executive departments  —   the Secretaries of Agriculture, Commerce, Defense, Education, Energy, Health and Human Services, Homeland Security, Housing and Urban Development, Interior, Labor, State, Transportation, Treasury and Veterans Affairs, as well as the Attorney General. ” This is too many. No. 10. Sit with your head in your hands in an attitude of desperation until Ivanka Trump comes in. Tweet something ambiguous about your mental state. Members of the press take it literally and worry that you are coming for them. 11. If America were a dictatorship, would you still need to do all this? Probably you would need to do more. Ugh. Why can’t America be like England where boring people get to yell at each other about policy and one person gets to wear ermine and sashay elegantly around touching babies and having diamond jubilees? 12. Maybe there is a reality TV show about Cabinets. Spend the next six hours surfing cable trying to find one. 13. “DUCK DYNASTY” IS RIVETING! WHERE HAS THIS SHOW BEEN ALL YOUR LIFE? 14. “How is the Cabinet coming?” Reince Priebus asks. 15. “Great. ” 16. “Any names in particular spring to mind?” Priebus asks. You glance helplessly around the room. There is a menu from the Trump Grill and a bill for hair restoration. “Price,” you say, hopelessly. “Chow. ” He keeps staring at you hopefully. “Jeff,” you say. There is probably someone in the world named Jeff. 17. “Tom Price?” Priebus asks. “Elaine Chao? Jeff   …     Sessions?” 18. “Yes, obviously. ” 19. Squint down at the list, and pick three departments at random. “Health and Human Services, Transportation and attorney general. ” 20. Priebus shrugs. “Sure,” he says. “Why not?” 21. You nod. “Any thoughts for secretary of state?” Priebus asks. 22. “I am thinking,” you say, after a long pause, “phone. ” 23. The phone rings. Mitt Romney! You are saved, kind of. Eegh, Mitt Romney. Maybe Kellyanne Conway can go on TV and say this is a bad idea. 24. “How about national security adviser?” Priebus asks. 25. That’s not on this list at all. That sounds  . You are out of words. “Flin,” you say, after a long pause. Oh no, that’s not a word at all! 26. “Mike Flynn?” Priebus asks. 27. “Yes,” you say quickly. “Of course. Him. ” 28. “Are there other surprise people I do not know whom I will need?” you ask President Obama, when he next calls. 29. “Surprise people?” Obama asks. He sounds a little stunned. “You mean important presidential appointments who don’t come up when you Google ‘Cabinet,’ like the U. N. ambassador or CIA director?” If you paid attention to these things, you would detect a certain strain in his voice. “You didn’t just Google this, did you?” 30. “Of course not,” you say, grumpily. You write those down in Sharpie and hang up. 31. This is very stressful. You have earned a taco bowl. While you wait for it, write down the names of every person you have ever met, organized from Most Rich to Least Rich. 32. Draw lines connecting them to your list of jobs at random. Hooray, Betsy DeVos is now education secretary! Wilbur Ross can be commerce secretary! This is like a crossword puzzle, but much easier. 33. Treasury. You know you promised the American people something about the Treasury and Goldman Sachs, but you can’t remember what. 34. Just in case, appoint a former Goldman Sachs executive secretary of the treasury. Okay, great. Progress. 35. See? You can do this. You can do anything. All you have to do is believe. That is how you were elected president. You should remember that. 36. Your taco bowl arrives. 37. As you eat, some of it spills on the name “James Mattis. ” Smile ear to ear. 38. This will not be so hard after all."

","         The job of a president’s national security adviser often resembles the challenge of jaywalking across an   boulevard without being run over. The jockeying among Cabinet members, the grinding interagency process, the traps and manholes that arise, not to mention crisis management, are enough to fray the nerves of even the steeliest aide. President Carter’s national security adviser, Zbigniew Brzezinski, was awakened at home just after 2:26 a. m. on June 3, 1980. He was told that two intercontinental ballistic missiles were headed toward the United States. After the first signals, the displays showed even more missiles coming. After three minutes, the alert was ended  —   a false alarm, caused by the failure of a computer chip, but for those minutes, all too real. If the adrenaline rush is not enough, imagine the headaches in sorting out feuds between the secretaries of state and defense, as happened under President Ronald Reagan in the 1980s. He went through six national security advisers in eight years. President Trump’s choice for the job seems confident that everything will come up roses. Retired Lt. Gen. Mike Flynn tweeted Thursday night: We are going to win and win and win at everything we do. It is going to be tough, but Team   will #MAGA 🇺🇸🍀🏄  —   General Flynn (@GenFlynn) December 2, 2016  It is a shame to dampen his enthusiasm, but the world does not work this way. To predict victory at everything is to be disconnected from reality. The national security adviser is supposed to be the one who connects the president to reality. What Flynn offers  —   and what Donald Trump has promoted all year  —   is a magic elixir, a lovely vacation from all troubles. One may dismiss Trump’s boasts as political slogans, but does Flynn, the man who will get the call in the middle of the night, actually believe his own irrational exuberance? Let’s imagine his first day in the West Wing. An aide delivers to the national security adviser some bad news: Hackers have infiltrated the personnel files of the U. S. government and stolen the personal information of 4. 2 million former and current government employees, and they’ve grabbed sensitive security clearance background information on 21 million people. Also, the fingerprint data of 5. 6 million people was stolen. Some of them are U. S. intelligence and law enforcement officers in the field. The private information could be harmful in the wrong hands. The files are gone, it is too late to stop the thieves and they did not leave an address. This actually happened not too long ago at the Office of Personnel Management, in what is certainly one of the worst cyberattacks ever on the U. S. government. How do you “win and win and win at everything” when you can’t even identify who the enemy is? This is the reality of shadowy and vexing cyberconflict that has been intensifying in recent years  —   perpetrators sneaking up at network speed, nearly impossible to identify, a war that can be entirely asymmetric, meaning that the little guys can win, win and win again. Shall we move on to Day Two?              Caption     Donald Trump faces a challenge as he prepares for his move to the White House: selecting the men and women who will fill his administration.

","         If they ever remake that 1958 classic “The Fly,” Mitt Romney should play the fly and Donald Trump the spider that comes to eat him. “Help me, help me,” the fly cries as the spider moves in for the kill. Only in real life, nothing can help Romney. Instead of being a creature with the head of a man and the body of a fly, he has the head of a man and the quivering body of a jellyfish. It’s a different movie, I grant you  —   but still horrible to watch. Once, Romney was all man. He was the governor of Massachusetts  —   a progressive state  —     of a sizable financial firm, and then Republican nominee for president. I did not vote for him, but I always thought he’d make a passable president  —   he certainly looked the part. This time around, he was just about the only Republican to stay out of the presidential race, meaning that he did not have to suffer the ignominy of losing to Donald Trump. Trump was the worst possible choice: a flamboyant ignoramus  —   narcissistic and cruel as they all are  —   and a bully and a cheat and a liar, with bad hair to boot.  During the 2016 campaign, Romney rose to the occasion. He denounced Trump as a “phony” and a “fraud. ” He called his promises “worthless,” said he tolerated bigotry and suggested that Trump University lacked more than a football team. In fact, Romney devoted a whole speech to a denunciation of Trump. It was, as Winston Churchill said in a somewhat different context, his “finest hour. ” It was, however, an hour that lasted a New York minute. In fact, it was to that very city that Romney came hat in hand. He wants to be Trump’s secretary of state. Trump has heard him out  —   twice. Romney has been out to Trump’s golf course for a meeting and then joined Trump and the flexible Reince Priebus for a dinner the other night at   restaurant. It is a swell place in Trump International Hotel & Tower New York on the West Side, known for French food. That night, however, crow must have been on the menu. It’s possible that Trump may yet pick Romney. Abraham Lincoln famously put together a “team of rivals” for his Cabinet, but if I may go out on a limb here, Trump is no Lincoln. Instead, he’s a blowhard who is not likely to have increased his respect for Romney by watching him grovel. The performance, I might add, has surely been noticed by foreign governments, with whom a Secretary of State Romney would be dealing. They now know that a breakfast meeting with him would mean two bowls of mush. His word would mean nothing. He would be, as Vyacheslav Molotov was to Joseph Stalin, a   errand boy who would have to prove his loyalty over and over again.  Trump has proved to be minimally useful, offering a kind of litmus test for character. There are those who stand up to him and those who grovel. Romney is in the latter camp, proving  —   if nothing else  —   that he would have made a weak president. He is not a man’s head on the body of a fly. He is a man’s head on the body of a puppy. Beg, Mitt. Roll over, Mitt. Aw, Mitt, look what you’ve done! Bad Mitt."

","        IRONDALE, Ala.  —   They have put it off all spring and summer, but now it’s autumn and they’re out of excuses, so they set out on what should be the most ordinary of chores: to dismantle a trampoline in one back yard and rebuild it in another.  “I love you,” the    boy says as they drive through their neighborhood, just after his mother, who awoke with another migraine, told him to “shut up and sit on your butt or else. ” “I love you,” he says again, a few seconds later, for what seems like the 10th time today, and now no one says anything. His grandmother stares ahead, dreading where they’re going. The truck pulls up to a   home where, seven months before, a    named Kimi Reylander was accidentally shot to death. The family gets out: Kimi’s mother, her grandmother and, finally, her little brother. In front of them, in Kimi’s  ’s house, is the bedroom where Kimi died from “a perforating gunshot wound to the head,” according to the autopsy report, and also where, in that instant, the others began a new life defined not only by their suddenly changed relationships with one another but also their suddenly complicated relationships with guns. Joel Watson, the   who left out the gun. Tina Watson, the grandmother who didn’t see the gun. Amanda Watson, the mother whose son reached for the gun. Jaxon, who pulled the trigger. In a nation where nearly 4 percent of shootings are unintentional and, in a given week, two children die from accidental shootings, according to gun violence research, what happened to Kimi’s family has occurred at least 25 times since January 2015. A child gets hold of a gun and accidentally kills a sibling, and a family is left trying to figure out how to recover. In De Queen, Ark. where a    boy shot and killed his    brother, one family looked for recovery at church. Another family in Vista, Calif. looked for it in the criminal justice system after a    boy shot and killed his    brother. In the District, after a    boy shot and killed his    sister, another family sought it in counseling services. And now a family in Irondale is trying to find it, or at least its beginnings, by taking the trampoline from the house where Kimi used to play on it to the house where Jaxon, they hope, might. “You going to come here and give me a hug?” Joel, inside on the couch, asks his  . “I’m not going in,” Tina says quietly. “Let’s go take the trampoline down,” Amanda, 27, says. Out back is a trampoline covered in leaves and dust. A swimming pool that Kimi used with friends has a film of green on the bottom and leaves floating on the top. “Pool ready now?” Jaxon asks. “No, baby,” Tina says. “Y’all got that thing loaded that quick?” Joel asks a few minutes later, after the trampoline has been dismantled and put on the truck’s trailer. “Yeah,” Tina says. “So fast,” he says and watches them leave with the trampoline.  ***    Amanda Watson smokes a cigarette and cries while pleading with a local TV station to take her daughter’s picture off an online story about gun safety. (Linda   Washington Post)  This is how a mother loses her child: It was Feb. 6, a Saturday. Amanda was exhausted from another week of work. Jaxon, then 3, was with Tina, and Kimi was at Joel’s house. It was a good day for Amanda. She and her boyfriend had started talking about marrying. She believed, after having two kids before 24, that she was finally getting good at being a parent. Then the phone rang, and a relative was saying, “Kimi’s been shot,” and someone else was saying, “Baby, it’s bad,” and now it’s seven months later, and she’s sitting on her bedroom floor, holding her head in her hands. “Do you have any Tylenol?” she asks her boyfriend. “Freaking migraines, so damned debilitating, freaking sucks. ” She swallows a pill and lifts her head. She wants to get out of this house, where some days it seems everything reminds her of Kimi. The calendar she uses to count the days since Kimi’s death. The kitchen chair where Kimi ate dinner. Kimi’s bedroom, now dark and stripped of furniture. Jaxon is with a relative for the morning, so she and her boyfriend go for a drive. She plugs her phone into the car’s stereo, puts on a hard rock song and sets down the phone, reaching past a bottle of sleeping pills the doctor gave her because of the dreams she’d been having of Kimi  —   Amanda saying to her, “You’re dead,” and Kimi saying, “No, I’m not. I’m right here. ” The pills were supposed to help with nights, but what about the days? Just that morning, she had yelled at Jaxon again when she caught him throwing away his breakfast, and he began to cry. “No,” she said. “You’re not going to do that. ” He continued to cry. “Shut your mouth, or I’ll whip you,” she said. “But I want ice cream,” he said. “Shut your mouth,” she said again, glaring at him. She knew how she sounded. She didn’t used to snap like this. Now she feels combustible  —   “busting at the seams,” as Tina puts it  —   and how does she get past all of this anger? She has told herself countless times that it wasn’t Jaxon’s fault. He’s just a little boy. He said he thought the gun was a toy. But every day she has to work at not being upset at him. “I know this sounds horrible, but do you know how hard it is not to have ill feelings toward a kid? How hard it is not to be upset at Jaxon? Do you know how hard it is?” she had asked the night before. “I have no one to blame. I can’t blame my kid. I can’t blame God because it’s inappropriate. I have nobody to blame. I have no outlet as far as taking out my anger, so I use my family and my fiance as a punching bag. ” In the car now, she turns the volume up so loud that conversation with her boyfriend becomes impossible. She grips the wheel tightly, looks straight ahead and mouths the words of a song as she steers a car that has, among other things, a loaded gun in the glove box. It’s a 9mm  —   the same caliber that killed Kimi  —   but while her anger bothers her, guns don’t. She doesn’t feel nervous around that gun or any other gun. She’s more scared of not having one. She still has a child to raise, and what if there’s an intruder, and that intruder has a gun, and she doesn’t? How would she recover from that? How could she live knowing she could have protected Jaxon but had decided she was too afraid to have a gun? Her boyfriend reaches for the car stereo and turns the music down. “Is that loud enough for you?” he asks. She ignores the question. She flips through a few songs and decides on another heavy metal one. She turns it back up and continues to drive. It wasn’t the gun’s fault Kimi died, she tells herself. A car wreck could have just as easily killed her. Or a bad fall. Kimi’s death, she has come to believe, was a random accident. So after the burial, after child services searched the house to ensure that every gun was secure, after reading online comments calling for her prosecution and Jaxon’s removal, Amanda had no hesitation about going shooting again. She hoisted a long .  pistol with a scope that day, took a photograph of herself   and made it her profile picture on Facebook. “I’m pretty badass,” she wrote after posting the photo. “I feel for the person who even thinks about messing with MY child. ” Six weeks after that, she went with Joel to her first marksmanship competition, outshot him, posted a video about it to Facebook and tagged Tina, who she thinks would feel better, too, if she went shooting. Maybe then Tina wouldn’t get upset whenever she sees Amanda’s gun. “Ready to go now?” her boyfriend asks. She looks at the time. Jaxon will be back soon. But not yet. “I’m not in that big of a hurry to go home,” she says, lighting another cigarette. Only when she’s sure Jaxon will be back does she begin driving toward the house, and now, pulling into the driveway, she sees Jaxon running toward her. She wants to one day teach him about guns, as she was taught herself, so he can protect himself. But for now, whenever he goes inside the car, she opens the glove box, removes the 9mm, ejects the clip, clears the chamber and places the disassembled parts out of reach. He’s not getting inside now, so there’s one last thing to do. She locks all the doors. Then she follows Jaxon into the house, sits on her bedroom floor, begins to cry and hopes he can’t hear. ***    Tina Watson sometimes watches a taped news report about the shooting to remember Kimi and as a way to help Jaxon understand what happened. (Linda   Washington Post)  Tina, the grandmother who didn’t see the gun, drives home in silence after a morning shift at the bank. Today is Saturday, and Saturday is when she cleans the house she shares with Amanda, Jaxon and her husband, just down the road from where Joel, her    lives. She cleans every room, even the one that now makes her most anxious, the bedroom where her husband keeps his guns. “Let me take a minute,” she says, sitting on the front porch with a sweet tea and a cigarette, and then another. “Oh me,” she sighs. “Oh me, oh me. ” She has spent her entire life around guns, and in those first weeks after Kimi’s death, when she found herself afraid of guns for the first time, she thought she was still in shock, that it wasn’t the guns, it was her. She just needed more time. Guns were all over her childhood home  —   guns for hunting, guns for protection  —   and she learned how to shoot at a young age. When she was 19, she married a man who had been raised the same way, and both of her daughters grew up knowing guns, too. Guns were so ordinary she rarely gave them much thought. Now, at 53, she’s always thinking about them. The gun her husband carries, the gun Amanda carries, and, most of all, the gun she didn’t see. She finishes her cigarette, exhales slowly and stamps it out. “I’m ready to get at it,” she says. She collects a bucket of cleaning materials and walks to the other end of the house. She had always been happy here. She raised four kids in this house  —   two kids, two grandkids  —   and though she hates the shaggy green carpet, the unfinished cabinets, the faded furniture, she only started considering leaving after Kimi died, when she realized that the guns were staying and that she was the only one who thought they shouldn’t. The bedroom is a mess. The bed is unmade. Pillows are strewn across the floor. She starts with the dresser. She reaches up and swabs the duster across the surface. On top is where her husband puts his .  pistol every night when preparing for bed, and it’s where she goes every morning to make sure it’s there and hasn’t been left out where Jaxon could reach it. Her husband tells her she shouldn’t worry. He’s always careful with his guns. What happened at Joel’s won’t happen here. She wants to believe him, even when she saw a pistol in the driver’s side door while they drove home the other day.    Tina cries while thinking about Kimi. After she was shot, Tina cradled her until paramedics arrived. (Linda   Washington Post)  “That gun in that door in that truck,” she said to him after they came inside. “What about it?” he asked. “If you’re walking up to the truck and you’re looking inside the truck and Jaxon is behind you, what do you do if he grabs that thing?” “If he’s behind me?” “You know he follows you all the time,” she said. “You don’t think he can reach past you?” “Not without me knowing. ” “Oh, okay,” she said sarcastically with a laugh. “I mean it bothered me is what I’m saying. ” She now unrolls some paper towel, sprays Pledge on the dresser and buffs it. Is she the crazy one? Or are they? Is it that they didn’t see what she saw? She gets down on her hands and knees. “I don’t see how this place gets so dusty,” she says and moves on to another dresser, where she finds one of Kimi’s tubes of lip gloss. She picks it up, puts it down. She would like to picture Kimi using it in front of her bathroom mirror as she used to, but all she sees is that day: going over to Joel’s house to help do his bills. Kimi watching a show on her iPad on the floor and Jaxon going up on the bed so he could see better. Leaving the room, hearing a pop and thinking it was a balloon. Then the blood and the smell and cradling Kimi until the paramedics arrived, some of whom looked at Tina as if she were to blame. Her thinking she was.  Now she stands before the gun safe. Last week, when she was at a low point, sick of feeling this way and wanting a release, she opened it up, looked at the guns and thought how easy it would be. But the family didn’t need another dead person, so she closed it and went outside to her porch and cigarettes. She dusts the safe, plugs in the lock’s code, opens it and looks inside. She sees seven pistols hanging against the door: the Taurus . 40 caliber, the Kimber 1911, the Beretta 9mm, the . 45 ACP, the . 357 magnum, the . 380, the . 22. She sees five long guns  —   one .  rifle, four shotguns  —   leaning against a corner. She sees boxes and boxes of ammunition, red and green shotgun shells, magazines in leather sleeves. How could she not have seen the gun that day? How could she have been that negligent? She stares at the 12 guns. Could one of them kill Jaxon next? “There are millions of ways that he could die,” Amanda told her the other day when Tina started again with those questions. “Why is a gun any different?” “Being in that room with Kimi and having to hold her for 20 minutes is what made the difference,” Tina said. “It could be anything,” Amanda said. “It could be. ” “Just because it happened to Kimi doesn’t mean it’s going to happen to Jaxon. ” “It doesn’t mean it won’t,” Tina said. Amanda walked out of the room. “I just don’t know. I’ve been trying to put the pieces together for months,” Tina said to herself, and then, after Amanda returned, to her, “You can’t ever say that Jaxon killed his sissy. Because he didn’t. ” “But he did,” Amanda said. “The gun did!” Tina said. “And the negligence of leaving that gun down is what caused that gun to kill Kimi. ” Tina now takes one more look at the guns. More and more, she is feeling like a hypocrite for staying in a house with so many. But unwilling to leave the only man she has ever loved, she closes and locks the gun safe and, without cleaning it, goes on to the next room. ***     Tina, center, visits with her    Joel Watson, and his wife, Joan. Kimi was shot and killed in their home, down the road from where she lived with her mother, grandmother and little brother. (Linda   Washington Post)  Joel, the   who left the gun out, lives at the base of a small hill in a quiet   house. “It’s always quiet here,” he says one afternoon, just as a faint sound filters in from outside. He cranes his neck and looks outside. “Did you hear that?” he asks and, seeing it’s only a neighbor, leans back again into the couch. There are so many things he could be doing. The pool and garage need cleaning. He has a treadmill he doesn’t use. And a work shed where he has assembled thousands of bullets and where he would like to assemble thousands more. He loves guns so much he sometimes falls asleep thinking of them. But then it’s morning again, and he’s walking past the room where it happened, past all the pictures of Kimi, and sitting on the couch where the thoughts start over again. Was the trigger defective? How much pressure did it take to pull it? How could a little boy have fired a 9mm pistol? “I’ve been thinking about it and thinking about it,” he says. “I can’t get no peace about it. ” The idea that Jaxon was somehow able to pull that trigger is just about the last mystery guns have for him. He’s been shooting since he was 6, when he lived in a country shack whose floorboards barely hid the ground and his father gave him a pellet gun. In the time since, he has shot nearly every gun he can think of. He has won marksmanship championships. He has taken guns apart and put them back together again. There are guns in his bedroom, living room, kitchen, stairwell and basement, where he keeps a large safe stocked with guns and a closet filled with disassembled gun parts. When he worked as a painter or did drywall, he would think about retirement and see days tinkering with and shooting guns.      Joel, Kimi’s   is a lifelong gun enthusiast who taught Kimi about firearms as he did his sons. (Linda   Washington Post)     Joel gets teary in the spare bedroom where Kimi was shot. After her death, he wondered how a toddler could have pulled the gun’s trigger. (Linda   Washington Post)     And then Kimi. He never had a daughter. She came over so much that he set up the spare room as her playroom and taught her the same way he did his two boys and his father taught him. He took her hunting. He brought her inside his gun workshop. When she picked up the pink .  rifle he gave her when she was 6, he told her not to touch the trigger, and she never did. He never worried something would happen because it never had before. Even in 2010, when a . 25 pistol toppled off a bedroom closet shelf, hit the floor and went off, the bullet grazing his wife’s arm and narrowly missing Kimi, he dismissed it as a freak accident. “We just put it right back up there in the closet,” he says. Every night Kimi stayed over, she would help him get ready for bed. He took the spare bedroom while she stayed in the master bedroom with his wife, and she would bring in his glass of water, eye drops and loaded 9mm, which he slept beside. He’d watch her carry it in, gripping it by a mounted light, satisfied that she knew not to touch the trigger. In the mornings, he or Kimi would take it back to his bedroom again. The morning of Feb. 6, he awoke beside the gun in the spare bedroom, thinking about a marksmanship competition he had that day. He passed Kimi watching cartoons in the living room and eating cereal. He went to the basement and placed a rifle and two pistols inside his traveling case, kissed Kimi and his wife goodbye, drove 20 miles to Hoover Tactical Firearms, won one of three matches, came home, noticed Tina’s car in the driveway, opened his car door and saw one of his sons running outside. “Kimi got shot. ” “Lord, no,” Joel said. He went upstairs and lay down on the floor beside Tina cradling her and grabbed something  —   a rag? a towel?  —   and pressed it against Kimi’s head. “Don’t let it kill her,” he would remember saying. “Don’t let her die. Lord, I’ll do anything. ” After he told investigators that he hadn’t known Jaxon would be over that day, and it became clear he wouldn’t be charged, he went to the station to retrieve the gun. He wanted to ask the detective who had interviewed him about the trigger. Then he wanted to sell the gun he had never fired and now never wanted to for whatever price the gun shop offered. But the detective wasn’t in, and Joel hasn’t been back. Seven months later, Joel, 75, is sitting in the living room, thinking about a different 9mm. It’s the one he has used for protection since Kimi’s death, but it stays out of sight, inside a bedroom drawer and atop a folded white towel. He thinks about a day he took it out and shot it years ago. It kicked like a mule. He shot it again. The trigger needed a lot of pressure. He shot it again and again, eight times in all. How was Jaxon able to pull that trigger? A little later, he looks at his wife, who’s bedridden with arthritis and whom he watches all day. She’s staring out the window at a hummingbird. “I want to go talk to him,” he says of the detective. “You don’t even want that gun back, do you?” his wife says. “No,” he says, shaking his head. “But I just thought about it. I had it in my mind. This is what I was thinking. ” She doesn’t say anything and looks back outside at the hummingbird, and he goes back to thinking about the trigger. ***      Jaxon lines his toys up in rows at home. What happened to him and his family has occurred at least 25 times across the United States since January 2015. (Linda   Washington Post)  Jaxon, the boy who pulled the trigger, watches a yellow school bus drive by. “Why isn’t it taking Sissy?” he asks. “You know why it isn’t,” says Tina, sitting on the porch with another glass of sweet tea. He says something, but it comes out unintelligible. “Come here,” Tina says. “I don’t understand what you’re saying. ” “I’m going to make Sissy come home,” he says. “You can’t make Sissy come home,” she says. Tina starts to cry, and Jaxon screams. He whacks both palms against his head twice, throws open the front door and slams it shut. He goes to his bedroom and sits at a small table covered with puzzle pieces. A cartoon plays on the television. Alone, he tries to fit some pieces together but quickly stops. “Where’s Mommy?” he asks and goes to Amanda’s room, where she is sitting on the floor with the lights turned off. “Out,” Amanda says. “Out for a minute. ” “But why?” he asks. “Jaxon, just get out for a minute. ” He starts to cry and walks into her room anyway, and Amanda hugs and kisses him and sends him out, where he sees Tina walking up to the doorway. “I know you’re upset,” she tells Amanda. “And he is, too. And he needs to know you’re okay. ” “I just told him that I was okay,” Amanda says. “I just gave him a hug. I just gave him a kiss. And now I just need a minute. ” “When is Mommy going to come out?” Jaxon asks. Tina takes him out to the front porch, where they sit, and he asks, “Why is Mommy sad?” “She’s sad over Sissy, baby. The same reason you were sad just a minute ago. You know we talked about this, right?” she says. “It may be a long time before Mommy feels better. ” “Sissy,” he says. “Long, long, long, long time. ” “Baby, Sissy is not going to feel better,” she says. “We talked about this. ” “Not at all?” “No. ” “But why?” “You tell me. ” Jaxon doesn’t say anything. He keeps looking at Tina. “Why is Sissy not going to feel better?” she asks. “Tell me why,” he says. “Because Sissy died. ” “Sissy don’t live here anymore?” “No, Sissy died. ” “Sissy live over there?” he asks, pointing at a nearby house. “Sissy died. ” “But why did Sissy die?” Tina is quiet for a moment. She sighs. “It was an accident, baby,” she says.    ***      Photos of Kimi adorn the end tables in Joel’s home. (Linda   Washington Post)   Kimi, the girl who died by accident, was 9 years old and had “unremarkable” blue eyes, according to the autopsy report. She had unremarkable ears. The soles of her feet were unremarkable. Her nose, neck, tongue, lungs and heart were unremarkable. Her body carried no “significant trauma or natural disease. ” She was 55. 5 inches tall and weighed 85 pounds, and when the gun went off, she was wearing a green elastic hair tie. The bullet struck the right side of her head and made an   wound 1. 4 inches wide. It passed through the right cerebral hemisphere and the cortical ribbon, caused an “extensive hemorrhage” and exited 2. 7 inches below the top of her head. Three days later, police tested the gun’s trigger three times with a bench vice. It had a 6.  pull  —   about average. Two weeks after that, following interviews with Tina, Joel and Jaxon and a review of research that said   of   and    can pull a   trigger, police closed the case. They sent a form to the family distilling the investigation into one word: accident. And now, on an autumn afternoon, Joel is in his living room, amid his guns, watching television; Tina is down the road, sitting alone on her porch, lighting a cigarette; and Amanda has her phone in her hands, looking at a picture of Kimi. She scrolls through her Facebook feed and clicks on a page she follows called “Daily Attitude Adjustment. ” She sees a post about grief, shares it without comment and glances up to see Jaxon. He’s climbing a small ladder up onto the trampoline.  Rebuilding it had been quick, silent and joyless. At one point, Tina quietly cried. At another, Jaxon asked, “Where are you going, Mommy?” when Amanda walked toward the house for water. At another, Tina asked Jaxon, “Whose trampoline was that?” and he didn’t know. She said, “It was Sissy’s,” and he said, “It’s mine now. ” Now, up on his trampoline for the first time, he turns, sees Amanda and calls out, “I love you, Mommy. ” There it is again. “I love you,” she says this time and watches him teeter on the trampoline’s edge. “Get back in there or sit down,” she yells. Alone, he begins to jump, and Amanda watches the son she loves, who killed the daughter she loved. Then she puts down the phone with the picture of Kimi, walks over and climbs onto the trampoline. She lies down in the middle. She folds her hands together. Jaxon lies down beside her. They’re quiet for a while. He rests his head against her chest.     Tina can’t bring herself to clean Kimi’s handprints off the shower after her granddaughter’s death. (Linda   Washington Post)  "

","   Billionaire philanthropist David Rubenstein has agreed to fund an overhaul of the Washington Monument’s broken elevator system, but the beleaguered landmark will probably remain closed for the next 2    years, the National Park Service says.  It is the second time that Rubenstein has come to the aid of the monument, which has been shuttered since Aug. 17 because of chronic elevator problems. After the 2011 earthquake, he donated $7. 5 million of the $15 million cost of repairing the    obelisk.  But there is no start date for the roughly   elevator project, which will cost $2 million to $3 million, because the Park Service is awaiting funds for a new security screening entrance that it wants to build at the same time. And even if those funds come through, the Park Service does not see the monument reopening until the “cherry blossom season in 2019,” a spokesman, Mike Litterst, said in an email. “It does seem like it’s a long period of time,” said Will Shafroth, president of the National Park Foundation, the charitable partner that is facilitating Rubenstein’s donation. “Just know that the Park Service is moving as fast as it can. ” “As frustrating as it can be, they’re a federal agency,” he said. “We’re talking about one of our national monuments . . . A lot of people have a say in it, and it tends to grind the process a little bit slower than we’d like. ” The centerpiece of the Mall, the monument had just reopened two years ago after an almost   shutdown after the earthquake. Normally entered by about 500, 000 visitors a year, the   icon is a hallowed symbol of the United States and of Washington. “It’s the first thing people see when they come to the city,” said Sean Kennealy, chief of the professional services division for the Park Service’s National Mall and Memorial Parks.  Construction began in 1848. It was dedicated in 1885 and honors George Washington, a Revolutionary War hero and the nation’s first president. The Park Service says the elevator, which carries visitors to an observation level where the views are spectacular, is too unreliable to resume operations. It broke down numerous times in recent months, stranding groups of visitors and staff on board or at upper levels, and requiring calls to the D. C. fire department. Rubenstein is a founder of the Carlyle Group, a   global private equity firm, and has been a major benefactor of historic sites and institutions across the region. This year, he announced an $18. 5 million donation to help renovate the Lincoln Memorial. Last year, he pledged a $5. 37 million donation to refurbish the U. S. Marine Corps War Memorial near Arlington National Cemetery. In 2014, he gave $10 million to Montpelier, the historic Orange, Va. home of James Madison; $5 million to the White House Visitor Center; and $12. 3 million to Arlington House, the home of Robert E. Lee. He said his goal after the earthquake was to get the monument reopened to the public as soon as possible, and the goal is the same now. “The thing to do is to make the place as hospitable as possible and as safe as possible,” he said. “It’s a monument that’s going to be around for another 100, 200, 300 years, who knows how long. ” “Obviously, like everybody, I wish it was ready tomorrow,” he said. “But that’s not realistic. I want to make sure it’s done right, and if that’s what they say it takes, that’s what it takes. ” As for the elevator, “It was a very difficult decision to say that we need to close . . . until we can completely modernize this,” said Gay E. Vietzke, superintendent of the National Mall and Memorial Parks. “But we really felt that we owed the public a positive, seamless experience,” she said. “And we were at a place where we couldn’t offer that. ” She called it “ an unpredictable situation. ” “Say you’re [stuck] in the cab . . . and you have 30 or 40 minutes to wait” for emergency crews, Vietzke said. “And you’re claustrophobic, or someone’s sick, or has a condition. ” The elevator problems came just as the Park Service was about to launch an   $9 million project to build the permanent security screening facility. The present facility is temporary. That project, which also would require closing the monument, is awaiting government funding, Vietzke said. The Park Service wants to proceed with the two projects simultaneously, so it can save money and avoid one shutdown, followed by another one. “We want to try to do all the construction at the same time to minimize the period that we’re closed to the public,” she said. “There’s a scenario where we could do the elevator, and then have the money for the [security] building come, and have to do that, and it would be a much longer closure period,” she said. But it is unclear when the funding request, now before Congress, might be approved. Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton ( . C.) the city’s nonvoting member of Congress, said in a statement that she would work “to help secure the funding . . . so that the dual projects can take place at the same time . . . [and get] the monument to reopen as soon as possible. ” The Park Service said the new facility will feature ballistic glass and screening equipment and will be able to handle 20 to 25 visitors at a time. Kennealy said the monument may have the most heavily used elevator in Washington. “Our elevator runs, during the summer months . . . 13 hours a day, nonstop,” he said. “It doesn’t rest. . . . This thing is running constantly, the motor, the gears, the control system, the doors. ” The monument has had an elevator since it opened. The first was   and took 12 minutes to reach the top. The trip now takes 70 seconds. The Park Service wants to replace the elevator’s   computer controls, the door systems, cab lighting and ventilation, and cables, and study the idea of a cab that does not need a park ranger onboard. The powerful electric motor, which dates to the 1960s, is “a beast,” Kennealy said, and only needs refurbishing. The situation “is a drag, at this moment,” said Brian D. Joyner, chief of staff for the National Mall and Memorial Parks. “But it will be better. ”  Kelsey Snell contributed to this report. "

","     A year after the terrorist attack in San Bernardino, Calif. that killed 14 people and wounded 22 others, authorities are still probing the shooting and trying to answer lingering questions about what happened. Since the rampage, the FBI has waged a   fight with Apple over accessing a phone used by one of the terrorists, pleaded with the public for information and charged people related to the shooters with other crimes unearthed during the investigation. But a year after one of the deadliest attacks in the United States since Sept. 11, 2001, the FBI is still trying to determine whether anyone helped the attackers and hoping to figure out what the couple did during a mysterious period of time before dying in a shootout with police. On the morning of Dec. 2, 2015, workers with San Bernardino County’s health department were gathered for a training session when Syed Rizwan Farook, one of the employees, left and returned with his wife, Tashfeen Malik. The pair began shooting at Farook’s   ultimately firing more than 100 rounds before fleeing, according to a report released by the Justice Department. Four hours later, police tracked the couple down and killed them during a frenzied gun battle on a residential street.  The FBI said it was investigating the shooting as an act of terrorism after it emerged that Malik had posted a pledge of allegiance on Facebook to the leader of the Islamic State, a message made on behalf of both attackers. Authorities say both were radicalized for some time before the attack, although investigators said they do not think Malik and Farook were directly guided by a foreign terrorist group. “The brutality of the attack’s perpetrators could not have been in starker contrast to the selflessness and generosity that characterized those taken from us,” the White House said in a statement marking the anniversary Friday and honoring the victims of the attack. Using another acronym for the Islamic State, the message continued: “In the year since this tragedy, we have mourned those we lost, just as we have continued to confront the violent ideology behind this attack as well as the terrorist groups, including ISIL, that propagate it. ” In a new interview broadcast this week, the police chief in San Bernardino said authorities believe that the specifics of the attack  —   targeting that particular gathering at that time  —   may have been motivated by the holiday party set to take place in the same room after the training ended. The chief, Jarrod Burguan, cited comments made by the female attacker before the shooting. Malik had said online “that she didn’t think that a Muslim should have to participate in a   holiday or event,” Burguan told ABC News. The room where the training occurred  —   the same room where the health department had held   training earlier that year  —   was filled at the time with Christmas decorations, including a large Christmas tree, ornaments and items on the walls.    San Bernardino Police Chief Jarrod Burguan speaks at a news conference after the attack. (Chris   Press)  “That really is one of the very, very few pieces of potential evidence that we have that we can truly point to and say, that possibly is a motive in this case,” Burguan said. Investigators have said that both Farook and his wife showed a   interest in potential violence. Before the couple got married and Malik came to the United States, the two exchanged messages online “showing signs in their communication of their joint commitment to jihad and to martyrdom,” FBI Director James B. Comey said last year. The missing 18 minutes About four hours elapsed between the mass shooting and the deaths of Farook and Malik. Federal investigators say they have tracked most of their activity during that period, but they have still not been able to pin down what they did during a mysterious 18 minutes. In January, the FBI appealed to the public for any help, saying that it could be crucial to determining whether the couple interacted with anyone else after the shooting. David Bow dich, assistant director in charge of the FBI’s Los Angeles office, said this gap was pivotal because “until we close that gap, we just don’t know for sure. ”    Photo of Tashfeen Malik, center, and Syed Rizwan Farook, right, going through Chicago’s O’Hare International Airport in 2014. (ABC News)  Through traffic cameras, surveillance footage, witnesses and other resources, investigators have figured out some of what Farook and Malik did during the four hours. About 45 minutes after the shooting, they visited the city’s Lake Seccombe, so evidence recovery divers were dispatched into the water to see what they could find. None of the items recovered appeared to be relevant to the investigation, the FBI said. There is still a window between 12:59 p. m. and 1:17 p. m. where, as Bowdich put it earlier this year, “we’re dark. ” The iPhone fight The investigation has not resulted in any charges directly stemming from the attack, but authorities are still looking at “whether Farook and Malik were supported in any way in the planning, financing or execution of the attack,” Laura Eimiller, an FBI spokeswoman, said in an email. This lingering question of whether anyone was involved in or knew about the plot played a central role in a bitter fight between Apple and the Justice Department over Farook’s iPhone. Federal authorities had demanded that Apple unlock the device, but the tech giant pushed back in what became an ongoing    with broader implications for encryption and security.    FBI Director James B. Comey had argued that it was necessary for Apple to help unlock the phone. (Jonathan  )  Apple argued that the fight was about “much more than a single phone or a single investigation” and could threaten civil liberties, while Comey, the FBI director, said investigators needed to access the phone because it was possible it “holds the clue to finding more terrorists. ” Ultimately, the FBI wound up paying professional hackers a sizable   fee, ending for the moment that particular feud with Apple. According to officials, nothing of particular significance was found on the phone, which was owned by the county and issued to Farook through his job. False reports of people seeing “bombs all over the apartment” While investigators continue checking whether anyone else knew about the attack, a particularly   voice has repeatedly suggested that there are people who knew Farook and Malik had amassed explosives and guns and never reported it.   Donald Trump has asserted that numerous people saw these devices in the couple’s home and never said anything. (He has used this claim to argue that American Muslims need to report suspicious activity, which the FBI says they already do.)  “In San Bernardino, many people saw the bombs all over the apartment of the two people that killed 14 and wounded many, many people,” Trump said during the second presidential debate, adding: “Muslims have to report the problems when they see them. ” He has made similar comments before, asserting that people said nothing out of fear of being accused of racial profiling. The remarks appear to be based on interviews given by people in the area around the couple’s home after the shooting. One person working in the neighborhood told a local outlet he had seen numerous Middle Eastern men in the area but did not report anything to avoid racial profiling. Another man told a local broadcast station that an unspecified person saw purported suspicious activity  —   including the couple getting numerous deliveries and working in the garage at odd times  —   but, again, did not want to be seen as involved in racial profiling. Neither of these accounts included anyone saying they “saw bombs all over the apartment” of the attackers, as Trump asserted. Eimiller, the FBI spokeswoman, said investigators have not substantiated any of those accounts given to news outlets.    A makeshift vigil near the shooting site last year. (Jabin   Washington Post)  Friends and family of the attackers arrested Farook and Malik orphaned their    daughter the day of the attack, and Farook’s older sister, Saira Khan, is still trying to get custody of the toddler. “What kind of parent makes plans to abandon their child?” she told The Washington Post recently. “How were they capable of something like that and we didn’t know?” Federal authorities have said that Farook had also plotted at least two other attacks years before he spoke with Malik, making detailed plans with his friend, Enrique Marquez Jr. who was arrested last year.    In a courtroom sketch, Enrique Marquez Jr. appeared in federal court. (Bill  )  Authorities said there is no evidence that Marquez had any involvement in the attack last year, but they charged him with buying the guns that would be used in the shooting and said he bought explosive material found in a pipe bomb left behind by Farook and Malik. Marquez is one of four people connected to the attackers who has been arrested and charged since the shooting, although none were accused of any direct involvement. Earlier this year, officials arrested Farook’s brother, Syed Raheel Farook, as well as Raheel’s wife, Tatiana Farook, and her sister, Mariya Chernykh. Marquez and Chernykh are married, and they are all accused of committing fraud or lying to keep up a sham marriage so that she could get immigration benefits. Raheel, his wife and his    are all set to stand trial in March, while Marquez’s trial is set for next September, nearly two years after he was arrested.

","  VIENNA  —   He is a political disrupter supported by   websites that traffic in fake news. His campaign’s embrace of rumor defied the rules of electoral civility, turning the presidential race into the bitterest in decades.   His country is Austria, and his name is Norbert Hofer. Austrians go the polls Sunday in a rerun presidential election following a campaign displaying remarkable similarities to populist politics on both sides of the Atlantic. It is as if Hofer  —   from the nationalist,   Freedom Party  —   is reading from the same winning playbook as   Donald Trump.  Take, for example, the question of “stamina. ”  As early as the spring, Hofer, 45, began exuding concern about the health of his   opponent, Alexander Van der Bellen, noting the   ’s “forgetfulness. ”    Austrian presidential candidate Alexander Van der Bellen, who is supported by the Greens, listens during an interview with Reuters in his office in Vienna, Austria, Nov. 11, 2016. (Leonhard  )  What followed was the kind of electioneering rare in Austrian politics. Hofer’s campaign manager then told the media that “Mr. Van der Bellen appears slow; in fact, he displays a certain exhaustion. ” By June, the   blog “Politically Incorrect” published a letter allegedly submitted to Austrian authorities asserting that Van der Bellen was stricken with dementia and cancer. So severe was his case  —   the fake letter attested  —   that Van der Bellen required a legal guardian.  The Freedom Party denied any links to the letter. But the fake news spread so quickly  —   and so damagingly  —   that Van der Bellen’s campaign was forced to release his medical records to refute them. The health issue was only one of several false rumors and reports  —   including allegations of Van der Bellen family ties to the Nazis  —   that his campaign has struggled to put down.    slogans, meanwhile, have popped up on the Internet, including a hashtag for “Make Austria Great Again” and an Internet meme showing the country’s borders at the height of the   Empire.  Already, the Freedom Party is cultivating ties with the Trump camp. Ahead of the U. S. election, a Freedom Party delegation traveled to the United States and met with Trump’s senior supporters, including Michael T. Flynn, who has been tapped as his national security adviser. Several Freedom Party politicians also attended the   celebration at Trump Tower in New York. “There have been a lot of insults, slander and even death threats against Van der Bellen, which goes well beyond the usual scrawling on posters and campaign buses,” said Lothar Lockl, Van der Bellen’s campaign manager. “The anger and hatred deliberately spread along with fake news and false rumors in echo chambers on Facebook have been an issue. ” The candidates are now in a virtual tie. Should Hofer win, he would take over a ceremonial but constitutionally ambiguous job as president that he has contentiously vowed to vest with real power.      Meet the European leaders hoping to cause the next Brexit View Graphic     Meet the European leaders hoping to cause the next Brexit  In the wake of the American elections, calculations on his electability have changed. From the snowy Alps to the emerald wine country in Austria’s deep south, talk now is of a possible “Trump bump”  —   a sense that Americans may have broken a key psychological barrier in their election last month.  Like Hillary Clinton’s campaign, Van der Bellen’s is asking Austrians to vote for him in part to reject Hofer and avoid damaging the nation’s reputation on the world stage. Yet, if the United States can elect Trump, then why, some here argue, shouldn’t Austrians give Hofer a chance?  In fact, Hofer’s supporters say, he would simply be the next pillar in a “new world order” in which   nationalists could rise from Washington to Vienna, Paris to The Hague. They see the disruptive forces of the   spreading. Italians on Sunday will vote on a restructuring referendum deeply opposed by the populist Five Star Movement. The measure’s failure could bring down the   government. “Wherever the elites distance themselves from voters, those elites will be voted out of office,” Hofer told Reuters last month. “One comparison could be that Trump also had strong [political] headwinds in the U. S. and he won the election anyway. ” As if in an alternate reality in which Trump lost and contested the race, Hofer’s Freedom Party did just that  —   successfully overturning his defeat by just 31, 000 votes last May.  If made the first   head of state in Western Europe since World War II, Hofer could exercise his duties in unprecedented ways, his campaign says. He might refuse, for instance, to sign Europe’s free trade deal with Canada and could call a referendum on the Paris Agreement to combat climate change. He has also flirted with a referendum on European Union membership  —   a possible death blow to the bloc following Britain’s vote to leave it.  As with Trump’s tactics in the United States, Hofer’s methods have upended politics here. Hofer tends to portray the hosts of debates as well as his opponents as foolish when he is asked critical questions, and, in   fashion, he launches into unrelated attacks. When asked during a debate whether he should distance himself from Austria’s nationalistic fraternities long linked to racists, Hofer, for instance, attacked the questioner. “You are so desperate and depressed today. When I saw you six weeks ago, you were such a happy person,” he retorted. While somehow maintaining a    demeanor, Hofer drops innuendoes like bombs and takes seemingly contradictory positions. He has courted Jews and Israel. Yet during a debate, he accused Van der Bellen of being supported by the Freemasons  —   which some observers saw as an   reference to a Jewish power structure.  In manner, Hofer is wholly unlike the bombastic Trump, speaking in an   style that comes off as downright neighborly. Last month, he told Austrian broadcaster ZIB 2 that Trump’s election campaign had been “horrible. ” “I’m happy that we don’t have anything like this in this style in Austria,” he said. Yet Hofer has embraced an uncannily similar platform. He is   speaks of   fences, says Islam is “not part” of Austria and wants to increase surveillance on mosques.  His single biggest issue is immigration. He argues that at current birthrates, Muslim immigrants would soon overwhelm native Austrians. A 2013 study said the number of Muslims in Austria increased almost 70 percent since 2001, reaching 574, 000, or 7 percent of the population.     Hofer’s campaign maintains a complex, synergistic relationship with Austria’s Identitarian activists  —   a   movement supporting   nationalism. While he has distanced himself from the movement, his party leadership has also cultivated it  —   sharing, for instance, stories sympathetic to the group on social media. Martin Sellner, a university student in Vienna and Identitarian who sports an undercut hair style with a sharp part that is popular with   youth, is a living bridge between Trump and Hofer. He proudly owns a “Make America Great Again” hat and, on the night of the U. S. election, burst in on a Democrats Abroad pub party in Vienna to shout “Lock her up!” and “Build that wall!”  Austria’s nationalists, he hopes, will get their chance on Sunday. “We want to disrupt the firewall of multicultural societies,” he said. “You did it in the U. S. with Trump. Now we want it here. ”  Stephanie Kirchner contributed to this report.     "
142022,217369,Second-chance law for young criminals puts violent offenders back on D.C. streets,Washington Post,Amy Brittain,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161203001010/https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/second-chance-law-for-young-criminals-puts-violent-offenders-back-on-dc-streets/2016/12/02/fcb56c74-8bc1-11e6-875e-2c1bfe943b66_story.html
","          CITY | This is part of a continuing series that will examine issues related to repeat violent offenders in the District of Columbia.  Part I | Part II     Hundreds of criminals sentenced by D. C. judges under an obscure local law crafted to give second chances to young adult offenders have gone on to rob, rape or kill residents of the nation’s capital. The original intent of the law was to rehabilitate inexperienced criminals under the age of 22. The District’s Youth Rehabilitation Act allows for shorter sentences for some crimes and an opportunity for offenders to emerge with no criminal record. But a Washington Post investigation has found a pattern of violent offenders returning rapidly to the streets and committing more crimes. Hundreds have been sentenced under the act multiple times. In dozens of cases, D. C. judges were able to hand down Youth Act sentences shorter than those called for under mandatory minimum laws designed to deter armed robberies and other violent crimes. The criminals have often repaid that leniency by escalating their crimes of violence upon release. In 2013, four masked men entered the home of a family in Northeast Washington, held them at gunpoint and ransacked the house. One of the invaders, Shareem Hall, was sentenced under the Youth Act. He was released on probation in 2015. Almost exactly a year later, Hall and a   shot a    transgender woman, Deeniquia Dodds, during a robbery in the District, according to charging documents. It is unclear who pulled the trigger. Police said the pair were targeting transgender females. Dodds died nine days later. “You’re telling me you can come back out on the streets and rob again, hold people hostage again, kill again  —   because of the Youth Act?” said Joeann Lewis, Dodds’s aunt.    Joeann Lewis, with the ashes of her niece, Deeniquia Dodds, a transgender woman killed in Northeast Washington in July, allegedly by Shareem Hall and a  . (Linda   Washington Post)  Hall is one of at least 121 defendants sentenced under the Youth Act who have gone on to be charged with murder in the District since 2010, according to The Post’s analysis of available sentencing data and court records. Four of the slayings, including the killing of Dodds, occurred while the defendants could still have been incarcerated for previous crimes under mandatory minimum sentencing, and 30 of the killings took place while the suspects were on probation. Youth Act offenders accounted for 1 in 5 suspects arrested on homicide charges in the District since 2010, a period that has seen a recent surge in homicides and growing public concern about repeat violent offenders. The cycle of violence has been largely shrouded from public view or oversight. D. C. judges do not track the use of the law, which provides a benefit to violent felons that experts say does not exist anywhere else in the country.      The District’s Youth Rehabilitation Act offers lenient sentences to offenders under 22 years old. But the Post found that at least 120 people sentenced under the Act since 2010 have gone on to be charged with murder. (Whitney   Washington Post)   After a young adult is convicted of a crime, the Youth Act allows judges to decide whether the offender can benefit from rehabilitation and should receive special treatment. The law gives felons a chance to have their convictions expunged from the public record if they serve out their sentences or complete their probation. Because of the way the law was written, Youth Act offenders also can avoid mandatory prison time for certain violent gun crimes. The Post also found that judges applying the Youth Act generally give lighter sentences across the board. The law was enacted in 1985 during the mayoral administration of Marion Barry (D) at a time when jails were being filled with young men charged with drug crimes, in an attempt to protect African American youths from the stigma of lengthy prison sentences.  “We have a value in this city that youthful offenders should be rehabilitated,” said D. C. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser. “But I don’t think anybody expects leniency for violent criminals. ” The judges declined The Post’s requests for interviews and also declined to comment about specific cases. In a written statement, the judges said they weigh many factors in sentencing, including the ages of offenders and the effect of their crimes on the victims.    “In considering whether to sentence a young person under the Youth Act, generally judges are aware that a felony conviction can create lifelong obstacles to becoming a good and productive citizen,” wrote Lynn Leibovitz and Milton Lee, who are, respectively, the presiding judge and deputy presiding judge of the criminal division of the D. C. Superior Court. “It is important to note that a sentence under the Youth Act gives the defendant this opportunity, not a guarantee, to get the benefit of a set aside of the conviction  —   it is still up to the defendant to perform during his or her sentence and to apply to the court or the Parole Commission to receive the benefit of the Youth Act. If the offender does not perform well, the conviction remains on his or her record. ” The D. C. Public Defender Service defended the use of the law. “The Youth Act is a valuable sentencing option because as the Supreme Court has recognized and science has shown, youthful offenders, compared to older adults, can have diminished culpability and greater prospects for reform,” said PDS general counsel Laura Hankins in a written statement. She said her office knows of “hundreds” of young offenders who have successfully completed their sentences. From January 2010 to April 2016, 3, 188 sentences for felony crimes were handed down under the Youth Act, 73 percent of them in cases involving violent crimes or weapons offenses, The Post found.    To assess the effects of the Youth Act, The Post obtained data from the D. C. Sentencing Commission showing the date and outcome of every felony case since 2010. The data did not include names of offenders or judges, or details of the crimes. To link individuals to crimes, The Post wrote software to extract those details for every criminal case, including those that mentioned the Youth Act, in publicly available electronic court dockets. This search captured Youth Act cases in which people had not received the benefit of expungement either because they were still serving their sentences or had violated the terms of probation or release from prison. The overall success rate of the program is unclear because the identities of offenders disappear from public view if they complete the terms of their sentences. Among The Post’s findings: • At least 136 Youth Act sentences were given to young offenders convicted of armed robbery since 2010. • At least 750 offenders have been sentenced multiple times under the Youth Act in the past decade. More than 200 of those were sentenced for multiple violent or weapons offenses. • Judges have given roughly 2, 300 Youth Act sentences to young offenders for weapons offenses or crimes of violence since 2010. On average, the offenders have received about 60 percent of the prison time of   Act offenders who had comparable criminal histories and had committed similar crimes.    When asked about The Post’s findings, Leibovitz and Lee responded that the court “does not comment on data based on percentages, since sentencing is an individualized event based on many considerations. ” In a survey of states across the country, The Post was unable to find any law similar to the District’s Youth Act. An expert in national expungement laws told The Post that leniency programs typically focus on   or juvenile offenders and apply expungement to misdemeanors or other nonviolent crimes. “I’ve never heard of something like this,” said Anne Teigen, a program principal at the National Conference of State Legislatures in Colorado. “It is opposite of the trend nationally. ” In the District, Youth Act sentences have been handed down in cases involving victims who are vulnerable in ways that ordinarily lead to tougher sentences: an elderly woman held up at gunpoint; a brother and sister  —   12 and 13 years old  —   kidnapped outside their middle school and held hostage by someone armed with a box cutter; a pizza deliveryman hit on the head with a brick during a robbery; the driver of an ice cream truck whose vehicle was taken during an armed carjacking. In the summer of 2015, a D. C. jury found    twins Christopher and Christina Lucas guilty of committing a hate crime against a gay man in Columbia Heights in 2013. The twins stomped on the man, one called him a “       ” and his face was slashed with a sharp object. Prosecutors said the case very easily “could have been a homicide. ” They asked for 15 years.

Superior Court Judge Yvonne Williams departed from voluntary sentencing guidelines, which recommended four to 15 years, and gave the twins a year in jail under the Youth Act. At a hearing two weeks later, amid community outrage, Williams justified her decision by invoking the Eminem song, “Lose Yourself,” saying that the Youth Act was designed to give “one shot” for the twins to reform. “It’s the most inspirational song, even though he’s applying it to, like, rap music,” the judge said in court. “It’s like, you only get one shot. And his one shot is that he had to  —   you know, it’s in the movie ‘8 Mile’ . . . the rap has to be so good. You only get one shot. ” The twins were rearrested this fall, Christopher for allegedly making a verbal threat and Christina for allegedly attempting to block officers from arresting her brother. Judge Williams declined to comment for this story. D. C. politicians wrote the Youth Act, but the judges, prosecutors and public defenders in the District who carry out the law are funded by Congress, because of the unique split in federal and local authority in the District. The judges are nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate for   terms and are not accountable to D. C. voters. Briefed on The Post’s findings, Mayor Bowser (D) said she thinks judges, prosecutors and public defenders have come to “misapply” the law at the expense of public safety. “Prosecutions, plea deals, sentences rendered, sentences served, and then what happens when folks are being supervised . . . the community should know that,” she said. “We can’t have a safe city if there are no quick and certain punishments for crimes. ” ‘I saw their scared faces’ Last year, homicides in the District jumped 54 percent from the previous year to 162, the highest total since 2008. A survey found that for the first time in almost a decade, crime had become the top concern of D. C. residents. Killings in 2015 charged to prior Youth Act recipients reached 22, double the previous year’s total.  Tavon Pinkney was charged with one of those 22 homicides. In 2014, the    was arrested on a robbery charge after he snatched a man’s Apple iPad. It was the first adult offense for Pinkney. “I wasn’t really worried,” Pinkney said in a recent prison interview with The Post. “I knew they were going to let me off easy. ” Pinkney said that he had committed at least a dozen robberies by the time he was arrested. “I saw their scared faces,” he told The Post of his victims. “But I never thought about their feelings. I was just being selfish. ” Pinkney pleaded guilty to attempted robbery, and Judge Anita   suspended his sentence and gave him probation under the Youth Act. “I will give him a Youth Act because I do, and it may be aspirational, believe that people should have an opportunity to change their lives,” she said. But Pinkney didn’t take that opportunity. “I went back to doing the same thing,” he said. “Nothing changed. . . . They just gave me the Youth Act and let me go right back out there. They ain’t really care. ”     Rico Myers (Metropolitan Police Department)     Matthew Shlonsky (Metropolitan Police Department)    In February 2015, five months into his probation, Pinkney shot Rico Myers four times during a daytime PCP deal. He pleaded guilty to   murder and is serving a   sentence in federal prison in Pennsylvania. “I know I could have been better. It’s just what I chose,” said Pinkney, who is now 20. “It’s crazy, because my brain is not even fully developed yet. ” Judge   declined to comment for this story. In at least 30 homicide cases, defendants had received Youth Act sentences more than once before  —   turning a second chance into a third or even fourth opportunity to return to the community. Christopher Proctor, Andre Dudley and a third person are charged in the August 2015 killing of Matthew Shlonsky, a    American University graduate who was caught in crossfire near the Shaw Metro Station. Proctor had received two sentences under the Youth Act, including one for attempted theft in 2010. Dudley had received three sentences under the Youth Act, including one in 2014 for escaping from a youth detention facility. Both have pleaded not guilty in the shooting of Shlonsky.    Jermaine Hailes (Prince George’s County Police)  “The program isn’t working, because people are dying,” said Brendan Walsh, a fraternity brother of Shlonsky’s. “The government has some culpability in that. ”  On New Year’s Day in 2007, a    woman, Willa Kynard, was walking with her cane when a young man jumped out of a white van, pointed a gun at her and demanded her purse. “Oh, Jesus, don’t let him shoot me,” Kynard thought, according to court documents. The van eventually crashed after a police chase, and Jermaine Hailes, then 16, who was found hiding in a dumpster, was linked to two other robberies that night. He was charged as an adult and pleaded guilty to one count of armed robbery. Judge Harold Cushenberry cited the Youth Act in sentencing Hailes to three years in prison, two years less than the mandatory minimum. Cushenberry declined to comment for this story. After his release from prison, Hailes shot    Melvin Pate in the face in 2010 during a robbery in Maryland. Pate, who was paralyzed, was able to identify Hailes as his attacker by blinking in response to being shown Hailes’s picture in a photo lineup. Pate died two years after the shooting, and Hailes was convicted this year of   murder. A Prince George’s County judge sentenced him to 70 years in prison.

(Family photo)  ‘Left of liberalism’ The District’s Youth Act was modeled after a failed federal law that was drafted in the 1940s for a different kind of criminal in a much different time. Members of Congress sought a way to curb juvenile delinquency, including clearing the records of soldiers returning from World War II who were getting permanent rap sheets with convictions for disorderly conduct, petty theft or assault. The Federal Youth Corrections Act, passed in 1950, applied to youthful offenders charged with federal crimes throughout the United States and all crimes in the District of Columbia. The goal was rehabilitation, not punishment. Congress eventually helped fund construction of a youth center at the site of the Lorton prison in Fairfax County, Va. to house most Youth Act prisoners from the District. There, the sleeping quarters resembled a college campus, and inmates were required to wear coats and ties. The Lorton Youth Center had a printing plant, a dairy farm and a furniture factory for vocational training.     An inmate sits on his bed in a dorm room at the Lorton Reformatory in Lorton, Va. in 1996. (James A.   Washington Post)     Inmates were gradually being moved from the prison in Lorton in the late 1990s. (Dennis   The Washington Post)    But riots broke out repeatedly in the 1960s and ’70s, pushing prison officials to impose more   time. By the early 1980s, rising crime rates were souring the country on rehabilitation. In the District, residents overwhelmingly voted to implement mandatory minimum prison terms of five years for violent crimes committed with guns. In 1984, Congress repealed the federal Youth Act, in part because there was little evidence that the law was effective. The D. C. Council and   Barry expressed shock and disgust. Wilhelmina J. Rolark (D)   of the D. C. Council’s Judiciary Committee, drafted a law for the District. Rolark, who died in 2006, said “extra care” needed to be taken to prevent young black men from being labeled as career criminals. Barry’s administration argued that many violent crimes should be   for Youth Act sentences. But Rolark’s committee said all crimes except for murder and a second violent crime committed while armed would be eligible for Youth Act sentencing. Rolark’s committee passed the bill 3 to 1. John Ray, now a lawyer, was the lone no vote.    John Ray, now an attorney, talks about the Youth Rehabilitation Act in the District. (Linda   Washington Post)  “I consider myself a liberal, but I put those three as left of liberalism,” Ray said. “I grew up in Georgia, and everyone around me was poor, but I didn’t  —   and still don’t  —   accept the position that you should get a pass for violent crime because you’re poor or you didn’t come from the best family. I think people must be held responsible for their conduct. ” On July 11, 1985, the council passed the bill, 9 to 4, with Ray (D) having registered his protest, flipping his vote. Barry signed it into law that month. But in the late 1990s, facing the threat of bankruptcy, D. C. officials agreed to a federal bailout that transferred supervision of inmates to the federal government. The Lorton Youth Center closed, and D. C. prisoners were dispersed across the country to federal prisons, where there were no rehabilitation programs expressly targeting them. Eric H. Holder Jr. then a deputy U. S. attorney general, led a commission reviewing all D. C. criminal laws to bring them in line with federal statutes. “No other single issue provoked as much debate in the Commission as did the Youth Act,” the commission said in 1998. Commission members were concerned about judges’ using the Youth Act to override mandatory minimums and considered banning the act for violent offenders. “Several commissioners observed that the inclusion of violent youthful offenders destroyed the federal Youth Corrections Act and was wreaking havoc on the D. C. Youth Rehabilitation Act,” the commission wrote. Like all federal inmates, Youth Act offenders would now be required to serve 85 percent of their sentences. But the commission ultimately decided not to take a position on violent offenders. In 2000,  . C. Council member Harold Brazil (D) lobbied for a sentencing reform act that would have excluded most violent felons from the Youth Act. “The Youth Act makes sense for less serious crimes,” Brazil said then. “For the heinous stuff, well, it’s just not going to do much good. ” The Public Defender Service argued that young black men would be irreparably harmed. “If this bill passes as adopted, it will almost certainly increase incarceration rates and racial disparities in the District’s criminal justice system,” wrote Robert Wilkins, chief of special litigation for the service, in an   in The Post. Wilkins is now a judge on the U. S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. The law was once again left intact.    Inmates in the south end hallway of the District’s Central Detention Facility. (Linda   Washington Post)  ‘They’re just letting you off’ About half of the young offenders in the age group eligible for Youth Act sentences  —   those younger than 22  —   receive them. Youth Act sentences account for about 15 percent of all felony sentences in D. C. Superior Court. Prosecutors and defense attorneys turn to the law to make plea deals. The Public Defender Service’s manual highlights the Youth Act as a way to get around mandatory prison time for certain violent gun crimes. To ensure at least some prison time in an unpredictable legal system, prosecutors negotiating plea deals often agree to not oppose the application of the Youth Act. “If you try to prosecute a case that is not built on strong evidence, and that defendant is subsequently exonerated, all you have done is emboldened that defendant to believe he can always beat the system,” said Ronald C. Machen Jr. who was U. S. attorney in the District from 2010 to 2015. “He will feel like he is a Teflon Don. ” D. C. Council Chairman Phil Mendelson (D) faults prosecutors as willing to offer generous deals to violent criminals. “When they dumb down the charges, over and over, they are missing what’s necessary to put the violent repeat offender away,” he said. Judges are given wide leeway to apply the law. In some cases, judges order inmates at the jail to undergo lengthy evaluations, known as “Youth Act studies. ” The evaluations include interviews with psychologists or social workers. If defendants are not in jail, judges can allow defense attorneys to hire their own experts to conduct the studies. Judges also are authorized to give Youth Act sentences without ordering studies.    Antwon Pitt (Prince George’s County state’s attorney’s office)  Youth Act studies are not made public. The Public Defender Service, D. C. Superior Court judges and jail officials denied requests from The Post to review studies. In 2013, Antwon Pitt was under consideration for a Youth Act sentence after pleading guilty to robbing a D. C. woman and assaulting a police officer. He had already been convicted of aggravated assault and battery in a different case and had received a Youth Act sentence for a misdemeanor. Pitt’s defense attorney argued that he should be eligible for benefits under the law because the author of Pitt’s Youth Act study recommended that approach. “I know,” Judge Heidi Pasichow said. “It’s very rare that people are not recommended, but he’s violent. ” Ultimately, she sentenced Pitt to the statutory minimum for robbery  —   24 months  —   to be served in prison, and gave him a chance to have his record expunged under the Youth Act. About two months after his release from prison, Pitt committed a brutal rape during a home invasion in the Hill East neighborhood of the District. He has since been convicted and sentenced to 60 years in prison.  Pasichow declined to comment for this story. No study was done for William Smallwood, who benefited from the Youth Act twice  —   once in an assault case, then in a robbery case  —   before he killed a man about a year and a half later, at age 22.    Rashard Raigns (Metropolitan Police Department)  He pleaded guilty to the   murder of Rashard Raigns and was sentenced to 22 years in prison. Smallwood, during a prison interview in West Virginia, said he was surprised that he was twice sentenced under the Youth Act without any evaluation. “The Youth Act is not what it’s cracked up to be,” he told The Post. “They’re just letting you off. But you’re not getting any help. ” A spokesman from the Bureau of Prisons told The Post that the agency realizes the “greater vulnerability” of young adults and works with Youth Act offenders to develop personalized goals to prepare them for a “productive and lasting return to the community. ” Not all judges embrace the Youth Act. Judge Jennifer Anderson, who was hearing a 2010 case involving a defendant who reached for a loaded gun and struggled with police officers, denied his request for the Youth Act. She said the defendant’s conduct was not “a single, isolated event attributable to youthful indiscretion, which is the type of case that is appropriate for the benefit of the Youth Rehabilitation Act in this court’s opinion. ” This year, criminal justice officials in the District met with The Post’s editorial board and a group of Post reporters to defend the system in the aftermath of the Pitt case. During the meeting, Judge Leibovitz, head of the Superior Court’s criminal division, characterized the Youth Act as simply a way for offenders to have their records expunged if they do not get in trouble again. “It’s words on a page, unless and until the person is successful,” she said. Leibovitz disputed the idea that Youth Act sentences equate to leniency. She said the court does not keep statistics on Youth Act sentences that go below mandatory minimums. The Post’s review of 136   sentences under the Youth Act showed that, on average, they were two years less than regular   sentences. The Post found at least 20   cases committed with guns that resulted in Youth Act sentences below the   mandatory minimum since 2010. An additional 35   cases included the stipulation in plea deals that imitation guns were used in the commission of the crimes. Those deals sometimes were contradicted by sworn statements from the defendants that described their possession of real guns. The Post found one case in which a man convicted of   murder, Kurtis Faison, was sentenced under the Youth Act, although the law expressly prohibits the inclusion of convicted murderers. Judges and prosecutors declined to comment on the legality of the 2013 sentence issued by Judge Henry Greene. ‘  quarterback’ Interim D. C. Metropolitan Police Chief Peter Newsham said community members are often frustrated when they see violent criminals return to the streets.    Bijon Brown (Courtesy of Metro Transit Police)  “They will look to the police and ask us, ‘What the heck happened?’ ” he said. “And that can be frustrating for our officers. ” Newsham said he thinks repeat violent offenders illustrate how the criminal justice system has failed to protect the public. “Someone, somewhere along the line, should have done something to prevent that from happening,” he said. The Post identified more than 200 criminals who received Youth Act sentences more than once for weapons offenses or violent crimes in the past decade. In February 2015, Bijon Brown lived in Forest Ridge, a public housing complex in Southeast Washington where   numbers mark the apartment buildings. A short hike down a hill leads to the turf of a rival neighborhood crew. On a Monday morning on Presidents’ Day, Brown confronted two teenage boys near a small basketball court. He opened fire, striking one of them in the leg. Brown later admitted to the shooting and told police officers that he had thrown the gun into the Anacostia River. Brown’s defense attorney said there had been an ongoing neighborhood feud. The attorney said Brown had only been trying to scare the boys.    Judge Anita   (Michael   The Washington Post)  “I understand I made a mistake and all that, but, I’m just trying to get my life in order, that’s all,” Brown told Judge  . Brown pleaded guilty to attempted assault with a dangerous weapon. The prosecutor and defense attorney agreed on a   sentence, with all time suspended. Prosecutor Scott Ray said in court filings that Brown had accepted responsibility for his actions and had saved the system considerable resources by swiftly taking the plea deal. The prosecutor did not oppose the Youth Act for Brown’s case. The judge gave Brown the   sentence and placed him on probation under the Youth Act. “The hope is that, you know, this will be the last time that we all see you and that you will have a productive life,” the judge said. On Aug. 21, 2015  —   29 days into his probation  —   Brown opened fire aboard a Metrobus after a rival neighborhood crew surrounded the bus. The shooting was captured on video, and police quickly identified him as a suspect. After the identification, Mayor Bowser held a news conference to put a spotlight on Brown. “These are the folks that are driving a lot of the crime in the District,” she said, questioning why he had been released so quickly. Three weeks later, police officers found Brown hiding in a friend’s closet. He pleaded guilty to unlawful possession of a firearm, with an agreement that prosecutors would not request more than 15 months’ incarceration. This time, prosecutors opposed giving Brown the Youth Act. “He took that entire bus full of people and he took them into a battle zone,” prosecutor William Schurmann said. Brown told the judge that he planned to turn his life around and move away from his violent neighborhood once he was released from jail. “The picture has been painted of me that maybe I am a monster or I am somebody that may just want to carry around guns shooting at people,” he told   in April. “I just want to let everybody know that I am not the monster that everybody looks at me to be. ”   sentenced him to a year and a day in jail under the Youth Act. By August 2016, Brown was out of jail, with credit applied for the time he had already served. Nine days after Brown’s release, a man reported that he had been held at gunpoint during a carjacking near the Rhode Island Avenue Metro station in Northeast Washington. Later, during a police chase, the fleeing car crashed into a front yard, and its three occupants fled. Brown was caught. He was charged with unauthorized use of a vehicle. His case is pending. In September,   took a moment on the bench to reflect on Brown’s past sentencings. She cast blame on the juvenile victims of the first shooting, saying they had been “terrorizing” the neighborhood. Then she said the Metrobus shooting had looked like “something out of ‘Straight Outta Compton’ ” because of the “mob” of men that confronted Brown. “I really think it is easy to   quarterback judges as we are making decisions that have more context,” she said, staring at a Post reporter taking notes in the courtroom. “Because otherwise, you just get a computer and it spits out a sentence. ”   declined a Post request to comment on the Brown case. ‘He’s 19 years old’ On Oct. 3, 2013, Mikiyas Getachew took a taxi to his home in Northeast Washington. It was about 2:45 a. m. and as he fumbled with his key to open the door, he felt the barrel of a gun against the back of his head.    The former residence of Mikiyas Getachew and his family in Northeast Washington, where they were robbed at gunpoint in 2013. (Linda   Washington Post)  He looked up to see men in ski masks. They took his wallet, Tag Heuer watch and cellphone. They forced him to unlock the door, pushing him inside. The commotion awoke his mother and his fiancee, Nava. The robbers held them at gunpoint on their knees. The men carried televisions out of bedrooms, grabbed laptops and took Nava’s $5, 000 engagement ring. The men loaded the items into the victims’ cars, a Nissan Altima and a Honda CRV, and took off. The men set the vehicles ablaze six miles away, behind a shuttered school in Southeast. Later that day, D. C. police surrounded an abandoned house a few blocks away from where the vehicles were set alight and found the suspects and goods stolen from the Getachew home. The man prosecutors said had the gun at the start of the crime, Andre Townsend, then 19, was on pretrial release in a case in which he allegedly assaulted two young men with a handgun. Getachew pleaded for harsh penalties for the perpetrators: “What we would like to see is justice being served to the fullest against these defendants. ” Nava and Mikiyas Getachew never found the engagement ring. They have since moved away from the District. If Townsend had been convicted of all 18 charges against him, he could have faced 29 to 65 years under sentencing guidelines. Prosecutors said Townsend had expressed remorse. They offered a plea that dropped 14 of 18 charges, including three of armed kidnapping.    Judge William Jackson (Michael   The Washington Post)  But prosecutor Ben Schrader told Judge William Jackson that the Youth Act was not appropriate for Townsend. “This is not a   robbery case,” he said. “It’s a concerted effort by a group of people to commit a pretty heinous act. ” Defense attorney Kelli Neptune said the authors of a Youth Act study had recommended that Townsend receive the benefits of the law. “The Youth Act is given even in homicide cases,” she told Judge Jackson. Townsend said he wanted to speak. “I want to say I apologize to the victim and my family, and that’s it,” Townsend said. Judge Jackson said he thought the sentence in the plea deal reached between the defense and the prosecution was light, but he accepted it. He sentenced Townsend to 48 months for armed burglary and 48 months for armed robbery, to be served consecutively. Although the judge said it was a “very close” decision, he decided to apply the Youth Act to Townsend, who is to be released in 2020. “He’s 19 years old,” Jackson said. “So, that’s why I’m doing it. ” Shareem Hall, whose fingerprints were found at the scene of the crime, accepted responsibility for his actions and pleaded guilty to several charges, including conspiracy to commit a crime of violence while armed, which carries a mandatory prison term of at least five years. “I want to say that I’m truly, truly sorry to the victims. . . . I just pray that they forgive me,” the    said to Judge Jackson in 2015. “I no longer want to take from people anymore. ” Invoking the Youth Act, Jackson suspended Hall’s entire   prison sentence and set him free on probation. Earlier this year, police identified Hall as a suspect in the slaying of Dodds, the transgender woman shot during an attempted robbery on July 4 in Northeast Washington. Hall and a   now face the charge of “  murder while   murder. ” Their preliminary hearings are scheduled for Dec. 9. When police caught up with Hall in September, he was wearing a gray backpack. Inside, police said, was a Smith & Wesson .  handgun loaded with 10 rounds of ammunition.  Washington Post researchers Jennifer Jenkins, Alice Crites and Magda   and graduate students Shaun Courtney and Teaganne Finn, contributed to this report. Courtney and Finn are attached to The Post’s investigative unit through a program at American University.   How The Post studied the Youth Rehabilitation Act  To study the implementation of the District’s Youth Rehabilitation Act, The Washington Post drew from a number of sources, combining information where possible for a more complete understanding of the effects of the law. The Post requested and received a data set from the D. C. Sentencing Commission containing all 3, 188 felony sentences issued under the Youth Act from January 2010 to April 2016. The data did not contain information on the identities of those sentenced but included the ages of offenders, dates of conviction, charges at conviction and a statistical weighting of their criminal histories. The Post wrote software to search the Districts’s online court database to identify all publicly available criminal cases, felony and misdemeanor, 168, 265 between January 2007 and November 2016. The Post then pulled docket information on every case and analyzed the data, identifying all felony and misdemeanor crimes sentenced under the Youth Act that have not been expunged. By matching crimes and sentencing dates to the Sentencing Commission’s data, The Post was able to identify 85 percent of the 3, 188 felony offenders sentenced under the Youth Act since 2010. The Post also identified upward of 3, 000 misdemeanor crimes for which sentences were given under the Youth Act. Because the Sentencing Commission does not track these crimes, reporters could not determine how many convictions have been expunged because sentences have been successfully completed. The Post also requested data on those arrested on homicide charges in the District since 2010 from the Metropolitan Police Department. Using data pulled from the District’s court website, reporters identified 121 individuals arrested on homicide charges who previously were sentenced under the Youth Act. Reporters verified the identity of each offender by pulling files at D. C. Superior Court. "

","     The U. S. economy added 178, 000 jobs in November, while the unemployment rate fell to 4. 6 percent, a level not seen since August 2007, according to government data released Friday morning. The first employment report since voters went to the polls last month shows an economy in strong shape as   Donald Trump prepares to take office. “It looks like firms are pretty bullish about what they’re going to see in 2017 and are continuing their strong hiring of the past few years,” said Steve Rick, chief economist at insurance company CUNA Mutual Group. “This is a good tailwind for the new administration. ”   Democrats seized on the report as evidence that President Obama had cultivated a much more robust economy that Trump would now take over. “It is hard to imagine a more stark contrast between the economy that we are passing off to our successor and the economy we inherited,” said Christopher Lu, the deputy secretary of the Labor Department. The data comes a day after Trump celebrated a deal in Indiana to preserve about 1, 000 jobs at a furnace factory run by Carrier, a unit of United Technologies, saying he planned to intervene more frequently in corporate decisions to move jobs overseas. Carrier had planned to move a factory to Mexico, but partially relented under pressure from Trump and a $7 million tax subsidy from the state. On a conference call on Friday morning, a Trump transition team spokesperson called the decline in manufacturing jobs, wages and the labor force participation rate in November evidence of Obama’s failures, but said Americans were already looking forward to Trump’s economic stewardship. “What we’re starting to see now is a new sense of optimism,” said spokesman Jason Miller. “This incoming administration is one that is going to fight even before formally taking office to keep American jobs.”  Data released on Friday showed a sharp drop in the unemployment rate from 4. 9 percent the previous month, driven partly by the creation of new jobs and partly by people retiring and otherwise leaving the labor force. A broader measure of unemployment, the   rate, which includes those who have given up looking for work and   workers who would like to have   jobs, fell to 9. 3 percent, the lowest reading since April 2008. The figure still remains elevated from average levels in the 2000s. Average hourly earnings declined by 3 cents to $25. 89, paring back large gains in October. That drop surprised some economists, who were expecting a tighter labor market to continue to translate into wage gains for workers. But economists cautioned that    changes can be volatile and that, over the year, average hourly earnings are up 2. 5 percent. The report was largely in line with investor expectations, and stock markets were down slightly in   trading. Revisions to the job figures for September and October did not significantly alter previous data, removing only 2, 000 jobs in total.  The release comes ahead of the Federal Reserve’s Dec.   meeting, when the central bank is expected to announce its first interest rate increase in a year. Although wages fell slightly in November, many economists view the steady wage gains of the earlier months as a sign that a tightening labor market is allowing workers to demand higher pay, increasing pressure on the Fed to head off inflation by hiking interest rates. Trump has promised to spend heavily to rebuild America’s infrastructure. If realized, the plan would likely add more jobs to business payrolls and boost spending, consumer confidence and inflationary pressure throughout the economy. Trump surged to an electoral victory largely on the support of white,   voters fearful of job losses, especially in   industries like manufacturing and mining. He has pledged to restore   manufacturing jobs to the United States. That promise could be difficult to achieve, given the continuing trend toward automation and   shift of the economy away from manufacturing and toward the service sector, said Jed Kolko, chief economist at job search site Indeed.  In November, construction, professional and business services, and health care were among the   sectors of the economy, but manufacturing industry jobs declined compared with the previous month and one year ago. “To bring back manufacturing jobs means overcoming some pretty strong headwinds,” said Kolko. The jobs report contained further clues that Americans with skills and education are having little trouble finding work, but that those without continue to struggle. The unemployment rate for Americans with a bachelor’s degree or higher dipped to 2. 3 percent in November, but the rate for those with less than a   diploma rose to 7. 9 percent. “When you drill down into the data [for] more educated workers, you see an unemployment rate that’s pretty nice, and in recovery mode,” said Beth Ann Bovino, U. S. chief economist at S&P Global.  “But people with a high school education are still really hurting. That’s certainly a concern for them and their families, but also the recovery going forward. ” The November jobs report was also one of the final snapshots of the economy under Obama’s administration. The picture was dramatically different from Obama’s first months in the White House, when the private sector was shedding roughly 800, 000 jobs a month and the unemployment rate was at 10 percent. During Obama’s term as president, the U. S. economy “went from being in intensive care to walking under its own power,” said Mark Hamrick, Bankrate. com’s senior economic analyst. “It might even be jogging at this point. ”      America’s monthly jobs report can be hard to understand. Here’s what you need to know about   payroll employment and the unemployment rate —  with gummy bears to help explain. (Kate M. Tobey, Gillian Brockell, Jhaan   Washington Post)   "

"," Minutes before Holland America’s Nieuw Amsterdam was scheduled to depart for Fort Lauderdale, Berit and Dan Wick received an urgent call at home. Without delay, the couple hailed a taxi to the port terminal in Cartagena, Colombia. Once aboard the vessel, Dan approached an American stretched out on a hospital bed surrounded by the ship’s doctors and nurses. The woman was pale and struggling to breathe; an oxygen mask covered her face. Her    waited by the gangplank, filled with worry and concern. Dan accompanied Sue Wright in the ambulance, a bumpy ride along cobblestone roads. Berit loaded Rosemary Cox and 16 days’ worth of luggage into a car. By the time they reached the hospital, the cruise ship had sailed off. But the Wicks  —   strangers at first, advocates to the very end  —   stuck by the pair until they were well enough to return home a week later.      “It’s a sudden shock for people to find themselves in a foreign country, not speaking the language, not expecting to be disembarked from an enjoyable cruise and having a serious medical condition,” said Dan, a Californian who moved with his wife and daughter to Colombia in 2003. “We are here for them, to be a familiar North American face, helping with logistics, language and arranging to get them back home. ” The Wicks are good Samaritans of a specific breed: The expats act as wardens on behalf of the U. S. State Department. Their voluntary role in the consular services program is specific in mission (help your fellow Americans) and broad in services (do whatever you can to achieve Goal A).   “I am often called upon to assist U. S. citizen travelers who encounter difficult and often confusing situations that require immediate assistance, from stolen passports and money, incarceration for breaking foreign laws, political unrest, falling ill and even personal conflicts resulting in physical assault,” John Mackey, a   warden in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, wrote by email.  The program originated during the 1930s, when embassies relied on volunteers to disseminate critical information to citizens living abroad. The name derives from World War II air raid wardens who patrolled territories in the United Kingdom and United States. The service resembled a phone tree: Participants would knock on doors and ring up landlines to deliver messages ranging from administrative updates (absentee voting, Social Security benefits) to   warnings (evacuation meeting points,   shelters). These days, most of the 276 overseas missions can dispatch information electronically. Technological innovations have freed up the wardens to focus more on American tourists whose trips have taken an unpredictable turn down an unimaginable road.  “These people get themselves into trouble,” said Adriana Michele, a New Yorker who has dedicated more than 25 years to volunteering in Cartagena. The wardens can help them get out of it.    Community spirit Who are the wardens and, more important, how can you flag one down if you’re in a bind? Got a name and number? The wardens are civilians  —   emphasis on    employees  —   with strong ties to their community a la Mister Rogers. They are typically fluent in the culture, habits, layout and language of their adopted country. Elizabeth Gracon, a U. S. embassy official in Colombia, described them as “a local face on the ground. ”  Many of the volunteers have   jobs. Tommy Phillips, a   warden in China, is the   of Bread Rock Bistro, a popular expat restaurant in Yanji, in the northeastern province of Jilin. Jennifer O’Sullivan teaches yoga and runs a handful of bars and cafes with her husband in Siem Reap, Cambodia. Other wardens are retired or iced their careers to pursue humanitarian projects. The Wicks, for instance, left Silicon Valley to volunteer at a school in Cartagena and start a foundation. Despite the wardens’ divergent backgrounds, they all share a charitable streak. “They are Americans helping Americans,” said Christine Fagan, a division chief in the department’s Office of Overseas Citizens Services. “Also, the warden can give the local perspective. ”  Recruitment into the program is a casual affair. A consular officer might deliver an open invitation to join the warden network during a    meeting or an embassy event. Or a member might entice a friend to join the club, as was the case with Tommy, a veteran who explained that he wanted to “continue to serve my country however I could. ” Wardens are found in every country with State Department presence. The size of the cadre depends on the destination and its level of development. Urban centers with strong teleconnectivity need fewer volunteers than remote areas with primitive communication systems. Communities without a consular office nearby also lean more heavily on wardens.     State Department volunteer wardens Dan Wick, left, and his wife, Berit Wick, right, speak with physician Martin Caravajal at a hospital in Cartagena, Colombia, that takes care of many American travelers. The Wicks’ role is to help fellow Americans in distress. (Andrea Sachs   Washington Post)  “They can assist Americans who can’t get to the embassy,” Fagan said.   Because of the program’s informal arrangement (for instance, there is no training or manual) officials do not have a global head count of participants. But they can provide a snapshot of the warden census map: Lebanon, 90; Thailand, 73; Honduras, 25; Bangladesh; 23; Togo, 22; Chad, 18. Colombia claims 25 wardens, including four in Cartagena. I met the quartet during my October visit, but in arbitrary life, I would not have known their identities unless I had signaled an S. O. S.  So how do you, the American traveler, solicit help from a warden? You don’t.  The chain of command starts with the embassy. The tourist or concerned family members in the States will contact the office for help. The staff might resolve the situation   or an officer might notify the warden for assistance. The issue might be an easy fix, such replacing a stolen passport. Or it might demand a significant amount of time and emotion on the volunteer’s part. For example, if an American dies abroad.   “We know a lot more about repatriation than I ever thought we would,” Berit said. During last year’s cruising season, the Wicks handled the arrangements for three deaths. Berit still tears up over the memory of a Chicago woman who had been cruising with her husband three years ago when she became ill. She died while Berit was in the ICU with her.  An increasing load “¿Cómo estás?” the MediHelp hospital nurse asked. “How are you?” Berit translated. “I’m fine,” Richard Adelson answered from his perch on a padded chair. “Do you want anything from the minibar . . . like a Scotch on the rocks,” Berit joked, veering from the official script. The nurse brought Richard a small cup of vanilla ice cream, a welcome break from the infirmary staple of rice, rice, rice. The Adelsons capped off a very busy week for the Wicks, who also receive calls from the port agents about incoming medical cases. Sue Wright was the first patient to disembark, on a Wednesday in  . The ship also dropped off an Indonesian crew member with a torn esophagus. The next day, the Cartagena hospital received a District woman who had hit her head on a tree branch during a shore excursion and lost consciousness. An interpreter had accompanied the   cruiser. The Wicks had to juggle conversations in English, Spanish and sign language. On Saturday, the couple helped a German woman and her partner, who suffered a stroke aboard their sailboat. On Sunday, a crewman with a broken tooth arrived. So did Richard. “It was very frightening. I can’t imagine if I had been left in a strange country and couldn’t speak the language,” said Barbara Adelson, his wife. “It was such a relief knowing that there was someone to help us. ” During Richard’s hospitalization, the Wicks provided Barbara with an Internet phone, so that she could converse with her children in the States. They compiled a cheat sheet of essential Spanish words and phrases for Richard, including tengo sed (thirsty) dolor (pain) and pato (bed pan). They confabbed with doctors about his condition and translated their diagnoses. And they called the Adelsons’   company numerous times, updating the agents on his recovery and submitting the information required for reimbursement. They also invited the family (son Brian later flew down from Philadelphia) to bunk at their   condominium. Amenities included hot showers,   meals and fast friends, including Sue and Rosemary, who were also guests.  “They’ve made me feel so amazing,” Barbara said. “I feel like I’ve known them forever. ”     Over the years, as more cruise lines have added Cartagena to their itineraries, the number of warden cases have ballooned. (dbimages   Stock Photo)  On Monday night, the hosts and their visitors gathered around the dining table on the balcony. The air was warm, and the harbor shimmered under the city lights. Dan said grace. Everyone uttered, “Amen. ” Then they dug into the spread of salmon, salad and mashed potatoes, and drained a bottle of wine. On average, the Wicks tend to about 60 impaired travelers a year. About   are American, and nearly half stay with them. They still remember their first case from about eight years ago. A young woman ran out of money. They visited her at her hostel while she waited for a government loan to fund her trip home. Over the years, as more cruise lines have added Cartagena to their itineraries, the number of cases has ballooned. When the couple moved to town, about a dozen ships docked here; now a staggered parade of 225 vessels marches over from October to May. Back then, they didn’t know much about medical procedures or the mechanics of travel insurance. Not so now. On the day the hospital released Richard, the Wicks submitted a    form to the insurance company. They explained to the Adelsons that the company would arrange and cover their travel expenses to Philadelphia. However, the process could take several days. A second option: Pay out of pocket and fly back tomorrow.   “I want him home,” Barbara said. “That’s wise,” Barit replied. The next morning, Rosemary, Sue, Richard, Barbara and Brian all boarded the same flight to Miami.  Emotional attachment Finally, a quiet day.  Though cruisers surged through town, there were no calamities or crises. I stopped by Adriana’s jewelry shop, which was thick with tourists ogling emeralds. She invited me into her office, which was tucked behind the maze of glass cases.  “Things were easier back then,” she said of Cartagena in the  . “There weren’t that many tourists. ” Adriana and Hortensia de la Rosa, her Colombian assistant and an honorary warden, receive three to four calls from the embassy a year. One   story involved a mentally unstable mother who threatened to jump off a building. Another involved a bipolar man who succumbed to the darker elements of the city.  “Some people have drug problems and hook up with prostitutes,” she said.  Hortensia joined the conversation and shared a tragic tale about a young man and his uncle, who had taken him on a   trip. The    who had cocaine in his system, toppled off a   balcony. His parents and grandparents flew down when he was in a coma. Hortensia helped them at the hospital, and later with repatriating the body of their loved one.  “You get to know them,” Hortensia said of the victims, “and you can’t avoid getting emotionally involved. ” The attachments tug in both directions. Earlier in the week, she had told me about a family from New York who were traveling in a van to Barranquilla when it crashed. The husband’s rib pierced his lung. Over the Christmas holiday weekend, Hortensia and Adriana tracked down a doctor who could operate on him immediately. During surgery, Hortensia held his wallet and clothes while waiting. Later that evening, she peered through the window of the recovery room. The American gave her a  . Hortensia paused the story and reached into her purse. She pulled out a crumpled letter. The typed note was from the American to the U. S. ambassador to Colombia. She pressed a tissue to her eyes as we read the note together. He wrote that Hortensia “was there to help my family in any way she could. ” He proceeded to list those ways. He concluded with: “That relationship produced real results for us. We will never forget. ” A few months later, Hortensia and Adriana received a certificate of appreciation from the U. S. Embassy in Bogota. The accolade sits on a shelf in Adriana’s office, framed and under glass.   A last look On my last full day in Cartagena, I took a break from the hospital visits to explore Old Town, a walled labyrinth of Spanish colonial buildings and festive plazas. When I left the medical center, the Wicks had been translating   instructions for the German sailor and were trying to locate a mandarin speaker for a Chinese crewman in the intensive care unit. I felt a twinge of guilt as I wandered in and out of shops and drank cup after cup of Colombian coffee. In the early evening, I received a text from the Wicks that they were finally leaving the hospital. We met for dinner at an Italian restaurant in Getsemani, a spirited neighborhood emerging from a tawdry period. Over pasta and wine, we reviewed the patients of the week. Dan showed me an email from Sue, who thanked the couple for their help and hospitality. He shared a message from Brian, who wrote that he didn’t know how his parents would have managed without them. Dan and Berit were touched by the gratitude, but they didn’t linger long on the events. They knew that as each case closes, another one opens. The next afternoon, they were planning on visiting a cruiser in a Barranquilla hospital. The man had pneumonia and no money. That was all the information they knew and, for their mission, all they needed to know.  More from Travel:   That rescue dog doesn’t need a home. He needs a flight companion to get there.     centers want you to be a flight volunteer   Still finding kicks on Route 66   Despite the Caribbean country’s name, Turks and Caicos is not a duo like Batman and Robin  "

Ruane,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161203001010/https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/after-pearl-harbor-this-mail-plane-had-a-new-mission-find-the-attackers/2016/12/01/34216070-a1f5-11e6-a44d-cc2898cfab06_story.html
","      The tattered Pearl Harbor survivor looks every bit of 78, with weathered skin, rusty bones and the faded “U. S. Navy” emblem the old bird got before the war. Gray from age and years in the service, the veteran of Dec. 7 sits with other World War II antiques, weary and in need of attention. But with the 75th anniversary of the 1941 attack this week, and commemorations scheduled in Hawaii and around the country, this survivor, like most who were there that day, has a story. The ungainly Navy airplane at the National Air and Space Museum’s   Center in Chantilly, Va. is one of the few original U. S. aircraft in existence that flew against the Japanese armada that day. Then painted silver and   with a bright green tail and red trim, it was an unlikely combatant. Designed as a small airliner  —   a “baby clipper”  —   it was unarmed and part of a unit called Utility Squadron One, which hauled mail, sailors and Navy photographers around the Hawaiian Islands. It had window curtains and a restroom with porcelain fixtures. Its top speed was just over 100 mph. With Pearl Harbor a scene of death and devastation that Sunday morning, Plane No. 1063  —   its insignia a pelican carrying a mailbag  —   was ordered to seek out the enemy. For armament, the    pilot, Ensign Wesley Hoyt Ruth, and his   crew were issued three World War   rifles. Their task: Report the location of the six Japanese aircraft carriers, two battleships, assorted escort ships and hundreds of enemy airplanes that had been involved in the attack. “This is going to be a   trip,” Ruth later said he thought. But it wasn’t.     An old drinking water kit was in the Sikorsky   flying boat that sits in the restoration hangar of the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum. (Jahi   Washington Post)     Lockbox keys also were found on the plane, which had a   hull to allow it land on water and wheels to come in on a runway. (Jahi   Washington Post)      years later, the Sikorsky   amphibian, with its boat hull for the water and big tires for the runway, sits in the   Center’s restoration hangar, a venerable witness to the event that helped create modern America. The Pearl Harbor attack, which plunged the United States into World War II, killed an estimated 2, 400 Americans, wounded about 1, 100, and destroyed ships, planes and facilities. “The fact that [Ruth] got out and got back is . . . absolutely amazing,” Smithsonian museum specialist Pat Robinson said last month.  The plane would not have survived an encounter with the Japanese fleet, which it did not find, Robinson said in an interview at the center. It was lucky not to have been shot down by jumpy American antiaircraft gunners when it returned to Pearl Harbor, he said. And it was a miracle that it was saved from the postwar scrap heap. “Somewhere . . . someone looking at the log books realized the significance of the airplane, and where it had been,” and alerted the Smithsonian, which retrieved it from military storage, Robinson said.  “It’s a huge deal, to have this here,” he said. “It represents American involvement in the Second World War. It was there when it started. ”   Indeed, the airplane has a presence, and the Smithsonian would one day like to restore it. But other historic planes are in line ahead of it.  The craft, constructed for the Navy in 1938 at the Sikorsky plant in Stratford, Conn. is big, with the two huge propeller engines built into the wing above the fuselage, a hatch in the nose where a photographer could stand, and   windows. Inside it, the curators found an old emergency water purification kit and the rusted keys to a lockbox in the radio compartment. The squadron was based on Ford Island, in the middle of Pearl Harbor, where the Navy’s doomed battleships were parked. Ruth, the pilot, who later lived in the Washington area and taught at the Bullis School in Potomac, Md. was in his bachelor’s quarters on the island the morning of the attack.    Wesley Hoyt Ruth, a pilot who took off and flew over Pearl Harbor after the attack on Dec. 7, 1941. He was 28 and serving in Hawaii when this photograph was made. He died last year at age 101 and is buried in Arlington Cemetery. (Family photo) (   Photo)  A seasoned aviator, “he could fly anything,” his son, Thomas A. Ruth II, said recently. A native of tiny De Smet, S. D. he was having breakfast when the Japanese planes came roaring in. He thought for a moment that it might be a drill, until he saw them dropping bombs.  “Then I knew for sure that we were in for trouble,” he said. He would survive the war, but a younger brother, Thomas, who was also a Navy pilot, was shot down and killed in the South Pacific in 1943. In videotaped accounts he gave over the years, Wes Ruth said he grabbed his coat that morning, jumped into his convertible and sped with the top down for the airstrip. “I drove as fast as I could because . . . I was concerned about getting strafed,” he said. As he neared the runway, the battleship USS Arizona had just blown up about a   away. Pellets of gunpowder ejected from the blast began to fall from the sky. “It was snowing powder pellets about as large as my finger,” Ruth said in a talk he gave in 2011. They fell in and around his car.  As the Japanese attack ended, the Americans wanted to locate the fleet from which the enemy planes had come. Ruth was ordered to go find it. “You take the first plane, the JRS,” he said a senior officer told him.  He got into the plane with   Emery C. “Pappy” Geise, 35, radioman Oscar W. Benenfiel Jr. plane captain Amos P. Gallupe and two other sailors, according to the Smithsonian.  Before they left, the senior officer presented them with three old Springfield rifles for protection. “We would have to shoot through the windows,” Ruth said.  He thought the chances of surviving were zero. The brightly colored plane took off and flew north, looking for the enemy. Hours went by. “Every second in the air was fraught with anxiety, apprehension, [and] anger,” a crewman on another search plane recalled, according to Pearl Harbor historian Craig Nelson. “If ever there was a suicide mission, this was one. ”  Ruth said he flew just beneath the clouds, so he could duck into the cloud cover if there was trouble. He flew 250 miles to the north but saw nothing. He turned east for 10 miles, then headed back south 250 miles toward Pearl Harbor. Still nothing. Although the enemy fleet was still lurking north of Pearl Harbor, Ruth and his crew made no contact. But then they had to get back to Ford Island without getting shot down by their comrades. Numerous American planes were mistaken for the enemy and shot at by nervous Americans on the ground, according to historians. Again, Ruth and his men were lucky. They arrived unscathed.  Following the attack, the plane was moved to a base in California and later handed over to the forerunner of NASA for testing purposes, Robinson said. After that it went into storage until its importance was noticed and it was given to the Smithsonian. Ruth died last year at 101 in Matthews, N. C. He was buried in January in Arlington National Cemetery. For his actions at Pearl Harbor, he was given the Navy Cross, the service’s   decoration for heroism. “Although contact with the enemy meant almost certain destruction,” his citation reads, Ruth’s courage, airmanship and skill “were at all times inspiring and in keeping with the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service. ” "

","        There is limited space to dry fish in Elmina, so they are dried on the ground. (Tomasz Tomaszewski)  Editor’s note: Quotes and captions have been edited for clarity. Elmina is a picturesque, historic fishing community dating back to the 1400s. It is one of the first European settlements in West Africa located on the   bay on the Atlantic Ocean coast of Ghana. While passing through Elmina, photographer Tomasz Tomaszewski was intrigued by the beautiful landscape and the coastal fisherman’s artisanal way of life. So he went there to document what he saw. Here’s what he had to say about his experience: It was some years ago when I was passing through Elmina on the way to a neighboring country, Benin, to take some pictures of an interesting celebration there. While crossing the bridge in Elmina, I was seduced by the view of the bay and hundreds of fisherman in their boats. I cultivated this image in me for months and months, and couldn’t get over it, so I collected money and a year later I traveled to Elmina for five days to take a closer look at this magical place. It was a very personal project. I wanted to experience a place that made a strong impression on me. From afar, the town looked like a big anthill, pulsing with hundreds of people, including children that were fishing. They catch fish and then sell to buyers, who then deliver the fish to bigger cities. They dry the fish themselves. All of the work is done in a kind of communal way with everyone involved, including the children. There is a fish market next to the shore where all negotiations take place. Hundreds of people buy and sell fresh fish there.  The people of Elmina are bravely fighting for their survival and existence as they face the increase of modern technology in the fishing industry, and despite the aggressive behavior of Chinese fishermen. They support themselves by creating small cooperatives, where profits are shared equally between the members of these communities. It is a   effort without any aid from the state. See more of Tomasz Tomaszewski’s work here.    Fishermen pull boats out of the water before high tide. Families fish and care for their boats together and share the income from the day’s catch. (Tomasz Tomaszewski)     The local fishermen use simple equipment and fish near the shore. This limits the size of the fish they catch. This large fish is an exception. (Tomasz Tomaszewski)     Women bring fresh fruit to the fishermen while they work the nets. (Tomasz Tomaszewski)     Kids play on the beach while they wait for their parents to return from fishing. (Tomasz Tomaszewski)     Boats are built in a Marina. They are made only of wood. No modern materials are used. (Tomasz Tomaszewski)     Fishermen work out at a local gym.

142027,217378,Trump’s emerging Cabinet is looking less Trumpian than expected,Washington Post,John Wagner,2016-12-03,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161204005809/https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trumps-emerging-cabinet-is-looking-less-trumpian-than-expected/2016/12/03/bf0949c2-b8bc-11e6-959c-172c82123976_story.html
"," Just two weeks ago,   Donald Trump appeared poised to assemble a Cabinet as unconventional as he is, drawing heavily from a band of quirky loyalists that included several from the fringes of the Republican Party. But as he moves rapidly toward assembling his roster of top advisers, Trump instead is pulling together a more orthodox GOP team than many expected, including a defense secretary nominee, retired Marine Gen. James Mattis, who has received solid marks from the party establishment ahead of his formal unveiling Monday. The emerging Cabinet has gone a long way toward mollifying some of Trump’s Republican critics, and several of the picks  —   including the wife of the Senate majority leader as transportation secretary  —   are   to encourage cooperation between the administration and GOP leaders on Capitol Hill. The incoming team is preparing not only to implement longtime Republicans goals  —   such as repealing the Affordable Care Act and cutting taxes  —   but also to push for Trump’s iconoclastic and controversial campaign promises on issues such as a border wall and trade. But the group and the   are also fraught with conflicting views over key issues including Iran policy, Medicare and immigration, raising the risk of infighting and fractiousness both within the administration and with Congress. Several of Trump’s early personnel picks were “more directly in your face, while others that have come forward since then are decidedly less so,” said Thomas E. Mann, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution think tank in Washington. “At this point, I would say the Republican establishment that was so attacked by Trump during the campaign is doing pretty well in shaping his administration. ”     Here are the people whose names have been floated for Trump’s Cabinet View Graphic       Trump, who cast himself as a   populist during the campaign, is also moving faster in the pace of announcing his picks compared with recent predecessors. The biggest test of Trump’s interest in broadening his inner circle still looms, with his choice of a secretary of state, one of the most important posts in any administration. Aides have publicly identified four finalists for the job, including 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney. If Trump gives the nod to Romney, long one of his fiercest Republican critics, it would send a reassuring signal to the party’s moderate wing and to the nation’s foreign policy establishment  —   a need seen as all the more urgent after Trump caused a diplomatic uproar when he broke decades of precedent Friday by speaking directly with the president of Taiwan. But the prospect of picking Romney  —   who called Trump a “con man” and a “phony” during the campaign  —   has already sparked strong objections from some of Trump’s   supporters. Richard Viguerie, a longtime conservative activist, said that he, like many others, considers a potential Romney appointment a mistake but can understand Trump’s thinking. “He knows he cannot fight two wars at the same time,” Viguerie said. “He can’t fight the Democrats and the establishment Republicans. They’re still a big presence in Congress, and he probably wants to make nice with them. ” Several of Trump’s more recent choices appear to have the imprint of Mike Pence, the vice  . The Indiana governor and former House member is   by the party’s conservative wing but has also served as a bridge to the party establishment.     Steven Mnuchin, a former Goldman Sachs banker and Hollywood financier, is   Donald Trump’s nominee for treasury secretary. He spoke at Trump Tower Nov. 30. (The Washington Post)   Trump turned to some of his staunchest and most controversial allies for his earliest White House picks, including former campaign chief executive Stephen K. Bannon, the former Breitbart News executive, as his senior counselor. Retired Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn, who during the campaign led “lock her up” chants directed at Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, was named national security adviser. Trump’s choice of Sen. Jeff Sessions ( .) as attorney general also seemed in no small part a reward for his loyalty during the tumultuous campaign. Since then, however, Trump has shown a willingness to put rivals and others outside his orbit in key slots. South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley (R) who endorsed two of Trump’s rivals at various points in the Republican primaries, was named as his choice to become the ambassador to the United Nations. And on Friday, Trump met in New York with Sen. Heidi Heitkamp ( . D.) who left the door open to joining the Republican administration. Another Democrat, Sen. Joe Manchin III ( . Va.) is also being eyed by the Trump team for a possible job. Other recent picks by Trump may be unconventional in some respects  —   they would be hard to imagine in the Cabinet of Jeb Bush or John Kasich, two of his primary rivals  —   but bring familiar credentials to the posts they have been asked to fill. For treasury secretary, Trump tapped Steven Mnuchin, a loyalist who served as finance chairman of his campaign. Mnuchin comes from a conventional place for recent treasury secretaries of both parties: He spent 17 years at the Wall Street firm Goldman Sachs. Likewise, Trump rewarded campaign booster Wilbur Ross with his nod to be commerce secretary. Like many others before him, Ross is a successful businessman; in his case, though, he is known for his investments in distressed industries. For transportation secretary, Trump tapped someone as establishment as they come in Washington: Elaine Chao, who served as labor secretary under President George W. Bush and held other posts in previous Republican administrations. She also happens to be the wife of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell ( .) a relationship that certainly cannot hurt Trump’s promised effort to push a $1 trillion infrastructure plan through Congress early in his tenure. Many of Trump’s choices will arrive with a history of toiling toward   Republican objectives that Trump embraced during his campaign. Rep. Tom Price ( .) whom Trump reached outside of his immediate orbit to tap as health and human services secretary, is among the leading critics of the Affordable Care Act, the signature achievement of President Obama that Republicans have been seeking to dismantle since its enactment in 2010. Betsy DeVos, the Michigan billionaire and conservative activist who Trump nominated for education secretary, has spent years pushing to expand voucher programs in several states that give families taxpayer dollars to pay for private and religious schools  —   objectives simpatico with Trump’s call on the campaign trail to expand school choice. And Sessions has established himself as one of the harshest critics of illegal immigration on Capitol Hill, a credential that should bolster the work of a candidate who advocated deporting millions of undocumented workers and building an extensive wall along the U. S.  border. Rep. Chris Collins ( . Y.) an early Trump supporter who is serving as the transition team’s liaison to Congress, said the Cabinet that Trump is building “absolutely” signals that the   will try to move swiftly on the agenda that he talked about on the campaign trail. “The people being picked to run the departments with jurisdiction over those issues, I think, are in   percent lockstep with his positions,” Collins said. Still, taken as a whole, Trump’s emerging team is far more diverse  —   in Republican terms  —   than many speculated in the immediate aftermath of a campaign in which he surrounded himself with GOP   such as former New York mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and former House speaker Newt Gingrich. While Giuliani remains a finalist for secretary of state, the prospects for both men to hold sway in Trump’s Cabinet seem to have faded. “I think Giuliani and Gingrich are just loose fruits right now,” said Douglas Brinkley, a presidential historian at Rice University. “No one knows where to put them. ” With the choices he has made so far, Trump has pleased or at least calmed some of his chief Republican critics during the campaign. Sen. Jeff Flake ( .) who was a vocal critic of Trump during the campaign, noted positively that Trump has added former detractors to his team, including Haley for the U. N. post. “We’re still not done. Still got some to go. But I’ve been pleased with some of them,” Flake said. That view was echoed by Sen. Susan Collins ( ) who announced in August that she would not vote for Trump or Clinton. “I think he’s made some good appointments,” she said. And Sen. Lindsey O. Graham ( . C.) who continued to criticize Trump after ending his own GOP presidential bid, took to Twitter to praise the choice of Mattis as defense secretary, saying he would “provide great leadership. ” None of which is to say that governing will be easy for Trump  —   even with his party holding both the White House and Congress. Several stress points seem certain to surface between the populist president and more traditional Republican members of Congress, assuming Trump keeps his word on some key promises. The GOP takeover of the White House, for instance, has emboldened House Republicans to pursue an agenda that includes privatizing parts of Medicare, the popular program for seniors. It is uncertain how that will square with Trump’s rhetoric as a candidate who sought to distinguish himself from other Republicans by pledging to leave Medicare and some other   programs untouched. While Trump and congressional Republicans share a goal of repealing Obamacare, there has been less agreement over what exactly to replace it with. Trump has only promised something better. Trump could also face resistance on his immigration plans from some Republicans who argue that overreaching will prove costly at the ballot box among Latinos, a rapidly growing segment of the electorate that the party cannot afford to write off. And there are bound to be tensions on trade, where Trump’s views are far more isolationist than what his party has long advocated. In some cases, Trump’s nominees hold positions directly contrary to his. Mattis, for example, recently told Trump that he does not believe in the effectiveness of waterboarding, one of the “tough” interrogation techniques the   has vowed to reinstate. Mattis favors working with allies to enforce the Iran nuclear deal, which Trump has vowed to tear up. The defense secretary nominee also reportedly has told colleagues that he understands the relationship between global security and climate change, a phenomenon Trump has said he wants to address far less aggressively than the current administration. Timothy Naftali, a presidential historian, said that he sees numerous tension points ahead, spawned from what he called “a marriage of convenience” between the   and other leaders of the Republican Party. “It’s not clear what kind of arrangement this marriage is going to need to keep going,” Naftali said, arguing that making campaign promises a reality will be much tougher for Trump than continuing to tout them at   rallies, such as the one he held in Cincinnati on Thursday. “He can go out on the hustings and have great big rallies, and then he still has to come back to Washington and make sausage,” Naftali said.

142028,217379,China blasts ‘petty’ Taiwan call with Trump,Washington Post,Emily Rauhala,2016-12-03,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161204005809/https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/china-blasts-pettytaiwan-call-with-trump/2016/12/03/a6e0881c-b8e7-11e6-939c-91749443c5e5_story.html
","          BEIJING  —   On Friday, President Xi Jinping told Henry Kissinger that he hoped for “stability” in U. S.  ties under the new administration. Nobody told Donald Trump. The   broke with four decades of diplomatic practice by talking on the phone Friday with Taiwanese President Tsai   a breach of protocol that could disrupt U. S.  ties before the inauguration.  The   phone call is believed to be the first time that a U. S. president or   and a Taiwanese leader have spoken since the late 1970s.  It left Beijing fuming and   the world over wondering, “Is this a   or a major shift?” The United States formally recognized the government in Beijing as representing China in 1978 and has pursued a “One China” policy since 1972, when   Richard M. Nixon visited China. But although the U. S. government ended official relations with Taiwan in 1979, U. S. presidential administrations have maintained unofficial ties with Taiwan, which has become a thriving democracy in recent decades. Beijing remains hypersensitive to questions of Taiwan’s status and is apt to treat any change in protocol or policy as a provocation  —   even if it’s just a phone call. A spokesman for China’s Foreign Ministry said Saturday that Beijing had lodged an official complaint with the United States. Asked about the incident, Foreign Minister Wang Yi described the call as a “petty” move by Tsai. “The One China principle is the foundation for heathy development of  . S. relations. We don’t wish for anything to obstruct or ruin this foundation,” Wang said. Experts predicted continuing anger as Beijing takes stock over the weekend. “This is a heavy blow,” said Zhu Feng, dean of the Institute of International Relations at Nanjing University. Many questions remain about the conversation between Trump and Tsai. The   tweeted Friday that Tsai called him, rather than the other way around.         But Tsai’s office later said the call was arranged in advance by both sides.  Analysts are divided on whether it represented a   between the two governments or a more significant signal about the type of foreign policy that can be expected from the U. S.  . “My guess is that Trump himself doesn’t have clue,” said Bonnie Glaser, a senior adviser for Asia at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “That he had no idea about Beijing’s neuralgia on Taiwan. ” Susan Shirk, chair of the 21st Century China Program at the University of California at San Diego, said it was an “impulsive” move and a “bad sign for Trump foreign policy. ” The call and Trump’s subsequent tweets raised fresh questions about who is advising the   on Asia policy  —   and how.  Paul Haenle, who was on the National Security Council staffs of former president George W. Bush and President Obama and is now director of the   Center in Beijing, said the incident showed the importance of Trump taking daily intelligence briefings, consulting with experts at the State Department and Department of Defense and quickly assembling a China team. Past administrations took a “no surprises” approach to Beijing, Haenle said. “The alternative  —   catching China by surprise on some of the most sensitive and   areas of disagreement in our relationship  —   presents enormous risks and potential detriment for this consequential relationship. ” That means damage control before Inauguration Day, experts said. That Trump is the   and not yet the president leaves Beijing some room to maneuver, said Shen Dingli, deputy dean of the Institute of International Affairs at Shanghai’s Fudan University.  “If he were president of the United States now, this could lead to a   of diplomatic relations between China and the U. S. ” “Having this mishap occur before he is president is better than having it occur after he is president,” said Glaser of the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “Privately, I expect Beijing to find a way to give him an education on Taiwan. ” In a separate development Saturday, the Philippines’ president, Rodrigo Duterte, shared details of a   conversation he held with Trump late Friday. According to Duterte, his plan to “kill all” the country’s suspected drug users and dealers  —   a plan that has been condemned by the United States, the European Parliament and the International Criminal Court, among others  —   now has the backing of the U. S.  . The campaign has left at least 4, 500 Filipinos dead over about five months.  During the call, Duterte said, Trump told him he was doing it the “right way. ” “I could sense a good rapport, an animated   Trump,” he added. “And he was wishing me success in my campaign against the drug problem. ” The comments, which have not been confirmed by Trump’s team, could signal another significant twist in U. S.  ties. The Philippines is a former U. S. colony that has been a close partner of Washington for decades. Since sweeping to power last spring, Duterte has repeatedly lashed out at his longtime ally, threatening to ditch the United States for China and Russia. In September, when Obama raised questions about the bloody   crusade, Duterte lectured him on colonialism, referring to him with a slang term that translates, roughly, as “son of a whore. ” In the weeks that followed, he made several surprise announcements on U. S.  military ties, calling for the ouster of U. S. Special Forces from the southern island of Mindanao and the end of joint U. S.  military exercises  —   only to backtrack repeatedly. But Trump’s triumph in the U. S. presidential race saw Duterte switch direction again. Weeks after railing against “uncivilized” Americans, Duterte greeted the U. S.   with an enthusiastic “long live” Trump. Duterte also mused that they might get along  —   because they both like to swear. The Afghan government said Saturday that Trump and Afghan President Ashraf Ghani had also spoken. Ghani’s office said that during their phone call Ghani congratulated Trump on his win and expressed the hope of further cooperation between their countries under Trump’s administration.

142029,217380,Donald Trump keeps confirming fears about his diplomatic skills,Washington Post,Aaron Blake,2016-12-03,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161204005809/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/12/03/donald-trump-keeps-confirming-fears-about-his-diplomatic-skills/
","     One of the chief concerns of   Donald Trump’s detractors during the presidential campaign was that the brash and notoriously   real estate executive wouldn’t be able to handle the delicate balancing act that is diplomacy. It’s one thing to make wild claims domestically; it’s another to inflame a fellow world power with a careless word or two. Today, a fellow world power  —   China  —   is inflamed. And Trump’s controversial conversation with Taiwan’s leader, which broke nearly four decades of protocol when it comes to U. S.  relations, harks back to another controversial bit of diplomacy: Trump’s first big foreign visit as the Republican nominee to Mexico. That visit erupted into a major political problem for Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto, and by the end of it, the two sides were offering different versions of what had happened. Similarly, Trump and Taiwan seem to be   about precisely what just occurred. Back in August, Trump claimed after a meeting with Peña Nieto that the they hadn’t discussed Trump’s plan to somehow force Mexico to pay for his proposed wall along the U. S.  border. Peña Nieto and his staff quickly differed with that account, saying he had told Trump that Mexico wouldn’t pay for the wall.   ”At the beginning of the conversation with Donald Trump, I made clear that Mexico will not pay for the wall.” https:  .   —   Jim Dalrymple II (@JimDalrympleII) August 31, 2016   A week later, Trump doubled down on his version of events and seemed to suggest Peña Nieto wasn’t being truthful, telling ABC News: “He didn’t say that. He tweeted that long after the meeting was over. He didn’t say that. ” Much as with Mexico, Trump and Taiwan are now apparently differing about precisely what their call entailed. China considers Taiwan a province, and the United States has pursued a “One China” policy since the 1970s. To that end, the leaders of the United States and Taiwan haven’t spoken, that we know of, in decades, given such a dialogue generally symbolizes government recognition. After news broke of the call with Taiwanese President Tsai   and the backlash began, Trump explained that it was Taiwan who initiated the conversation, and he downplayed it as a “congratulatory call. ”   The President of Taiwan CALLED ME today to wish me congratulations on winning the Presidency. Thank you!  —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 3, 2016     Interesting how the U. S. sells Taiwan billions of dollars of military equipment but I should not accept a congratulatory call.  —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 3, 2016   But a spokesman in the Taiwanese president’s office clarified to Reuters that the call was agreed to beforehand. “Of course both sides agreed ahead of time before making contact,” spokesman Alex Huang said in response to Trump’s tweet. Taiwan’s government also said the two sides discussed “strengthening bilateral relations” and talked about their “close economic, political and security ties”    all words likely to make China cringe and suggestive of a more   conversation than just a congratulatory call. As with Mexico, we can quibble about just how at odds the two versions of events are. Perhaps Taiwan did reach out first but there was some coordination before Trump picked up the phone. And Taiwan certainly has an interest in making the call out to be a big deal.      The Washington Post’s Jia Lynn Yang explains the backstory on relations between the U. S. China, and Taiwan, and the ramifications of Friday’s telephone call between   Donald Trump and Taiwanese President Tsai  . (Alice Li, Victoria   Washington Post)   Trump senior adviser Kellyanne Conway and potential Trump foreign policy adviser Ric Grenell said Friday night that the flap was overblown. “It was totally planned,” Grenell said. “It was a simple courtesy call. People need to calm down. The ‘One China’ policy wasn’t changed. Washington, D. C.  need to lighten up. ” But the situation raises real questions about who is advising Trump when it comes to diplomacy with Asia, as The Washington Post’s Emily Rauhala wrote. It also came just a day after the New York Times reported on building concerns about Trump’s handling of other calls with world leaders and his preparation level. And the stakes are considerably higher with China than with Mexico and many other countries. Even if it wasn’t meant to be a big deal, it’s clearly become a big deal to China. China has now lodged an official complaint with the United States over the matter, though it appears to be giving Trump the benefit of the doubt and blaming Taiwan. China’s foreign minister, Wang Yi, called it a “petty” move by Tsai. “The One China principle is the foundation for healthy development of  . S. relations,” Wang said. “We don’t wish for anything to obstruct or ruin this foundation. ” So the flap could just as soon blow over. But it’s notable that yet another Trump diplomatic call has turned into a sort of    . And for those concerned that Trump doesn’t have the discipline and knowledge to deal with the intricacies and very sensitive feelings involved in foreign policy and diplomacy, Trump is yet again proving their point by creating a needless headache over a “congratulatory call. ”"

"," Every four years, the Institute of Politics at Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government assembles the managers of the presidential campaigns for a deep,   debrief. It is always illuminating and generally civil, with occasional fireworks. Because the 2016 election was unlike any other, this year’s managers conference was also unlike any other. In the immediate aftermath of   Donald Trump’s surprise victory over former secretary of state Hillary Clinton, all the leading players said the right things. Trump called for healing and said that he would try to bring the country together. Clinton asked her supporters to give the newly elected president the space and opportunity to govern. President Obama, despite harsh words for Trump through the campaign, said that he would assure an orderly transfer of power in the spirit of reconciliation. But everyone knew or should have known that the wounds from an election that was as raw and divisive and negative as campaign 2016 would not be quickly healed. That especially includes those who were the principal antagonists, the people who ran the campaigns during the general election. At Harvard’s IOP, it all gushed forth, creating perhaps the most contentious session that this series of conferences, which began in 1972, had ever seen. The general election session was the culmination of the   conference, which was organized in collaboration with Harvard’s Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy. Earlier sessions plumbed, separately, the Republican and Democratic nomination battles, as well as one about initial strategic assumptions of the many   candidates who sought the White House this year. On Thursday night, the dinner included a lively conversation among media executives, punctuated by some dissenting interjections from the audience, about the role of the news media, a topic that will be a continuing focus of debate as the new Trump administration takes and exercises power. Overall the sessions were tame, until the final Thursday afternoon, when the   fury of the campaign finally erupted.   Hillary Clinton’s communications director, Jennifer Palmieri, aboard Clinton’s campaign plane on Nov. 6. (Andrew  )  My colleagues Karen Tumulty and Philip Rucker provided a full account of what transpired when the leading advisers for Trump and Clinton sat across the table from one another for 2    hours to offer a historical rough draft of how the general election campaign unfolded. The headline on their story described it as a “shouting match. ” (For the sake of full disclosure, I helped to moderate the general election session, along with NBC’s Andrea Mitchell and BuzzFeed’s Katherine Miller.)  What captured the biggest headline was an explosive exchange between Clinton’s communications director Jennifer Palmieri and Trump’s campaign manager Kellyanne Conway over whether the Trump team had run a campaign that had empowered the voices of white nationalists. Palmieri bluntly said Trump had done so and that she would rather have lost the election than run a campaign the way she asserted Trump did. Conway angrily stood her ground, denying the charge and contending that Clinton lost through her own inadequacies, as she and Palmieri spoke over and past each other. The combination of pain and resentment toward Trump among Clinton advisers was never much below the surface. This was an election that the Democratic nominee expected to win in what would have been a   event. Her advisers were confident of that victory until the moment late on the night of the election when their path to 270 electoral votes had been finally blocked by Trump’s breaching of the “blue wall” in the northern industrial states. They were devastated by the loss. Campaign manager Robby Mook’s explanation of why Clinton lost focused heavily on the intervention by FBI Director James B. Comey in the final 10 days. Mook said Comey’s twin moves concerning the FBI’s probe into Clinton’s emails contributed significantly to the outcome, noting that   broke far more for Trump. He also acknowledged shortcomings by the campaign, including a failure to produce the kind of support among key parts of the Obama coalition  —   whether young voters, suburban women or African Americans  —   that the campaign had estimated she would need to win. What Mook and his colleagues found difficult to acknowledge, in part because they were there to shield their candidate from too much blame, was Clinton’s weakness as a candidate and the hostility that she had engendered  —   fairly or unfairly  —   over a long period of time that hampered her inability to connect more effectively with enough voters. That will remain an important, if not fully measurable, aspect of what cost her the election  —   and it was something Trump’s team was determined to assert throughout the discussion. If there was pain and resentment on the Clinton side (along with some expressed respect for what Trump’s team pulled off) there was another emotion that emanated from Trump’s advisers, an expression of grievance born of an apparent feeling of a lack of respect for what their candidate had done after so many said he was destined to lose. The same combativeness that marked the election was on display time and again during the discussion from Trump’s side of the table  —   an   sentiment of  .  that will probably animate Trump’s presidency.       Donald Trump’s chief White House strategist Stephen K. Bannon decided not to attend an event at Harvard University’s Institute of Politics, but protesters took to the streets of Cambridge, Mass. Nov. 30, regardless. (  Gerzon of Jewish Voice for Peace)    There’s no question that the newly elected president scored a great upset and deserves credit for running a far more shrewd campaign than his critics contended throughout the election. Some of those who attended the Harvard sessions as observers said afterward that the Trump team demonstrated more competence and skill as they discussed what happened than some of the caricatures of the operation as the contest was unfolding. But Trump’s victory, however shocking to those who never anticipated it, was no landslide, as some of his advisers have claimed. He won 306 electoral college votes. While that is better than George W. Bush managed in both of his presidential campaigns, it is a smaller number than in the victories by Obama, Bill Clinton, George H. W. Bush and Ronald Reagan. Beyond that, Trump now trails in the popular vote by almost 2. 6 million votes, or 1. 9 percentage points, according to compilations posted by David Wasserman of the Cook Political Report. His breakthrough victories in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, which sealed his victory, were each by less than a percentage point and by a combined total of fewer than 80, 000 votes. All that became another flash point over whether Trump had won a true mandate. When the Clinton team said no, Trump advisers bristled in response. We won, they said. Case closed. As the campaign managers were delivering their analyses Thursday afternoon, Trump was on the road to begin a series of rallies to thank his supporters. He started in Cincinnati, and it was as if the campaign had never ended, with the buoyant   reveling in his victory. Chants of “lock her up” echoed through the arena when he mentioned Clinton, and he laced his speech with another attack on the “dishonest” news media. Outside the arena, protesters signaled their unwillingness to reconcile. So it should have been no surprise that, in the conference room at Harvard University, the tensions between the two sides were so vividly displayed. The emotions are testament to the deep divisions that will continue to exist and to the long and challenging road ahead for the 45th president and for the country he will govern. "

","         OAKLAND  —   California officials fear dozens may have died in a massive fire that swept through an Oakland warehouse where a concert was taking place Friday night. Nine people have been confirmed dead, and dozens of others remain missing, officials said. In a news conference Saturday, authorities said they expected the death toll to rise, but they did not know by how much. “We’re expecting the worse  —   maybe a couple dozen victims here,” Sgt. Ray Kelly, spokesman for the Alameda County Sheriff’s Office, told reporters. “We did not have a lot of victims go to the hospital,” Kelly said. “It appears that people either made it out, or they didn’t make it out. ” Drones equipped with thermal technology were being used to scan the building for possible survivors, Kelly said. Initial reports, however, were grim. “The drones were being used with a thermal imager,” Kelly said. “It’s very, very helpful technology. It allows us to focus in, and we can actually see the heat coming off of someone if they are alive. We didn’t see any heat signatures of live people. Not to say that there’s not, but the chances are very small. ” The   fire was reported at about 11:30 p. m. Friday at a building off 31st Avenue and International Boulevard, about three miles outside of downtown Oakland, according to the Oakland Police Department.  The fire broke out during a party featuring musician Golden Donna’s 100% Silk West Coast Tour. Oakland Fire Chief Teresa   told The Washington Post that more than 50 people were inside the building, a warehouse known as the Oakland Ghost Ship that served as a venue for artist exhibits and parties. The city planning and building department had previously investigated the warehouse due to complaints about trash outside the property and illegal internal structures built inside the warehouse, said Darin Ranelletti, the department’s director. Complaints had been filed about the building as recently as November. Ranelletti said authorities are still investigating whether people were living in the building. Due to the building’s zoning, neither habitation nor a concert would have been legal without permits. The building’s interior featured a tangled network of antique furniture, artwork, musical instruments, wooden lofts, tapestries and oddities, such as mannequin parts, according to a Tumblr blog that appears to show the building. “It was a labyrinth,” said Mark Hoffman, deputy chief of the Oakland Fire Department. The concert was being held on a second floor, where most of the nine bodies were later found. By the time firefighters arrived at the scene, the staircase to the second floor had burned away, Hoffman said. The building’s instability slowed the recovery effort on Saturday. Officials said the building’s roof had collapsed onto the second floor and, in many areas, the first floor as well. Firefighters and structural engineers spent much of the day shoring up the structure so it was safe to enter the building and recover the bodies. Authorities said it wasn’t clear whether electrical issues, pyrotechnics, or errant candles or cigarettes had started the fire, and that an arson investigation would also be underway. Fire officials said the building did not have sprinklers. The fire is not being investigated as a crime, Officer Johnna Watson, a spokeswoman for the Oakland Police Department, said Saturday. Officials asked for patience and respect for the victims’ families as they investigate the many questions that remain, including the fire’s cause, the building’s history, and whether the party’s attendance exceeded its maximum occupancy. At a news conference on Saturday, Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf said she had met earlier that day with a “roomful” of people who were missing loved ones. “This is a devastating scene. This is complicated and it is going to take us time to do the methodical, thorough and professional investigation that these families deserve to find out what in fact happened,” she said. The majority of those inside the building were young people, some of whom were from outside the Bay Area or the United States, Kelly told reporters.      A fire broke out at a warehouse in Oakland, Calif. where a concert was taking place on the night of Dec. 2, killing at least nine people. At least 25 people are reported missing. (Oakland Fire Dept.)   The event’s Facebook page filled with inquiries on Saturday from people looking for their loved ones or offering their assistance to families and friends of the victims. Friends and family members of the concert goers also cobbled together a list of missing people in a shared Google docs spreadsheet, along with identifying features and contact numbers. Forty names were listed on the spreadsheet as of Saturday evening; seven were marked either safe or in the hospital.   said fire officials will verify those names against the ones they have compiled. “This is pretty tragic for us,”   said. “It is hitting this community pretty hard. I don’t even want to talk about how the families and friends are feeling. We have a community that’s hurting. ” The warehouse is located on 31st Avenue, a short block off Interstate Boulevard, one of the main thoroughfares in East Oakland’s Fruitvale neighborhood. The building itself was considered to be an “artist collective,” as city officials put it, with spaces there for artists to work. “It was beautiful,” Pete Veilleux, friend to several of the building’s residents and the owner of a nearby native plant nursery called East Bay Wilds, said. “It was like an art gallery, but people lived there. ” Veilleux was walking with his    dog, Lucy, hoping to get updates on the status of the people he knew who lived there. He was relieved to learn that some of them had made it out all right, but still didn’t know what had happened to everyone. He said he visited the space often, but never attended parties that were hosted there, like the one that took place Friday night. “I’ve been there before the parties and after the parties, but I wasn’t that into big parties,” he said. “I didn’t go to the events because I don’t like big parties. ” Such parties are a common part of the Oakland community, which features an eclectic underground club and music scene. Joel Shanahan, a   electronic dance musician whose stage name is Golden Donna and who was headlining the concert, survived the fire, according to the artist’s Facebook page. “Joel is safe but like many people he is heartbroken and has several friends among the missing,” according to a Facebook post. At least two organizations, the Oakland A’s and  Gray Area Foundation, set up online relief funds for the victims. More than $50, 000 had been raised as of Saturday evening. The Golden State Warriors planned to hold a moment of silence to honor the victims from the fire before Saturday night’s game against the Phoenix Suns at nearby Oracle Arena. A total of 72 firefighters responded to the fire,   said. Crews had to fight the blaze from outside because it was too hot and intense for firefighters to go inside the building, she said. Battalion Chief Lisa Baker said three sides of the building were on fire, the San Jose Mercury News reported.  A large blaze and thick smoke was seen coming from the building at about 3 a. m. Saturday. Watson, of the Oakland Police Department, said investigators have talked to people who either left the building before the fire broke out, or were able to escape. She declined to share further details.   said this is the worst fire the city has seen since the Oakland hills firestorm that killed 25 people in 1991. That fire, which rapidly spread through the Oakland hills wiped out nearly 3, 500 homes, according to the San Francisco Chronicle. City officials made it clear it will take time for a full investigation and    mission to be completed. Kelly said it would take “a minimum of 48 hours” to recover all the bodies within the structure. News like that won’t be much comfort to people like Danetta Logan. A postal worker with a route starting on 69th street, a few miles east of the warehouse, Logan was on the scene hoping to find a woman on her route, Mary Canteras, who she said had been alone and searching for her missing    daughter since 4 a. m. “I came here hoping to see her because she’s been out here by herself,” said Logan, who was in uniform. “I talked to her, and she was out here and her phone was going dead, so I’m sitting here hoping she calls back. ” While police couldn’t confirm there were any minors present at the party, there appeared to be at least one, which was what made Logan most upset about the entire tragedy. “That’s the biggest problem with this,” he said. “Just a lot of babies that got let in. ”  Bontemps reported from Oakland. Swanson and Guerra reported from Washington.

"," On the first stop of his “thank you” tour in Ohio on Thursday,   Donald Trump hit replay on several of his campaign tropes. Among the crowd pleasers, he heckled the “crooked media,” prompting boos from the audience, and reiterated his pledge to criminalize flag burning. And he’s not even president yet. More than a month and a half away from Inauguration Day, Trump’s only discipline seems to be making good on bad faith. His attacks both on the media and on those who, rather rarely, burn an American flag, are fundamentally assaults on the Constitution and the First Amendment. Do Trump followers really not care about these founding documents and their bearing on all the freedoms we take for granted? Or, could they really not know any better?  Most disturbing is the absence of objections from the right. Where are the Republicans when the leader of their party speaks so dismissively toward our principles of freedom and the journalists, many of whom they know personally, who practice in good faith the spirit of the law? How long before Trump’s words persuade some   Second Amendment “patriot” to take out a “crooked” media person, fully expecting to be applauded by the  ?  We the people believe in free speech and a free press not so that we can burn flags but so that we can expose government corruption, protest oppression and express opinions that others may find disagreeable without fear of repercussion. As offensive as flag burning is to patriotic Americans, it also can be an act of patriotism, a proposition I offer as argument, not endorsement. If you love your country and fear that it’s being led toward tyranny, you might well burn a flag to demonstrate such concerns. To the extent that the flag is a symbol of freedom, burning it is also a symbolic act. I would argue that many if not most veterans, including those in my family, fought, suffered and died for the right of all Americans to speak freely.  Indeed, it is the objectionable expression that is the true test of the strength of our freedoms. We don’t need a First Amendment to protect   cards or love letters. We don’t need it to protect Christmas carols. But should someone challenge the latter, given its religious content, wouldn’t many of those Ohioans cheering Trump’s demagogic illogic be grateful that free speech protects their right to stroll the streets singing songs of praise? Understanding the crucial importance of free speech and a free press to all other freedoms compelled the Supreme Court to rule that even flag burning is protected. And this is why Trump, a man who professes to love freedom and has presented himself as the best person to lead the free world, should be roundly condemned for suggesting that anyone who burns a flag should be punished by imprisonment or even loss of citizenship. Or why his persistent attacks on the media, threatening to restrict press freedom, are so misplaced, potentially dangerous and, not least, impossible for him to do constitutionally. Either Trump knows this, which makes his   not only offensive but also irresponsible, or he’s unfamiliar with the Constitution, the defense of which is one of the primary functions of the presidency. As to the crooked media, Trump’s gibes are patently ludicrous. Was he  ? Perhaps, but he was early on the Republican   and subsequently the nominee. The media could hardly ignore him, much as many of us would have liked to. Yes, some members of the media are biased, but not most, and they’re usually drummed out through peer review.  It should be obvious that without the   mainstream media, especially newspapers such as the New York Times and The Post, no one would know anything that has any basis in objective fact  —   and yes there is such a thing. We will rue the day we forgot that newsgathering is a profession with demanding standards regarding performance and ethics. Notwithstanding the   global newsroom, it’s nice to have smart,   experienced reporters and editors to pluck the pearls from the muck. Therefore, the highest service the president of the United States could perform would be to actively engage the media in the national interest of nurturing an informed populace, without which a democratic Republic cannot long survive.  To do otherwise is the first act of the dictator.  Read more from Kathleen Parker’s archive, follow her on Twitter or find her on Facebook.

"," Welcome to  —   brace yourself for  —   the   presidency. “Facts are stubborn things,” said John Adams in 1770, defending British soldiers accused in the Boston Massacre, “and whatever may be our wishes, our inclinations, or the dictates of our passion, they cannot alter the state of facts and evidence. ” Or so we thought, until we elected to the presidency a man consistently heedless of truth and impervious to  . Oxford Dictionaries last month selected    —   “relating to or denoting circumstances in which objective facts are less influential in shaping public opinion than appeals to emotion and personal belief”  —   as the international word of the year, and for good reason.  The practice of    —   untrue assertion piled on untrue assertion  —   helped get Donald Trump to the White House. The more untruths he told, the more supporters rewarded him for, as they saw it, telling it like it is.  As Politico’s Susan Glasser wrote in a sobering assessment of election coverage for the Brookings Institution, “Even   perhaps the most untruthful candidate of our lifetime didn’t work; the more news outlets did it, the less the facts resonated. ”  Indeed, Hannah Arendt, writing in 1967, presciently explained the basis for this phenomenon: “Since the liar is free to fashion his ‘facts’ to fit the profit and pleasure, or even the mere expectations, of his audience, the chances are that he will be more persuasive than the truth teller. ”  So there is no reason to think Trump is about to suddenly  . Indeed, all signs are to the contrary  —   most glaringly Trump’s    tweet that “I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally. ”  Trump and his aides are not embarrassed by their    —   they embrace it. Three data points from last week: First,   Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski at Harvard University, making the astonishing assertion that the media’s failing during the campaign was not that it scorned Trump  —   it was that it believed him. “You guys took everything that Donald Trump said so literally,” he said. “The American people didn’t. They understood it. They understood that sometimes  —   when you have a conversation with people . . . you’re going to say things, and sometimes you don’t have all the facts to back it up. ” Second, this   assertion from Trump   commentator Scottie Nell Hughes on the Diane Rehm Show: “People that say that facts are facts  —   they’re not really facts . . . there’s no such thing, unfortunately, anymore of facts. And so Mr. Trump’s tweet amongst a certain crowd . . . are truth. ”  Finally, the   himself, who at a rally to celebrate his successful bribing of Carrier to keep some jobs in the United States, explained that he was impelled to act by a   supporter who had been naive enough to take Trump’s promises seriously.  Watching the evening news, Trump said, he saw the Carrier worker say “‘No, we’re not leaving, because Donald Trump promised us that we’re not leaving,’ and I never thought I made that promise. Not with Carrier. ” Then, Trump said, “they played my statement, and I said, ‘Carrier will never leave.’ But that was a euphemism. I was talking about Carrier like all other companies from here on in. ” This was a telling moment, and not just because Trump doesn’t quite understand what euphemism means. The episode simultaneously shows Trump, confronted with Trump on tape, willing to recognize reality and Trump telling us straightforwardly that his promises are not to be taken seriously. They are truthphemisms.  Of course, Trump is not the first   president. Ronald Reagan famously insisted on repeating tall tales; he conflated Hollywood with reality. “If you tell the same story five times it’s true,” said White House press secretary Larry Speakes.   And Arendt reminded us a   century ago about the inherent tensions between   and political power: “No one has ever doubted that truth and politics are on rather bad terms with each other, and no one, as far as I know, has ever counted truthfulness among the political virtues. ”  But today we have the conjunction of a president unconstrained by facts with a media environment both siloed into partisan echo chambers and polluted by fake news. This development poses an urgent challenge  —   for journalism and for democracy. The journalist’s challenge is not to tire in refuting the torrent of lies. The citizen’s challenge is to remain vigilant against the enticing lure of   politics, to recall the admonition of our second president even as our 45th seeks to prove his wisdom an outmoded relic of a    era.

"," The word “inappropriate” is increasingly used inappropriately. It is useful to describe departures from good manners and other social norms, such as wearing white after Labor Day and using the salad fork with the entree. But the adjective has become a splatter of verbal fudge, a weasel word falsely suggesting measured seriousness. Its misty imprecision does not disguise but advertises the user’s moral obtuseness.  A French court has demonstrated how “inappropriate” can be an   device of intellectual evasion and moral cowardice. The court said it is inappropriate to do something that might disturb people who killed their unborn babies for reasons that were, shall we say, inappropriate. Prenatal genetic testing enables pregnant women to be apprised of a variety of problems with their unborn babies, including Down syndrome. It is a congenital condition resulting from a chromosomal defect that causes varying degrees of mental disability and some physical abnormalities, such as low muscle tone, small stature, flatness of the back of the head and an upward slant to the eyes. Within living memory, Down syndrome people were called Mongoloids. Now they are included in the category called “special needs” people. What they most need is nothing special. It is for people to understand their aptitudes, and to therefore quit killing them in utero. Down syndrome, although not common, is among the most common congenital anomalies at 49. 7 per 100, 000 births. In approximately 90 percent of instances when prenatal genetic testing reveals Down syndrome, the baby is aborted. Cleft lips or palates, which occur in 72. 6 per 100, 000 births, also can be diagnosed in utero and sometimes are the reason a baby is aborted.  In 2014, in conjunction with World Down Syndrome Day (March 21) the Global Down Syndrome Foundation prepared a   video titled “Dear Future Mom” to assuage the anxieties of pregnant women who have learned that they are carrying a Down syndrome baby. More than 7 million people have seen the video online in which one such woman says, “I’m scared: What kind of life will my child have?” Down syndrome children from many nations tell the woman that her child will hug, speak, go to school, tell you he loves you and “can be happy, just like I am  —   and you’ll be happy, too. ” The French state is not happy about this. The court has ruled that the video is  —   wait for it  —   “inappropriate” for French television. The court upheld a ruling in which the French Broadcasting Council had banned the video as a commercial. The court said the video’s depiction of happy Down syndrome children was “likely to disturb the conscience of women who had lawfully made different personal life choices. ” So, what happens on campuses does not stay on campuses. There, in many nations, sensitivity bureaucracies have been enforcing the relatively new entitlement to be shielded from whatever might disturb, even inappropriate jokes. And now this rapidly metastasizing right has come to this: A video that accurately communicates a truthful proposition  —   that Down syndrome people can be happy and give happiness  —   should be suppressed because some people might become ambivalent, or morally queasy, about having chosen to extinguish such lives because . . .   This is why the video giving facts about Down syndrome people is so subversive of the flaccid consensus among those who say aborting a baby is of no more moral significance than removing a tumor from a stomach. Pictures persuade. Today’s improved prenatal sonograms make graphic the fact that the moving fingers and beating heart are not mere “fetal material. ” They are a baby. Toymaker   children’s apparel manufacturer OshKosh, McDonald’s and Target have featured Down syndrome children in ads that the French court would probably ban from television. The court has said, in effect, that the lives of Down syndrome people  —   and by inescapable implication, the lives of many other disabled people  —   matter less than the serenity of people who have acted on one or more of three vicious principles: That the lives of the disabled are not worth living. Or that the lives of the disabled are of negligible value next to the desire of parents to have a child who has no special, meaning inconvenient, needs. Or that government should suppress the voices of Down syndrome children in order to guarantee other people’s right not to be disturbed by reminders that they have made lethal choices on the basis of one or both of the first two inappropriate principles.

142035,217386,The Districtâ€™s government is a costly laboratory for the left,Washington Post,Colbert I. King,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161204005809/https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-districts-government-is-a-costly-laboratory-for-the-left/2016/12/02/4028d3ca-b7db-11e6-959c-172c82123976_story.html
","   The D. C. Council, having relegated the mission of   oversight to a back seat, has become a legislative laboratory for the left  ” with the resultant costs to be borne by District taxpayers. Let us pause, draw nigh to council chambers and listen to the scream of protest:   Vigorous oversight of D. C. government operations is essential to our being. ‰ Tis a duty we cherish above all. ?  Rather than actively overseeing the operation of city programs and services, our legislators seem bent on taking revenge upon what they apparently regard as a scourge of the earth: D. C. business. Of course, that s not the way council members would put it. They fancy themselves providers of social justice and economic security and defenders against the rich and powerful. They point with pride toward their legislative gems: a paid   plan and the recently passed   bill.  In truth, the  good ? in these measures comes in the elevation of the council s   as a progressive national leader.  Consider:   â —  ? The paid   plan provides 11 weeks off, with up to 90Â percent pay  ” the most generous such law in the land;   â —  ? The $15 hourly minimum wage will be among the highest minimum wages in the nation by the end of the decade. Yeah, our council is No. 1.  This is a win for society, ? enthused council member David Grosso (  Large) about the   plan. Oh really?  This much is certain: Architects of progressive ideas in think tanks are celebrating victories scored in their legislative laboratory, the D. C. Council. Of course, having willing lab workers such as Council Chairman Phil Mendelson (D) Grosso and Elissa Silverman (  Large) facilitates the experiments. District residents aren t the chief beneficiaries, however.  Under the   plan, which the council is expected to adopt next week, most benefits would go to residents outside the city, because the legislation calls for coverage of all workers in the city regardless of where they live.  Who s affected? Of the 531, 999 people who work in the District in the private sector or are   only about 196, 000 live in the city, according to Mayor Muriel E. Bowser s (D) communications director, Kevin Harris. The overwhelming majority  ” 336, 173, or 63 percent  ” live in Maryland or Virginia. Incidentally, those 336, 173 nonresident workers also do not pay the District a cent of tax on income earned in the city because the Home Rule Act bans a commuter tax. So how will the council pay for this generous commuter gift? Money in the government account from which   funds will be drawn must come from somewhere. It will be raised through an increase in payroll taxes imposed on D. C. businesses.   A win for society ?? Grosso, tell that to businesses and consumers.  The same concern about benefits and equity was raised in connection with the   boost.  Again, the winners? They are the 55 percent of the District s   workers who live outside the city. They get the raise, and their wages are protected from D. C. taxation. Oddly enough, Bowser supported the   increase. Facing similar circumstances in the paid   plan, however, Bowser reversed course.   This is about fairness, ? she complained in a statement about increasing the   payroll taxes to fund the plan.  If we are going to raise a quarter of a billion dollars in new taxes each year, then D. C. families should be the primary beneficiaries. ?  I ll try to say this nicely: Consistency in D. C.     remains in short supply. Which gets us back to where this column started: the council s penchant for progressive initiatives pursued at the expense of keeping a close eye on the government Examples? End the tax on tampons (Psst. What about the tax on shoes? ); increase the number of plants a marijuana cultivation center can grow; help the terminally ill kill themselves; force employers to schedule work at least 14 days in advance. As for knowing whether the D. C. government is operating efficiently, effectively and economically, better to ask a rock. Even when legislative oversight is attempted, as in council member Mary M. Cheh s (  3) investigation into allegations of favoritism in city contracting, efforts come off klutzy. Imagine, as in Cheh s case, scheduling a public hearing but closing it to the public. Sad, because the District needs an investigation into contracting practices that favor insiders and campaign contributors. Look no further than the Office of the Chief Financial Officer s destruction of courageous whistleblower Eric W. Payne. It was a dastardly act performed before the very eyes of council member Jack Evans (  2) the finance committee chairman.  But carry on, council  . A decision has not been reached, but a new sheriff  ” the next U. S. attorney  ” may be coming to town. If so, he is going to be recruited by Sen. Jeff Sessions ( .) who may be attorney general when the sheriff s name is sent to the White House. And the sheriff is going to be a Donald Trump nominee. Should this come to pass, the District could be in for a world of hurt.  Ah, but letting folks kill themselves was a really, really big win.

142036,217387,The national teacher shortage is a myth. Here’s what’s really happening.,Washington Post,Kate Walsh,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161204005809/https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-national-teacher-shortage-is-a-myth-heres-whats-really-happening/2016/12/02/58fac7d0-b4e5-11e6-a677-b608fbb3aaf6_story.html
","   Kate Walsh is president of the National Council on Teacher Quality.              Here’s something I’ve been struggling to understand: What makes the prospect of a national teacher shortage such an immediately compelling narrative, capable of spreading with the speed of a brush fire?  With almost no real data  —   because neither states nor the federal government collects the information that would be needed to pronounce the onset of a true teacher shortage  —   we witness the press, school districts, state school boards and even Congress conclude that we are in the throes of a   national crisis. At the root of this crisis is a New York Times news article  published two summers ago reporting on six school districts that were having a tough time filling positions (though all but two ultimately started the year just fine). Whoosh! Overnight the teacher shortage became real. That early spark was then steadily fed by news articles reporting that teacher preparation programs were facing unprecedented enrollment drops. Nobody thought it important to consider that teacher preparation programs had for years been graduating twice as many teachers as are needed. According to findings from the American Institutes for Research, over the past 30 years, programs graduated between 175, 000 and 300, 000 teachers each year, yet consistently school districts have hired only between 60, 000 to 140, 000 newly minted teachers. Instead, school districts have been far more likely to hire people who already have some teaching experience. Federal data from 1999 to 2012 show that only about 30 percent of districts’ new hires were straight out of a teacher prep program.  The blaze reached new heights in September with a report from the Learning Policy Institute (LPI) producing a scary chart showing a widening gap between teacher supply and demand over the next five years. But tweaking just one of the assumptions made by LPI leads to results that are altogether different. If we project an average      ratio of 16 to 1 (which it is currently) rather than LPI’s estimate of 15. 3 to 1, voilà!: The shortage disappears entirely. What I find so frustrating about all of this is that we do actually have a huge,   problem with teacher supply and demand. For 30 years, most districts in the nation have struggled to find enough certified secondary science and math teachers. And rural and urban districts have been unable to tap into a reliable and stable source of new teachers. One answer to the problem is to pay such teachers more than others, but most districts continue to reject that solution because it is untenable with unions. We also could ramp up the availability of   positions for science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) teachers, but  —   again  —   few schools and states embrace this option because unions worry that districts will seek to replace   employees and their costly benefits with  . I’m inspired by what can happen when districts work smarter. Take Clark County, Nev. which faced a staggering 1, 000 vacancies at the start of the   school year. The next year, district officials began the school year with nearly 700 fewer vacancies. How? They got smart about recruiting and negotiated a higher starting salary for new teachers. They targeted potential applicants from areas with notoriously high costs of living, telling them how they could live better on a teacher’s salary in Clark County. State efforts to ease certification requirements and improve certification reciprocity have also helped. This is an approach that is eminently usable elsewhere. We could also employ   solutions. For decades, school districts have been awash with applicants for elementary teaching positions. That’s because teacher prep programs don’t see it as their job to tell incoming students they can’t all major in elementary education  —   that more of them need to consider special education, math or teaching English language learners, where there is real need. Unfortunately, higher ed seems to accept no responsibility for aligning teacher production with district demand. Given that teacher prep programs can’t operate without state approval, states could impose limits on production in some areas. The faux teacher shortage is of tremendous consequence. It routinely results in both states and school districts lowering standards for who is licensed and hired. But more important, it serves to distract us from fixing the chronic and persistent misalignment of teacher supply and demand.                "
142037,217388,What backyard birds can tell us about our changing world,Washington Post,David Holahan,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161204005809/https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/what-backyard-birds-can-tell-us-about-our-changing-world/2016/12/02/2a2fd1e8-acd4-11e6-977a-1030f822fc35_story.html
","   David Holahan is a writer living in East Haddam, Conn.     I love to watch the birds, but some days I despair. After meandering for an hour about fields, streams and forests, I often see nothing  —   or the equivalent: only juncos, aptly named, or common sparrows. I try to comfort myself with other natural sights and sounds, but my mind won’t have it. Where are the avian rock stars? Like those winsome warblers? Whither the preposterous pileated woodpecker (the real Woody Woodpecker)? If a scarlet tanager makes a cameo once a year, one is supposed to be grateful. But I am not. Most birders are not. We want action, color and sweet melodies. Worst of all, sometimes delightful species are about, but they won’t stay put for a positive ID, much less a leisurely look. The very instant binoculars focus on them they are gone, higher in the canopy or behind a leafy branch. They must think I’m going to bake them in a pie. Enter the   kinglet, a plump little royal that is blissfully indifferent to the presence of hoi polloi. Kinglets will pose in plain view, sometimes even flitting closer to their stalkers. Birds that are this accommodating almost always are the drab ones, or the usual suspects, your chickadees and titmice. The kinglet, however, boasts a rich palette of orange, yellow, olive, white, black and gray, all artfully combined in a unique design that makes identification a breeze. One once landed in a bush within arm’s reach, cocked its colorful crown and stared  —   as if it was adding me to its life list of curiosities. Kinglets are not common here in southeastern Connecticut, and that’s a big part of their appeal. Also appealing is their eminent inclusivity; they don’t seem to care whom they hang out with, often flocking with other species.  If spying a kinglet or some other scintillating songbird makes for a successful walk, does that mean uneventful sorties are a bust? Now that I am retired, I have more time not only to ramble but also to ponder such riddles. Why is it, for example, that I don’t note in my journal when I see bluebirds, but only magnolia warblers, indigo buntings and such glitterati? In fact, bluebirds are quite fetching, but they also are common hereabouts. There’s the rub. They used to be less so, and when I saw my first one years ago, I was smitten. Now we’re like old married people, barely taking note of each other as we go about our business. In full mating plumage, male bluebirds are a brilliant azure blue about the head and back and brick red on the chest, with a white belly. The females are duller, and juveniles have a mottled look. They will sit on fence posts for minutes at a time, like practiced models. I vow to pay more attention to bluebirds in the future. Bird watching is getting even harder because there are fewer birds every year. Two recent studies documented the decline: one, based on the annual Christmas count, reported that wintering North American birds are down by one third since 1966; the other predicts that unless conservation action is taken more than a third of North American bird species are at risk of extinction. We take the environment for granted, assuming it will take care of itself and will always be there for us. We rarely stop and admire the bluebirds, even if we are out looking for birds. We just experienced two years of extreme electioneering during which global warming barely came up.  One doesn’t have to have a position on climate change to appreciate that our species is having a dramatic impact on the environment, as well as on fellow travelers aboard spaceship Earth. It isn’t just the iconic animals of Africa that are in trouble. Even if we can summon the will to avert what virtually every scientist warns will be catastrophic warming, we nonetheless are leaving a   place for our children and grandchildren to inhabit, not to mention kinglets. Why would we do that?

142038,217389,Green Party switches strategy in Pennsylvania recount bid,Washington Post,Marc Levy | AP,2016-12-04,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161204005809/https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/green-party-drops-bid-for-statewide-pennsylvania-recount/2016/12/03/7b3b7482-b9b5-11e6-939c-91749443c5e5_story.html
"," HARRISBURG, Pa.  —   A Green   campaign changed its strategy to force a statewide recount of Pennsylvania’s Nov. 8 presidential election, won by Republican Donald Trump, and said late Saturday night that it will seek help in the federal courts, rather than the state courts. The announcement that it would seek an emergency federal court order on Monday for a recount came hours after it dropped a case in the state courts.  “Make no mistake  —   the Stein campaign will continue to fight for a statewide recount in Pennsylvania,” recount campaign lawyer Jonathan Abady said in a statement issued around 11:30 p. m. “We are committed to this fight to protect the civil and voting rights of all Americans. ” In the statement, Abady said barriers to a recount in Pennsylvania are pervasive and the state court system is   to address the problem. Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein has framed the campaign as an effort to explore whether voting machines and systems had been hacked and the election result manipulated. Stein’s lawyers, however, had offered no evidence of hacking in Pennsylvania’s election, and the state Republican Party and Trump had asked the court to dismiss the state court case. The decision came two days before a state court hearing was scheduled in the case. Saturday’s court filing to withdraw the case said the Green   voters who filed it “are regular citizens of ordinary means” and cannot afford the $1 million bond ordered by the court by 5 p. m. Monday. Green   efforts to force recounts and analyze election software in scattered precincts were continuing. The case in Pennsylvania court has been part of an effort spearheaded by Stein to force recounts in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, three states with a history of backing Democrats for president that were narrowly and unexpectedly won by Trump over Democrat Hillary Clinton. A recount began Thursday in Wisconsin, while a recount could begin next week in Michigan. Trump’s victory in Pennsylvania was particularly stunning: the state’s   electoral votes are a key stepping stone to the White House, and no Republican presidential candidate had captured the state since 1988. Stein had said the purpose of Pennsylvania’s recount was to ensure “our votes are safe and secure,” considering hackers’ probing of election targets in other states and hackers’ accessing of the emails of the Democratic National Committee and several Clinton staffers. U. S. security officials have said they believe Russian hackers orchestrated the email hacks, something Russia has denied. They have sought unsuccessfully in recent days to get various counties to allow a forensic examination of their election system software. Lawyers for Trump and the state Republican Party argued there was no evidence, or even an allegation, that tampering with Pennsylvania’s voting systems had occurred. Further, Pennsylvania law does not allow a   recount, they argued, and a lawyer for the Green Party had acknowledged that the effort was without precedent in Pennsylvania. The case also had threatened Pennsylvania’s ability to certify its presidential electors by the Dec. 13 federal deadline, Republican lawyers argued. On Saturday, a GOP lawyer, Lawrence Tabas, said the case had been meant “solely for purposes to delay the Electoral College vote in Pennsylvania for   Trump. ” The state’s top elections official, Secretary of State Pedro Cortes, a Democrat, has said there was no evidence of any sort of cyberattacks or irregularities in the election. Any recount would change few votes, Cortes predicted. As of Friday, Trump’s margin of victory in Pennsylvania was 49, 000, or less than 1 percent, out of 6 million votes cast, according to state election officials. Final counts were outstanding in some counties, including heavily populated Allegheny County, but state and county officials did not expect any outstanding uncounted votes to change the outcome of the presidential election in Pennsylvania.

"," BOSTON  —   Firefighters were struggling to put down a large fire that jumped from one building to another across a   neighborhood in Cambridge, Massachusetts, on Saturday. A large plume of smoke was visible for miles as heavy flames engulfed   residential buildings, including a former church that had been converted to condos, and several automobiles. Cambridge police spokesman Jeremy Warnick said seven buildings were on fire. He said some injuries were reported but none of them seemed serious. Authorities said Saturday evening that two police officers and one firefighter were hurt but that no residents had been injured. Fire crews were called in from surrounding cities and towns to help after the first calls came about 2 p. m. Saturday. They were still fighting the blaze long after the sun went down. Some witnesses said the fire started at a residential building undergoing renovations. Authorities said power has been shut off in the neighborhood and could remain out for most of the night. The city turned a recreation youth center into a shelter for displaced families. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

142040,217391,"In Mr. Pence’s new D.C. neighborhood, not exactly the welcome wagon",Washington Post,Ian Shapira,2016-12-03,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161204005809/https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/dc-politics/in-mr-pences-new-dc-neighborhood-not-exactly-the-welcome-wagon/2016/12/03/5a7ca0f4-b974-11e6-a677-b608fbb3aaf6_story.html
"," In the affluent Washington neighborhood of Chevy Chase, the tinsel, poinsettias and Christmas trees are competing for attention this holiday season with an unusual house decoration: gay pride rainbow flags. When news filtered out in late November that Vice   Mike Pence was temporarily moving into the white colonial with green shutters on Tennyson Street NW  —   in the heart of Chevy Chase, a liberal Democratic stronghold  —   neighbors decided to greet the Republican interloper with polite protest: rainbow flags flapping from their homes. It was time to Make Chevy Chase Great Again.  Now this isn’t San Francisco, South Beach or Provincetown. Most of the homeowners who ran out to buy the flags or ordered them online are straight. But in this neighborhood of oak trees and   homes, where 85 percent voted for Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine and just 9 percent cast ballots for Donald Trump and Mike Pence, residents wanted to make clear where they stand. “I thought it would send a message in an appropriate way. One idea was to put a ‘Chevy Chase ❤ Hillary’ banner, but we thought that would be too  ” said Joanna Pratt, 66, an environmental consultant who came up with the idea and lives across the street from Pence. Now, at least seven homes on the street boast the flags  —   a response to Pence’s opposition over the years to equal rights for the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community. It’s not clear when exactly Pence may have taken up residence or if he’s done moving in. Moving trucks arrived around Thanksgiving, and Pence was seen milling about, Pratt said. “My husband sees Pence in the bathroom  —   Pence was not in the bathroom  —   my husband was in our bathroom peeking out and saw Pence walking from the front door to a black SUV. That was the Tuesday before Thanksgiving,” Pratt said. On Saturday, she was standing outside on Tennyson Street, examining an “Emergency No Parking” sign tacked to a tree in front of the   home. The restricted dates: Dec. 3 to Dec. 4, from 2 p. m. to 5 p. m. Pence is only renting the place until he moves to the vice president’s residence at the Naval Observatory after   Donald Trump’s Jan. 20 inauguration.  Property records show that the home’s owners are Caroline   and Michael Kende. She is the executive director of the Africa Progress Panel, which advocates for development projects in Africa, and used to work at the World Bank and International Monetary Fund; he is the chief economist at the Internet Society, an organization that focuses on policy surrounding the Web. Neither could be reached for comment; neighbors said they live overseas. Messages left Saturday afternoon for Kathy Redd, the realtor who handled the rental listing, were not returned. According to Realtor. com, the house was going for nearly $6, 000 a month. At 2, 500 square feet, it’s a far cry from the    Indiana Governor’s Residence. Neighbors say they’ve been debating how to greet Pence should they ever get a chance. Pratt actually typed up a letter to the Pences and slipped it through their front door. “Dear Governor Pence and Mrs. Pence: On behalf of your new neighbors . . . we would like to welcome you to the neighborhood! Obviously, your schedule is very busy, but if you had an hour to spare sometime, we would love to host a   with some of your new neighbors. ” But Pratt didn’t shy away from explaining why they wanted to meet. “It won’t come as any surprise to you that many of your neighbors (including ourselves) have political views that are very different from your own. Nevertheless, we acknowledge the results of the election and would like to use this opportunity to set an example of how people with diverse views can still show respect for one another, especially by listening to each other. ” Anjana Tandon, 63, an accountant, was standing with Pratt outside the Pence pad and said she thought about bringing over her special pumpkin bread. “I’ve been making it for 30 years for Thanksgiving,” she said. “But I think the Secret Service would give it to the dogs. ” Just then, a white BMW SUV rolled up. “Are you the one I saw on the news?” the driver asked Pratt, who had given an interview recently on camera to a local news channel. “Well, great job! Good for you!” the driver said, driving away. “It makes me so happy. ” On Chevy Chase’s Internet mailing list, however, the protest was not universally embraced. “Wouldn’t it be wonderful if neighbors would respect the man, the office he has been elected to, and give him his privacy, and if anything, welcome his family, rather than hurt them by displaying rainbow flags,” wrote Linda Tavenner, a Chevy Chase resident who voted for the   ticket. “We should put aside political views and welcome him as a human being. People are so quick to tear down or protest against something they don’t agree with. Let’s trust God. ” Others on the email discussion group shared links for buying gay pride flags online or simply said: “We want in. ” Residents at the two houses that sandwich the Pence house declined to comment when a Washington Post reporter knocked on their door. This being Washington  —   and Chevy Chase to boot  —   many residents declined interviews, fearing their comments would upset their government employers, agencies that they declined to identify. But if the Pences are looking for Sunday brunch partners, they would do well to glance directly across Tennyson Street. There, parked right out front, is a Subaru station wagon, with a bumper sticker beaming for all to see in large red font: TRUMP. "

"," Three weeks before    Jay Gallagher took his own life, a worried friend who lived in Colorado sent an email to his school counselor at Potomac Falls High in Potomac Falls, Va. telling the counselor that Jay was saying things “with suicidal content,” according to a lawsuit filed in Loudoun County Circuit Court on Friday. “He’s usually crying alone in his room because he doesn’t seem to have a good relationship with his parents,” the girl wrote. The counselor, Richard Bader, met with Gallagher, sending the girl a reassuring response: “Talked with him today. Thank you for bringing it to my attention. ” But should Bader have notified Gallagher’s parents? That question is at the center of a $5 million wrongful death lawsuit filed by Jay’s parents, Erin and Timothy Gallagher, against Bader. The suit accuses the school counselor of negligence and ignoring school guidelines that direct counselors to notify parents if their children express suicidal thoughts. But Julia Judkins, Bader’s attorney, said the suit does not tell the full story. Judkins said that the teen told Bader not to talk to his parents about their meeting and denied that he was suicidal. “They’ve left out the fact that this young man was 18 years old and he had the right to tell Mr. Bader, ‘Please don’t tell my parents,’ ” Judkins said. Robert Hall, the attorney for the parents, said they had no idea their son was in trouble and believe they could have saved his life had they known he was suicidal. The parental notifications guidelines “need to be enforced,” Hall said. “This was Jay Gallagher’s only opportunity to be saved. ” According to Hall and to the lawsuit, Jay Gallagher was a stellar student and had been admitted to Virginia Tech. But unbeknownst to his parents, he put intense pressure on himself to perform well in school and was under extreme stress. Jay’s father found his son dead in his room Feb. 3. After his death, one of Jay’s friends, a young woman who had moved to Colorado from Loudoun County, reached out to his parents to tell them that she had emailed Jay’s school counselor to tell him of her concerns in the weeks before Jay’s death. “Last night was the most concerning due to the suicidal thoughts and the self harm,” the girl wrote in an email to the counselor in   adding that she did not believe his parents were “open to discussing issues or emotions. ” “I wanna say stress stems from busy schedule, lacking self worth and various expectations. ” Bader met with Gallagher, but never filled out the suicide screening form and never notified his parents. Hall argues that the schools’ Suicide Prevention Action Plan required Bader to follow those steps. Judkins disagrees. “Mr. Bader didn’t do anything wrong,” Judkins said, adding that their conversation did not meet the threshold for a suicide screening or parental notification. “It wasn’t applicable given the communications between Mr. Bader and young Jay Gallagher. ” The suit is a culmination of months of failed talks between school officials and the parents. Hall said the parents sought to clarify the guidelines or policy that outline when a counselor should contact parents and to ensure that all counselors were aware and trained on the guidelines. The Gallaghers wrote in a post on a Facebook page they created in their son’s memory that they filed the lawsuit “with a great deal of reluctance” and merely hoped to push the school system to improve its procedures. Hall said he asked school attorneys to meet for a confidential mediation session overseen by a retired judge and that the school system stonewalled the family and refused. But Judkins said the mediation session stalled because the family asked the school board’s insurance company to be present and did not lay out their demands ahead of time.

142042,217393,"Paul Ryan isn’t ruling out Medicare privatization, and it isn’t just Democrats who are wary",Washington Post,Mike DeBonis,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161204005809/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2016/12/02/paul-ryan-isnt-ruling-out-medicare-privatization-but-some-republicans-are-already-wary/
","     House Speaker Paul D. Ryan made clear Thursday that he is willing to pursue a major overhaul of Medicare, including changes that could eventually put private companies in charge of the health care for tens of millions of American seniors. But talk of wholesale changes to the popular federal programs has key GOP lawmakers nervous about overshooting their electoral mandate. “Save Medicare for another day,” said Sen. Lamar Alexander ( .) chairman of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions. “We want to begin immediately to repeal Obamacare. . . . Trying to deal with the solvency issues with Medicare at the same time falls into the category of biting off more than you can chew. It’s an important issue, it’s one I’m ready to address, but a little humility here would be in order. We can’t do everything at once, and we shouldn’t try. ” Ryan has long advocated for a major Medicare overhaul, one that would convert the    public health insurance program for seniors and the disabled into a system that would help beneficiaries purchase private insurance. Republicans tend to call such a model “premium support,” saying it is the best way to control Medicare’s   costs, while Democrats refer to it as “voucherization” or privatization and argue that it would mean less comprehensive coverage for vulnerable Americans.  On Thursday, Ryan repeated comments he made shortly after the election indicating that changes to Medicare would have to accompany any effort to repeal and replace President Obama’s Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. He spoke carefully about how far those efforts might go, but he did not rule out pursuing a premium support model for future retirees  —   a stance Ryan has held for years, dating back to his days chairing the House Budget Committee, and one that was included in his recent “Better Way” policy agenda. “We are going to have to do things to preserve and shore up this program,” he said Thursday. “The reforms that we’ve been talking about here in the House Republicans for many years are reforms that do not affect the benefits for anyone in or near retirement. But for those of us who are in the younger generations, the X Generation on down, it won’t be there for us if we stay on the current path. So we have to do things to fix this program so we can guarantee that it’s there intact for current seniors but also that there’s something there for us when we retire. ” Those fixes, he said, “are nothing different than what federal employees have: You get to choose among plans that are comprehensive and guaranteed to meet your benefits. Or if you want to stick with the current traditional program, you can do that as well. ” Ryan compared his plan to Medicare Advantage  —   an option for seniors where the federal government pays a private insurer a flat rate for each beneficiary rather than directly paying a health care provider for services rendered  —   calling that a program that “works pretty darn well right now, that seniors like. ” Ryan also repeated a frequent talking point, that “Medicare itself is on a path to going bankrupt” though he did not specifically blame the Affordable Care Act as he has in the past. The Washington Post Fact Checker has concluded it is misleading to say that Medicare would go bankrupt and   incorrect to blame Obamacare, which has extended the solvency of the key Medicare Part A trust fund by nine years.  What also has Medicare’s defenders nervous about a push for premium support is   Donald Trump’s intention to nominate Rep. Tom Price ( .) as his secretary of health and human services. Price succeeded Ryan as chairman of the House Budget Committee, and, like Ryan, he has embraced premium support as a way to roll back federal entitlement spending over the long term. Also on Thursday, Rep. Kevin Brady ( ) chairman of the   Ways and Means Committee and a Ryan ally, also told the Associated Press that premium support remained on the GOP agenda, though he said the more immediate priority would be “taking steps, small, in preparing for larger steps to save Medicare for the long term. ” Democrats, eager to seize on an issue important to voters that swung toward Donald Trump this year, have quickly mounted a fierce response to any suggestion that Medicare might be privatized. Sen. Charles E. Schumer ( . Y.) the incoming Senate minority leader, accused Republicans of “plotting a war on seniors” this week after Trump announced his intention to nominate Price to his cabinet. “We say to our Republicans that want to privatize Medicare: Go try it. Make our day,” he said. “We’re going to fight tooth and nail any attempt to privatize, voucherize or any   you can think of when it comes to Medicare. To Republicans considering going down this path, my advice is simple, turn back. ” The treacherous politics of entitlement reform is one reason several Senate Republican polled this week said that they were not eager to pursue major Medicare changes  —   at least not right away, as part of an Affordable Care Act repeal.  “My guess is, we’ll have our hands full doing what we need to do with Obamacare,” said Sen. Roy Blunt ( .) a member of the Senate GOP leadership team. “It’s fair to say that Obamacare’s done a lot of damage to Medicare. And because of that, it will necessarily become part of that discussion. But . . . I think it’d be a mistake to talk about specifics right now. We’ve got enough to do focused on first steps on Obamacare and we need to stay focused on that until we get that bill passed, and then we need to start looking at how you repair the damage done by Obamacare. ” Ryan on Thursday accused Democrats of trying to “play   politics, which is what they typically do every other Tuesday. ” That prompted Schumer to speak up again: “The people who are genuinely and rightly scared are millions of American seniors who don’t believe privatization of Medicare will be in their interest. ” Schumer and other Democrats are set next week to deliver a petition signed by more than a million activists urging Ryan and Republicans to keep their “hands off Medicare. ” Could Republicans, with control of the White House and both houses of Congress, privatize Medicare? They might have to in order to enact a Trump agenda that includes a major tax cut and increased military and infrastructure spending without exploding the national debt. One major hurdle would be in the Senate, where the are likely to be 52 Republican senators and it typically takes 60 senators to pass legislation of any consequence. However, major parts of a Medicare overhaul  —   perhaps the entirety of one  —   could be passed through the budget reconciliation process which reduces the threshold to a simple majority of 50. Compare that to Social Security, the other major driver of   federal budget deficits, which is specifically exempted from reconciliation and thus must garner 60 votes. The other major hurdle is Trump, who on numerous occasions during the campaign said he would not cut Medicare, Social Security or Medicaid, the federal health care program for the poor. Ryan and many congressional Republicans favor significant reforms to all three.  “Every Republican wants to do a big number on Social Security,” Trump said during an April 2015 speech in New Hampshire. “They want to do it on Medicare. They want to do it on Medicaid. And we can’t do that. ” “I’ll save Medicare,” he said in a Fox News Channel interview the following November. “You don’t get rid of Medicare. You can’t do that. People love Medicare, and it’s unfair to them. But while Trump has never endorsed any specific Medicare reforms beyond eliminating waste, fraud and abuse, the health care agenda posted on his transition website includes this cryptic item: “Modernize Medicare, so that it will be ready for the challenges with the coming retirement of the baby boom generation  —   and beyond. ” Ryan said Thursday he has not discussed Medicare with Trump, but he left the door open to use budget reconciliation to aggressively pursue GOP policies. “This is our intention  —   to use every tool we’ve got to make progress for the American people, to make good on the promises that were made,” he said."

","  BIRAN, Cuba  —   Not long after Fidel Castro’s new government began seizing farms and cattle ranches in a voracious expropriation campaign, his mother, Lina Ruz, looked out the window one day in 1960 and saw bearded soldiers in her orange groves. She went outside to confront them with a rifle. They asked her to put the gun down and call her son. Castro had nationalized his own parents’ land. Today the family’s former estate is a tidily groomed government historic site open to the public. It also serves as an unintentional monument to the economically ruinous changes Castro brought to rural Cuba, starting with the fiefdom of his immigrant father. Set at the foot of mountains overlooking a green sea of   fields 500 miles east of Havana, Angel Castro’s   plantation was a microcosm of the   rural economy that Castro’s revolution would go on to destroy. With its own hotel, school, doctor’s office, market, butcher shop, movie theater, cockfighting ring, pool hall and lumber mill, it was known as “El Batey de Castro,” or Castro Town. “His father wanted him to become a lawyer so he could defend his business interests,” said Maritza Hernández, who gives tours of the estate. “But Fidel had other interests in mind. ”   Fidel Castro’s   Martin Castro, 87, sits in his home surrounded by neighbors and other relatives in Biran on Nov. 29. Martin remembers the late Cuban leader as a restless child who enjoyed horse riding and hunting near his home town. (Mauricio  )  Fidel Castro died Nov. 25 at age 90, but he will not be laid to rest here alongside his parents and other relatives. His ashes will be interred Sunday morning at the cemetery in Santiago de Cuba, the country’s   city and the site of the hallowed tomb of Cuban national hero José Martí. Castro replaced the old order in which his father had thrived with a   Soviet model that became one of his government’s most chronic and costly failures. Cuba’s rural economy is so dependent today on horse carts and oxen that its farming towns look as if they’re drifting back in time toward the 19th century. Annual sugar production is less than 2 million tons, down from 8 million in 1989. The coffee harvest is   of what it was in the 1950s. Cuba imports some 70 percent of its food, and one of the primary tasks facing the next generation of leaders will be to figure out how to get the country to feed itself again.  Castro’s mother and sister Juanita never forgave their brother for ordering the nationalization of the family property. His mother died in 1963. Juanita turned against her brothers, worked for the CIA and fled to Miami in 1964. The only sibling who still lives near the estate is Martin Castro Batista, 87, a   born out of wedlock. Martin’s mother, Generosa Batista, was an    employee at the Castro estate when he was born. She was not related to Gen. Fulgencio Batista, the military ruler Fidel’s revolution sent fleeing. Martin hadn’t seen Fidel since 2003, the last time he visited the town, but he said he was proud of his brother.             Caption   Cuban revolutionary leader Fidel Castro died at age 90.   Nov. 27, 2016 Yoalli Aleida, 29, cries during a public tribute, where several hundred people gathered to honor late Cuban President Fidel Castro outside the Cuban Embassy in Mexico City. Rebecca    "

","     These bears were made from Blake’s uniforms. So very grateful these were made for us❤️ A photo posted by Elizabeth Snyder (@ejsnyder7) on Nov 29, 2016 at 4:22pm PST    A photograph captures a     boy clutching two teddy bears. One is wearing a patch from the St. Louis County Police Department. The other is stitched with police identification No. 4153, which belonged to the   ’s father, St. Louis County Officer Blake Snyder, 33, who was shot and killed in the line of duty. The bears, which were made from Snyder’s uniform, were given to the boy to remember him by. Earlier this week, Snyder’s wife, Elizabeth, shared the heartbreaking image on social media. “He’s been asking for his daddy a lot,” she told Fox News about her son. “Which is hard, because I don’t know how to respond to him yet, because every time I look at him, I’m reminded that my husband’s not coming home. ” Elizabeth Snyder, 25, told The Washington Post on Friday that every night before Blake went to work, he kissed her and their son, Malachi, and told them he loved them. Early one Thursday morning in October, she said, she got a call from her brother, who is on the tactical team with the St. Louis County police. She said he told her to get up and get dressed  —   Blake had been involved in an accident, and it was serious. She said she thought it was a minor gunshot or stab wound; she didn’t think it was that severe until she and her brother were driving to a nearby hospital. “We were about five minutes from the hospital when my brother got a call,” she said, sobbing, “and I could see it on his face. ” Her husband had died by the time they reached him. Elizabeth Snyder, who grew up in a family of law enforcement officers, said she and Blake had talked about the grim possibility, but she never expected it to happen.       Blake Snyder, a   veteran on the force, was responding to a disturbance call in the early morning hours on Oct. 6 when a suspect,     Trenton Forster, pulled a pistol and shot him “point blank,” St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar told reporters at a news conference at the time, according to NBC affiliate KSDK. “It was an immediately fatal wound,” Belmar said. Police said Forster, who was associated with a teenage girl at the home in St. Louis, had showed up at the residence, banging on the front door. The homeowner refused to let him in and called 911, police said. As Snyder arrived on the scene, Forster had reportedly gotten into his car; Snyder approached him and ordered him to show his hands, police said. Almost immediately, police said, Forster fired the fatal shot. Another responding officer, who saw the incident, returned fire; Forster was taken to a hospital in critical condition but survived. He has since been charged with   murder in connection with Snyder’s death, according to court records. He has pleaded not guilty, according to reports. In an emotional final radio call following Snyder’s slaying, the St. Louis County Police Department said he would be remembered by his comrades. “Attention all units: St. Louis County is announcing the final roll call for St. Louis County Police Office Blake Snyder, DSN [department serial number] 4153,” a dispatcher said. “The men and women of St. Louis County Police Department are forever grateful and proud to have served with Police Officer Blake Snyder and will never forget his ultimate sacrifice. “Police Office Snyder, may you rest in peace and protect us from above, knowing that your strength lives on in your wife, Elizabeth, your legacy carries on through your son, Malachi, and your honor will continue on with all of us. Police Office Snyder was a cherished member of the St. Louis County Police Department, and he will never be forgotten. ” So far in 2016, 133 law enforcement officers across the United States have died in the line of duty, according to preliminary data from the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund.   of those incidents were   it shows. Snyder was the 43rd officer fatally shot in the nation this year and the second in Missouri, according to the memorial fund. Belmar, the police chief, told reporters in October that although Snyder had not been with the St. Louis County police for very long, he had made a lasting impact. “I wouldn’t have to know Officer Snyder to tell you that he’s tremendously dedicated, that he’s an outstanding police officer and that if you ask him why he’s a police officer, he would tell you without hesitation, ‘Because I want to help people,’ ” he said.  Elizabeth Snyder said she and her son no longer live in their St. Louis home; she said it’s too painful  —   “everything in that house was me and Blake. ” But even without the constant reminders, she said,    Malachi knows that his father is missing. “About two weeks after it happened, he went through a phase of constantly asking for him,” she said. Now, she said, “when he sees a picture or we go to Blake’s parents’ house, he says, ‘Daddy? Daddy?’ and he puts his hands up and searches for him. ” Snyder said a family friend and fellow police wife had the idea to take one of her husband’s police uniforms and have it made into teddy bears for their young son. She said when Malachi first saw them, he said, “Bears, bears!” and then called out for his father. “He definitely knows there’s a connection between the bears and Blake,” she said. Snyder said she hasn’t been able to explain to her son why his father is gone. But she said she wants him to understand that “his father was selfless, and he gave his life for others. He saved his partners, he saved the people in that house, he put his life on the line for his community. ” “He just knows [Blake] isn’t around anymore,” she said, crying. “I’ll tell him one day. ”"

"," The question Participation in sports has been shown to help the heart and to have other benefits. Are some sports better than others? This study The researchers analyzed health and physical activity data on 80, 306 adults (average age 52) including the frequency and intensity of their participation in various sports. In a span of about nine years, 8, 790 people died, including 1, 909 from cardiovascular disease. People who regularly swam, played racket sports (tennis, squash or badminton) or did aerobics (including dancing) were less likely to die for any reason, but especially from cardiovascular disease, than were people who did not participate in those sports. The reduced risk for cardiovascular death was 36 percent for aerobics, 41 percent for swimming and 56 percent for racket sports. Cycling and running did not reduce the odds of cardiovascular death. Who may be affected Adults. Being physically active helps protect people from numerous chronic conditions, including heart disease, the No. 1 cause of death in the United States. Guidelines for adults suggest at least 150 minutes a week of   aerobic activity (or 75 minutes of vigorous activity) ideally spread throughout the week, along with   exercise at least two days a week. Less than half of American adults meet the aerobic activity guideline, and just 20 percent meet the   guideline. Caveats Data on sports participation came from the participants’ responses on questionnaires. The researchers noted that the analysis focused solely on mortality and did not take into account social and mental health benefits and potential reduction in disease incidence from participation in sports, including those that were not found to reduce cardiovascular death.

But, yes, I’m hurt. I’m very hurt!” I insisted. “This has nothing to do with my ego. ” But I hesitated as I said it and he smiled knowingly. “Tell me again, exactly what happened. ” What had happened? I had been blindsided. In between meetings I decided to kill two hours at the movies. I texted a friend who lived nearby to meet me, bought my ticket and was idly waiting for her to arrive or for the earlier showing of the movie to let out so I could claim seats. The door to the theater I was waiting for abruptly banged open and I watched as a guy I’ve been dating came hurrying out with a beautiful girl in tow. If he had glanced left he would have looked me right in the face, but luckily he continued briskly around the corner and out of sight. I tried to register what I had just seen. Had they been holding hands? No. Did I recognize her? No. Had he asked me if I was free this afternoon? No. My friend arrived and I spent the next two hours sitting in the theater in a daze. He wasn’t my boyfriend, I reasoned. And while we were seeing each other, I had also gone out with two different guys. But I liked him the best. I felt sick to my stomach. And sad. Weirdly, I didn’t feel mad because I knew I had no right to be. But as the day continued and I met up with my friend who was asking these difficult questions, the more uncomfortable I felt. “Okay, maybe it’s a little bit about him choosing someone else over me,” I hedged. “But still. We’ve been seeing each other for a few months. Does this mean he’s not feeling connected enough to me that he had to go out with someone else?” “Shouldn’t you be asking yourself the same question?” my friend countered. “Yeah, but that’s different,” I said. “I’m keeping one foot out the door to protect myself until I know where things stand. ” “Then how come he isn’t also allowed to do that? Why should you get to do whatever you want and he can only see you until you two decide whether or not you’re going for it?” I knew he was right. When I’m not exclusive with someone, going on casual dates with other people can seem fine  —   healthy, even  —   when I’m the one doing it. I’m just protecting myself! Keeping myself from getting too attached to any one person too soon. And yet, it seems abominable when I see someone I’ve become attached to out with someone else. “Listen,” he said, looking at me sympathetically, “If you’ve got feelings and you know what they are and the other person doesn’t, it’s unfair to hold him responsible for hurting them. ” I did need to tell this guy how I felt about him. So as   as possible, I told him that I had seen him out with someone else. It developed into an honest discussion about what we both were doing when we weren’t spending time together. The relief I felt  —   that we both like each other but that we’re still in the process of figuring out our feelings  —   was huge. And the conversation was far less emotional than I had expected. And because our conversation was so open, I actually felt a strong connection between us. We both realized that it’s one thing to assume that the person you’re dating casually has other people in their life, but it can be incredibly jarring to witness it. We’re still “figuring it out,” but we’re doing it by communicating more openly  —   which seems to be our best option.

142047,217399,The rules for setting your holiday table (and why they matter),Washington Post,Jura Koncius,2016-11-29,2016.0,11.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161204005809/https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/home/dont-disregard-table-setting-rules-at-your-holiday-dinner-party-they-still-matter/2016/11/28/d22accca-b1a4-11e6-8616-52b15787add0_story.html
"," Setting the table is often a hurried,   chore. But it’s the holidays; make it special. Mindy Lockard, an etiquette and lifestyle expert and founder of the Gracious Girl blog, says the art of table setting is an important part of her world. Many of our     traditions can be traced to   and   European protocol influenced by French and English aristocracy, and Lockard, who lives in Portland, Ore. gives lectures on why etiquette is still relevant in today’s world.   Q: Why are   rules still important?  A: We have rules for driving because it gives us a direction. Rules keep us from bumping into each other. This is what manners and etiquette do. They organize us and help us and give us a range. This helps us extend respect to others.  Q: Why should you put the fork next to the napkin and not on top of it?  A: You do not put the fork on the napkin because it’s an extra effort for people when they sit down. They would have to take off the napkin and reposition the fork. If you put the napkin next to the fork, you don’t have to navigate any utensil  —   you just grab it.  Q: And what about setting the table with napkins folded on the dinner plate?  A: There are a couple of reasons I don’t put a napkin on a plate. Your napkin may have been in your drawer for a while. Or it may have gone through the laundry and might still have some detergent on it. You don’t want something that might be on your napkin touching the plate you will be putting food onto.  Q: What are your thoughts on napkin rings?  A: I love napkin rings, as well as other things that encourage people to have fun with their place settings. Special additions such as napkin rings or place cards make people feel as if they are coming to something special. Think of other things to do at the table that incorporate your family or your traditions. It makes the evening an experience and not just a meal.  Q: How can kids get involved in table setting?  A: Let your children make place cards, and don’t get hung up about them not being perfect. People will appreciate knowing a child has been involved in that process. Also hand them [a diagram] and let them set the table. If kids enjoy being part of the party, they can learn a life skill.  Q: Are there rules for centerpieces?  A: Test the visibility of your centerpiece. Sometimes we don’t realize we cut off the eyesight of people sitting across from each other. The right height is important. If you create a wall down the table, you have lost the energy of your guests. Sit in a few chairs after you put your centerpiece down and make sure no one’s sight is being blocked.  Q: What about cellphones at the table?  A: There are times in our household when we do need to use our phones at the table. But if you have a guest in your home, I think it’s best not to. I suggest putting out a basket to collect phones when guests walk in for a holiday dinner. This will allow people to engage. The younger generation may scoff at it a bit, but they will also see they are happy once they are disconnected.

142048,217400,Their 5-year-old is aggressive and quick to blame. What to do?,Washington Post,Meghan Leahy,2016-11-30,2016.0,11.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161204005809/https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/on-parenting/we-have-four-children-one-of-them-causes-all-the-problems/2016/11/29/026b7bdc-b25e-11e6-8616-52b15787add0_story.html
","  Q: We have four boys, ages 6, 5 and twin   . The     is giving us a run for our money. He is a bright and imaginative boy but has a hard time taking responsibility for anything. His favorite phrases are “He did something to me first” and “If you _____, then I’ll _____. ” What most people would consider minor issues or problems tend to be blown way out of proportion for him. A stubbed toe could cause a crying fit for 25 minutes. If he doesn’t get exactly what his brothers do, it’s as if no one loves him. His sense of fairness is so black and white that we just don’t know what to do. He becomes aggressive toward his brothers easily and manipulates the little ones into teasing or excluding each other from playing. We went to a therapist last year. The conclusion was that his psyche was damaged and that there was nothing we could do to help the situation. I don’t buy that I can’t change my behavior or actions to help my child. Do you have any suggestions on how to help us help him?  A: “That his psyche was damaged and that there was nothing we could do to help the situation. ” Holy smokes. I don’t know a therapist who would say such a thing! Awful. In my heart, I believe that every child is capable of change. How much depends on many factors, but zero? No, I would not accept that, and I certainly would not see that therapist again. First, I know that I say this in every column, but you very much need to have a full   done on this child. Find a good developmental pediatrician and have your son assessed for everything you can think of: sleep and food issues, learning problems, sensory issues, executive function issues. So many times in our culture, our gifted, “bright and imaginative,” and sensitive children are not seen for the multifaceted people they are, especially when they are sandwiched into a large family. As you learn more about this    you can take comfort in knowing that the    thinking you so aptly describe is a hallmark of immaturity and childhood. The younger and more immature children are, the more black and white their thinking is. The essence of maturity comes when one can see that life is mostly gray. For instance, if your son were older and more mature, he might understand that he can’t get the same things as his brothers. He might say: “Well, it is disappointing that I cannot go to that play center today, but I understand that I am not as little as the twins. I have to go to a different area. ” It sounds as if your son is not there, though. So our basic mandate, as parents, is to help our children become as mature as they can, right? How do we do this? It would be useful to understand some basic   traits that can occur in families. Do not take these as gospel truth; instead, allow them to inform your understanding of your   . For instance, Alfred Adler, a psychotherapist who specialized in birth order and family dynamics, said that a second child might see an older sibling as a “pacemaker. ” An overview of Adlerian   characteristics developed by Henry T. Stein of the Alfred Adler Institutes of San Francisco & Northwestern Washington puts it this way: “There is always someone ahead. Is more competitive, wants to overtake older child. May become a rebel or try to outdo everyone. Competition can deteriorate into rivalry. ”  Sound familiar? Think about it. He is not the first son (who, I imagine, is a leader and bright and independent) nor does your    occupy the special space of    twins. Can you imagine how those twins came along and “stole” all attention and energy from you and your spouse? Of course your    is fighting for his place in the family. Everything feels fraught because in his young mind, it is. Everything is an opportunity for him to either win or lose. Every play situation is a chance to place his little brothers below him. You say, “He becomes aggressive toward his brothers easily and manipulates the little ones into teasing or excluding each other from playing. ” It makes sense, right? The    needs a place in the family, and he will belong negatively or positively. And here’s where it gets tough. The more he fights with you and his brothers, the slower he is to mature. He is spending all of his energy fighting for attention, and this is depleting the energy it takes to mature. A child’s brain and emotions become stuck when they are spending all of their time in panic and aggression mode. To sum it up: Your child is really stuck. His immaturity is hurting him, and he cannot mature because he feels lost, anxious, competitive and angry in his family.   What are you supposed to do? Well, you need help. Find a good family therapist or coach (who is not strictly behavioral) and work on positively bringing this child into the fold. Why do you need a therapist for this? As the parent, you will need loving encouragement to keep going because this road may be long. I could be wrong. Sometimes all we need to do is change one or two things and  —   poof!  —   the child is a different kid. But my intuition is telling me that this child has been in panic mode for a while. He is hard to parent, which makes your heart harden to him, and so goes the cycle. Does he need therapy? I don’t know. My strongest suggestion is that you begin and then take him. But that must be the order: you and then he. In the meantime, here are some explicit instructions: 1. Stop creating circumstances in which there could be competition between the children. I know, tall order, but get in there and put a quick stop to it. 2. Stop getting to the bottom of fights. Even if you know the    has orchestrated some serious shenanigans, skip over the blame and work on putting an end to said shenanigans. 3. In that vein, do not leave him alone with the twins. Yes, I am asking the impossible, but you want to help this child, right? If we don’t want him to get in trouble, we need to provide the conditions for trouble not to occur. This is the essence of parenting. We take on the maturity for the child when they cannot or do not have it. 4. No matter how many  boundaries you have to hold, let your    know he is a wonderful boy and brother. Take special time just with him. Find ways to meet his eyes and listen. Connect, connect and connect. 5. Stop all punishments. Timeouts, sending to room, etc. All are feeding his insecurity. 6. Don’t listen to anyone who tells you that this child needs more consequences or a “ . ” He is suffering enough; layering on behavioral strategies (right now) would result in a backlash that will crush him. Get help, ASAP, and don’t give up. He needs you. "
142049,217407,"Army will deny easement, halting work on Dakota Access Pipeline",Washington Post,Brady Dennis,2016-12-04,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161205004132/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2016/12/04/army-will-deny-easement-halting-work-on-dakota-access-pipeline/
","     The Army said Sunday that it will not approve an easement necessary to permit the controversial Dakota Access Pipeline to cross under Lake Oahe in North Dakota, marking a monumental victory for the Native American tribes and thousands of others who have flocked in recent months to protest the oil pipeline. “I’m happy as heck,” said Everett Iron Eyes, a retired director of natural resources for the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and one of the organizers of a camp protesters set up near the pipeline site. “All our prayers have been answered. ” Officials in November had delayed the key decision, saying more discussion was necessary about the proposed crossing, given that it would pass very near the reservation of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, whose leaders have repeatedly expressed fears that a spill could threaten the water supplies of its people. “Although we have had continuing discussion and exchanges of new information with the Standing Rock Sioux and Dakota Access, it’s clear that there’s more work to do,”   Darcy, the Army’s assistant secretary for civil works, said in a statement Sunday. “The best way to complete that work responsibly and expeditiously is to explore alternate routes for the pipeline crossing. ” The decision averts a possible showdown on Monday, the date the Army Corps, which owns land on either side of the lake, had set for cutting off access to the protesters’ camp. Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch, worried about violence, had sent mediators to the area over the weekend. The victory for the Standing Rock Sioux and its allies could be   though.   Donald Trump has vowed to support pipelines such as this one. And Kelcy Warren, the chief executive of the pipeline company Energy Transfer Partners, has been a major contributor to the Republican Party and Trump’s campaign. Trump, who owned a $500, 000 to $1 million stake in Energy Transfer Partners, has sold the shares, his spokeswoman Hope Hicks said. His most recent disclosure says he still owns a similar size stake in Phillips 66, which owns 25 percent of the Dakota Access line. Iron Eyes said that “we shall remain vigilant regardless. We have witnessed the power of being peaceful and prayerful. ” What started as a small but fierce protest in a remote spot along the Missouri River months ago has evolved into an epic standoff involving hundreds of tribes, various celebrities and activists from around the country. It has involved heated confrontations  —   police have sometimes employed water cannons, pepper spray and rubber bullets  —   and has carried on through the swelter of summer into the snowy cold of winter. Hundreds of veterans arrived in recent days.  On Sunday, news of the Army’s decision triggered a wave of celebration and relief among those who have fought to stop the    pipeline’s progress. A procession of tribe members and activists marched along the main dirt road at the Oceti Sakowin encampment set up by protesters. A crowd numbering in the thousands gathered around the camp’s sacred fire, the hub of activity here, as tribal elders sang prayer songs and beat drums. Activists acknowledged that it was only one step forward in a larger fight over Native American rights. Denise McKay, a member of the Standing Rock Sioux standing by the sacred fire Sunday afternoon, said she expects Energy Transfer Partners to push back on the decision. “It is a temporary victory,” said McKay, 54. “We’ve got to stay put and stay united. ” McKay’s daughter, Chelsea Summers, 25, chimed in, saying “everybody is still here for the long haul. ” Nearby, Bruce Gali took drags from a cigarette and watched the festivities. He made his second trip to the camp last week and said he would keep returning from his home in northeastern California until authorities left the area and the pipeline was shut down. “Until all the razor wire comes down, until the helicopters stop flying overhead, the spotlights turn off, the drill pad is dismantled, this isn’t the end,” said Gali, a    member of the Pitt River Tribe. “It’s not just about this pipeline. ” We “commend with the utmost gratitude the courage it took on the part of President Obama, the Army Corps, the Department of Justice and the Department of the Interior to take steps to correct the course of history and to do the right thing,” Standing Rock Sioux Tribe Chairman Dave Archambault II said in a statement. “With this decision we look forward to being able to return home and spend the winter with our families. ”       Rhea Suh, president of the Natural Resources Defense Council, said the outcome was a reminder of the power of individuals to “demand environmental justice. ” She said, “Today, the voices of indigenous people were heard. ” In the Dakota language, the word “oahe” signifies “a place to stand on. ” The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and its allies in the environmental and activist movements had said they were doing just that: using Lake Oahe in North Dakota as a place to take a stand by setting up camps and obstructing roads to block the $3. 8 billion Dakota Access Pipeline. The steel pipeline, developed and majority owned by Energy Transfer Partners, would connect the Bakken and Three Forks oil production areas in North Dakota to an existing crude oil terminal and pipeline terminus in Illinois. At 30 inches in diameter, it could transport an estimated 470, 000 to 570, 000 barrels of oil per day. The company says the project, which traverses four states, is 92 percent complete overall and 99 percent complete in North Dakota. Army officials said that the consideration of alternative routes would be best accomplished through an   statement with full public input and analysis, a process likely to take many months. Ordinarily, the Army Corps, which has jurisdiction over domestic petroleum pipelines, does not require a detailed   statement but it does require environmental assessments of the impact on water crossings.    North Dakota elected officials criticized the Army Corps. “It’s long past time that a decision is made on the easement going under Lake Oahe,” said Sen. Heidi Heitkamp (D). “This administration’s delay in taking action  —   after I’ve pushed the White House, Army Corps and other federal agencies for months to make a decision  —   means that today’s move doesn’t actually bring finality to the project. The pipeline still remains in limbo. ” Rep. Kevin Cramer (R) said Sunday’s decision “sends a very chilling signal to others who want to build infrastructure in this country,” arguing that Obama had stymied a perfectly legal pipeline project. “I’m encouraged we will restore law and order next month when we get a President who will not thumb his nose at the rule of law,” Cramer said in a statement. “I feel badly for the Corps of Engineers because of the diligent work it did on this project, only to have their    throw them under the bus. ” Gov. Jack Dalrymple (R) called Sunday’s decision a “serious mistake” that “does nothing to resolve the issue. ” He said it would prolong a dangerous situation by having protesters camping out on federal land during the brutally cold winter. Interior Secretary Sally Jewell, however, praised the Army’s decision. “The thoughtful approach established by the Army today ensures that there will be an   evaluation of alternative routes for the pipeline and a closer look at potential impacts,” she said Sunday. “The Army’s announcement underscores that tribal rights reserved in treaties and federal law, as well as    consultation with tribal leaders, are essential components of the analysis to be undertaken in the environmental impact statement going forward. ” Derek Hawkins contributed to this report from a camp near Cannonball, N. D."

","   OAKLAND, Calif.  —   One of the deadliest fires in recent U. S. history began amid a cluttered collective of artist studios known as the Ghost Ship and spread quickly through a   warehouse that did not have fire sprinklers, killing at least 33 people and possibly many more, officials said Sunday.  “Help me!” shouted partygoers who had gathered at the warehouse for a Friday evening of music and dancing in East Oakland’s Fruitvale district, only to find themselves trapped in an inferno. Firetrucks arrived within three minutes, officials said, but nothing could be done to stop the   flames soon enough. The sky was lit with a huge fireball, ignited by an array of artisan works, guitars, pianos, bookshelves, bowls and countless other tinderlike pieces. Bob Mule, a photographer who worked at the warehouse, told the local NBC affiliate that he saw the fire coming from the back left corner of the building. He heard a friend with a broken ankle calling for help. Mule said he raced to the friend, but “there was a lot of stuff in the way and the flames were too much. . . . I had to let him go. ” Standing outside the warehouse as flames continued to burn through the walls and the roof, with an arm bandaged from wounds suffered during his flight from the fire, Mule said he had not heard whether his friend had made it out.   Firefighters work inside the burned warehouse following the fatal fire in Oakland, Calif. (Lucy  )  As the fire raged, city officials met with roomsful of families who had undertaken anguished searches for relatives. The rescue effort quickly turned into a salvage operation. By midafternoon Sunday, officials had searched about 35 percent of the building and discovered 33 bodies, many of them charred beyond recognition, and expected to find many more. One survivor estimated that at least 50 people had been in the building. The youngest victim identified as of Sunday afternoon was 17. That person’s name was not being released.  On Sunday, the coroner’s office released the names of seven other victims: Cash Askew, 22, David Clines, 35, Travis Hough, 35, and Donna Kellogg, 32, all of Oakland; Nick   25, of Coronado, Calif.; Sara Hoda, 30, of Walnut Creek, Calif. and Brandon Chase Wittenauer, 32, of Hayward, Calif.  Firefighters moved slowly in the search, walking amid fallen beams and smoldering ruins looking for bodies. They undertook their mission at great risk, with ceilings and floors in danger of collapse. They doused flames by passing buckets down the line. The firefighters ranged in experience from a few months to 30 years, but all were affected by the intensity of the blaze and the piles of bodies they encountered along the way, officials said.  The warehouse had long been the subject of complaints. Local officials said they were alerted to possible code violations on Nov. 13, but they could not get inside the structure when they visited four days later. Local news outlets reported that a number of artists used the building as their sleeping quarters as well as studios. Asked on Sunday about the inspection, Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf (D) said: “The complaint alleged there was blight and external trash and debris, not just around the building but in the adjacent lot that is owned by the same owner. They also alleged there was illegal or unpermitted construction inside, and possible residential use. . . . The inspector was able to document the external blight but was unable to gain access to the building. So that investigation had remained open and an initial notice of violation was issued to the owner with regard to the blight. ” Local officials said it was the deadliest fire they could recall in the city, and it ranked as one of the worst structural fires in recent U. S. history. The deadliest fire in recent years occurred in 2003, when 100 people died at a West Warwick, R. I. nightclub called the Station.   A woman cries on Sunday near the site of a warehouse fire that started Friday night and killed dozens of people. (Marcio Jose  )  The fire began about 11:30 p. m. Friday, as partygoers gathered on the second floor to listen to a music group called Golden Donna. The band played before a dance floor of about 2, 500 square feet inside the roughly    warehouse. By the time firefighters arrived at the scene, the staircase had burned away, Mark Hoffmann, deputy chief of the Oakland Fire Department, said Saturday.  Firefighters used special equipment to breach a wall and then deployed the most basic means to carefully make their way inside, clearing debris with shovels and other hand tools, and dousing flames with buckets passed from one person to another. “We had firefighters with basically coveralls and buckets and shovels, taking bits of debris out into the vacant lot, to be then loaded into dump trucks and removed to an   location,” Melinda Drayton of the Oakland Fire Department said at a news conference near the scene. “This will be a long and arduous process, but we want to make sure we are respecting the victims, their families and our firefighters’ safety to work slowly and carefully through the building. ” Drayton said she was inside the structure and watched “the somber approach that [firefighters] took to this search. It was quiet, it was heartbreaking. ” She said crews found 10 of the victims in the middle of the building. Four of them were close together, and the other six were within 10 feet. Three more were found on the east side of the building, Drayton said. Sgt. Ray Kelly, spokesman for the Alameda County Sheriff’s Office, said the death toll will go up. “We will be here for days and days to come,” Kelly said. “We anticipate that the number of victims will rise and will increase. ” Questions remain about whether electrical issues, pyrotechnics or errant candles or cigarettes had started the fire. Fire officials said the building did not have sprinklers. A criminal investigation team was sent to the site to preserve the option of a possible prosecution, officials said. The building’s interior featured a tangled network of antique furniture, artwork, musical instruments, wooden lofts, tapestries and oddities, such as mannequin parts, according to a Tumblr blog that appears to show the building. Al Garcia, 62, said the warehouse across the street from his business was fully engulfed when he walked over about 12:30 a. m. Saturday. Officials say the fire broke out an hour earlier during a rave party that was attended by more than 50 people. Garcia said he saw two teenagers sitting on a sidewalk, crying. They were at the party, they told him, and were the last ones to get out. Garcia asked what happened. “It got dark, and smoke took us over,” one of the teens told him, Garcia said. They couldn’t see where they were going, they told Garcia, but they knew several people were behind them, also trying to get out. “When we turned around, nobody came out behind us,” one of the teens said, according to Garcia. The music event’s Facebook page was filled with inquiries on Saturday from people looking for their loved ones or offering their assistance to families and friends of the victims. Michael Rosen, who had been at the party Friday night, said there were no more than 75 people in attendance. “This was a very intimate gathering,” he said. “It wasn’t a wild,    party where things got out of hand. ” Carmen Brito and Nikki Kelber, who lived at the warehouse, spoke in an interview on Sunday about their emotions as they tried to process what had happened. They survived the fire but lost everything in the process except for the clothes on their backs, handouts from friends and, in Kelber’s case, her cat, Mookie, which she managed to carry out of the burning building after escaping from her   apartment. “Emotionally, for everyone who was a resident there, we are going back and forth between feeling like ‘Oh, my god, I almost died,’ to ‘Oh, my god, I lost everything,’ to ‘Oh, my god, these people died in our home,’ ” Brito said. Kelber said about 23 people lived in the building. “It was one of the most amazing, beautiful spaces you could ever see. It was so creative and so inspiring as an artist,” she said. “There was always somebody working on another project, always somebody to bounce ideas off of. Max would be tattooing or working on a piece of jewelry. . . . Anthony was sewing in the back, and Carmen was painting in the back and someone else is doing visual artistry. . . . These weren’t just roommates, and these weren’t just people who lived in a building that you didn’t talk to. These people were part of your daily lives. ”   Friends and family members of the concertgoers also cobbled together a list of missing people in a shared Google Docs spreadsheet. They included identifying features and contact numbers. Forty names were listed as of Saturday evening; seven were marked either safe or in the hospital. The list is now private. Oakland Fire Chief Teresa    said fire officials will verify those names against the ones they have compiled. “This is pretty tragic for us,”   said. “It is hitting this community pretty hard. I don’t even want to talk about how the families and friends are feeling. We have a community that’s hurting. ” The building was considered to be an “artist collective,” as city officials put it, with spaces for artists to work. “It was beautiful,” said Pete Veilleux, a friend of several of the building’s residents and the owner of a nearby   nursery called East Bay Wilds. “It was like an art gallery, but people lived there. ” As darkness fell here, the makeshift memorial on the corners of East 12th Street and 31st Avenue continued to grow.

","  BRUSSELS  —     Europe’s embattled political establishment lost another round Sunday in its effort to thwart the   movement, as Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi resigned after voters rejected his constitutional reforms. But a   presidential candidate in Austria handily defeated his   challenger. The thorough rejection of Renzi’s referendum to streamline lawmaking was a significant boost for the country’s surging populist forces just weeks after Donald Trump prevailed in the United States. Renzi’s loss also risks unleashing financial upheaval in Europe’s   economy as Italy’s weak banks struggle to contain the fallout. But the surprisingly strong presidential victory in Austria for an elder statesman formerly of the Green Party suggested there were still some limits to a wave of   anger that began in June with Britain’s vote to leave the European Union and continued with Trump’s victory last month. A populist takeover of Italy is still an uncertain prospect, since Renzi’s   Democratic Party remains in control of Parliament and national elections do not have to be called until 2018. But much will depend on the makeup of the next government and how   Euroskeptic parties capitalize on their success. “I have not managed to reach victory,” an emotional Renzi said early Monday, conceding defeat at the Palazzo Chigi, his official residence. “My government ends today. ”    Austrian presidential candidate Alexander Van der Bellen, a former leading member of the Greens Party, celebrates as election returns show him leading in the race. (Matthias  )   With 90 percent of ballots counted, 60 percent of voters rejected the reform, a drubbing that far outpaced opinion polls ahead of the referendum. Viewed narrowly, Sunday’s vote was actually in favor of the status quo, since the constitution will now remain unchanged. But the referendum to streamline the political system and diminish the role of the Senate long ago turned into a broader vote of confidence in Renzi, the youthful,   leader who portrayed himself as a lone warrior against Euroskeptic forces. Renzi, who took office in February 2014, always struggled to budge unemployment and improve the economy. The lead opposition to Renzi, the insurgent Five Star Movement, ran a spirited campaign against the prime minister’s reforms, joining forces with an unlikely   of allies, including some in Renzi’s own party. Many establishment politicians also questioned whether the reforms truly made sense as the country contends with grim prospects for growth and a wave of migration from Africa. Some said the changes were poorly written and, by removing checks on the prime minister’s power, could actually enable populists should they ever win the country’s top job. Italy, which has had 63 governments in the past 70 years, is no stranger to political chaos. What comes next will depend partially on Italian President Sergio Mattarella, who is charged with picking a new person to try to form a government, as well as with deciding whether to hold early elections. Elections are a key demand from the Five Star Movement, which is running a close second to Renzi’s party in the polls. There may also be economic consequences, with Italy’s shaky banks teetering amid the uncertainty. The euro dropped 1 percent against the dollar in early Asian trading following Renzi’s resignation, but many financial analysts cautioned against panic. In the wake of Renzi’s resignation, Italy’s mainstream political parties are likely to change voting laws to make it more difficult to rule without a wide coalition, diluting the possibility that an insurgent force could seize power in the next elections . That would be a further check against the Five Star Movement, although it would also further entrench Italy’s general political dysfunction. Renzi’s   opponents were trying to capitalize on a wave of skepticism about the ability of elites to deal with globalization and the long, painful effects of the economic crisis that started nearly a decade ago. Trump’s victory last month cheered the Five Star Movement, an insurgent   force that has support on the left and the right.   Italy’s Prime Minister Matteo Renzi announces his resignation after voters struck down a referendum on constitutional reforms. (Andreas    Images)  “Today the arrogance that’s remained in power these last years has lost,” said Luigi Di Maio, who is expected to be the party’s candidate for prime minister in the next election. “So ends the era of shortcuts and tweets. ”     Sunday’s votes in Austria and Italy  captured the extent to which Europeans are as politically polarized as Americans, split on issues including immigration and free trade. In Austria, the   Freedom Party’s Norbert Hofer conceded the election on his Facebook page less than 30 minutes after polls closed; projections showed a surprisingly strong lead for independent Alexander Van der Bellen. The    statesman and former Green Party politician was winning by 53. 3 percent to 46. 7 percent with nearly 100 percent of the votes counted. The result was an unexpectedly clear victory for Austria’s beleaguered political establishment  —   one suggesting that the aggressive tactics and   campaign deployed by the Austrian   may have hurt more than they helped. Sunday’s election, in fact, was a rerun of one in May in which Hofer lost by 31, 000 votes, a result he successfully contested. His defeat on Sunday by a far larger margin, observers said, may suggest European voters’ unease with the comparisons of their politicians to Trump. It also seemed to rob the momentum from   leaders in France and the Netherlands who have called Trump’s victory part of a new “world order” they hope to join in elections next year. Following Hofer’s concession, he and Van der Bellen exchanged a long handshake for photographers in the Vienna studios of Austrian state broadcaster ORF. Van der Bellen credited his victory to a “broad movement” backing “freedom, equality and solidarity. ” His campaign manager, Lothar Lockl, saw the margin as evidence of a push against the nationalist tide by moderates. “A movement could be evolving here, which is not only for Austria, but can also bring about a change of attitude in the whole of Europe,” he said.   The race for the president’s ceremonial role held  high stakes. The position is constitutionally ambiguous, yet Hofer, who has decried Muslim immigration and free trade, vowed to beef it up  —   setting up a clash with the   government and the European Union. Freedom Party supporters on Sunday had hoped for a “Trump bump”  —   but it bumped the wrong way. “The Trump bump could always go either way,” said Reinhard Heinisch, a political scientist at the University of Salzburg. “The fact is, Trump is not very popular in Austria. ” Hofer’s campaign in Austria seemed to echo Trump’s, with   outlets spreading damaging fake news and Hofer and his surrogates taking aim at red herrings such as his opponent’s health. There were more allegations of dirty tricks on election day. On Sunday, Austria’s domestic intelligence service launched an investigation into a mass text message that stated that only Hofer voters should show up because polling stations were overcrowded. Van der Bellen supporters, the text said, should instead vote Monday  —   although polls would be closed by then, according to the Austrian daily Der Standard. The race was perhaps more important as a bellwether of   voter trends in Europe, where nationalists are poised to stage potent 2017 campaigns in France, Germany and the Netherlands. A Hofer victory would have potentially signaled the new electability of the far right. Indeed, the Freedom Party sought to leverage Hofer’s    demeanor that seemed to take the bite out of his harshest condemnations, such as that “Islam is not part of Austria. ” Still, while portraying himself as the face of a reformed far right, he persisted in courting a more extreme base. For instance, he wore a cornflower lapel pin  —   a symbol of German nationalism also used by the Nazis. Hofer on Sunday called for national unity following his defeat. Yet within his party, the attacks were already flying. The Freedom Party’s powerful chairman,   Strache, accused Hofer’s opponents of running a “massive fear campaign,” saying Green Party supporters of Van der Bellen had painted Hofer as “a Nazi. ”            Faiola reported from Berlin.

","       Donald Trump fired another warning shot Sunday at U. S. companies considering moving their operations out of the country, threatening “retributions or consequences” such as a hefty border tax if they do. The pronouncements came in a string of early morning tweets. Trump said he intends to incentivize businesses to stay in America by lowering corporate taxes and slashing regulations, two key components of his economic agenda. But he also warned that companies with offshore factories would face a 35 percent tariff on goods sold back to the United States.   The U. S. is going to substantialy reduce taxes and regulations on businesses, but any business that leaves our country for another country,  —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 4, 2016     fires its employees, builds a new factory or plant in the other country, and then thinks it will sell its product back into the U. S. . .....  —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 4, 2016     without retribution or consequence, is WRONG! There will be a tax on our soon to be strong border of 35% for these companies . .....  —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 4, 2016    Trump’s comments follow his direct intervention in an Indiana factory owned by Carrier, which makes heating and   units, where production was scheduled to shift to Mexico. Trump announced last week that he had negotiated a deal to keep the plant in the state. Indiana promised to provide Carrier about $7 million in incentives, while the company would invest $16 million in the factory over the next two years.      Speaking at the Carrier plant in Indianapolis, Dec. 1,   Donald Trump said he decided to call the company so it would not ship jobs abroad after watching a television news report about the factory. (The Washington Post)   About 800 jobs that had been slated to move to Mexico will remain at the plant, according to a person familiar with the negotiations. About 300 to 600 Carrier positions  —   including 700 at one of the company’s other factories in the state  —   will still be cut.  Trump’s messages Sunday morning drew skepticism from some Republicans such as Sen. Ben Sasse (Neb.) who have generally favored a   approach to the economy.     Trump means well. But won’t his 35% tariff idea raise prices on American families? How would it not be a new 35% tax on families?  —   Ben Sasse (@BenSasse) December 4, 2016   Still, Trump advisers said he would be deeply involved in    corporate decisions like perhaps no other Republican before.   . @mike_pence: Donald Trump will make decision to intervene with companies talking of moving jobs overseas ”on a    basis.” #thisweek pic. twitter.   —   This Week (@ThisWeekABC) December 4, 2016   On the stump, Trump espoused an aggressively protectionist stance toward international trade, and his skepticism of the benefits of globalization resonated with many   voters who bore the brunt of its downside. But since his election, his advisers have softened some of his most heated rhetoric. Trump’s picks for treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, and commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross, said that they would pursue bilateral trade agreements with other countries but remained wary of sweeping regional deals. Ross also said that blanket   tariffs on goods from Mexico and China  —   which many economists warned could spark a damaging trade war  —   would only be used as a last resort. But Trump’s comments Sunday indicate that he is not backing away from one key pledge: to punish companies that offshore jobs. “We’re living through the greatest jobs theft in the history of the world,” Trump said last week. Trump celebrated the Carrier deal with a tour of the factory last week, followed by a rally in Cincinnati to kick off his “thank you” tour. On Capitol Hill, some conservatives criticized the deal as a government distortion of the free market, while liberal lawmakers called the tax breaks a corporate subsidy. But business groups generally welcomed the move. “Now, hundreds of Indiana workers will now keep good jobs, preserving their place in the middle class,” Scott Paul, president of the Alliance for American Manufacturing, said in a statement Friday. “While inducements and   interventions aren’t the most efficient ways to keep jobs here, they’re sometimes absolutely necessary. ”"
142053,217411,Trump expands search for secretary of state beyond Romney and three other finalists,Washington Post,John Wagner,2016-12-04,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161205004132/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/12/04/trump-expanding-search-for-secretary-of-state-beyond-romney-and-three-other-finalists/
","       Donald Trump has expanded his search for a secretary of state beyond the four finalists his aides previously identified, including former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney, a senior adviser said Sunday. Kellyanne Conway, who managed Trump’s election campaign, told reporters that he plans to interview additional candidates this week and does not want to rush the decision. “It is true that he’s broadened the search, and the secretary of state is an incredibly important position for any president to fill,” she said. “He’s very fortunate to have interest among serious men and women. ”  Among the other names that have surfaced for the position is Jon Huntsman, a former Republican Utah governor who also has served as ambassador to China. Huntsman sought the Republican presidential nomination in 2012, backing Romney after dropping out. Speaking to reporters in Trump Tower, Conway declined to confirm consideration of Huntsman or to offer names of other possible contenders. “Who knows how many finalists there will be,” she said. “It’s a big decision, and nobody should rush through it. ” Besides Romney, the secretary of state finalists whom Trump aides had previously identified were former New York mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, a Trump confidant during the campaign; retired decorated military officer David H. Petraeus; and Sen. Bob Corker ( .) chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Trump’s consideration of Romney has been most visible, including a dinner last week in New York that Romney afterward described as “a wonderful evening. ”  The choice of Romney, the 2012 Republican nominee, would send a reassuring signal to the moderate wing of the party and to the foreign policy establishment. But Trump loyalists have bristled at the prospect of rewarding someone who was among Trump’s harshest Republican critics during the campaign. In arguing against Trump’s fitness for office, Romney called him a “phony,” a “fake” and a “con man. ” Evidence of the unease with Romney was evident at Trump’s first stop on a “thank you” tour last week in Cincinnati, where chants of “No Romney” broke out among the boisterous crowd. Giuliani has openly campaigned for the secretary of state post but faces questions about his international business ties that could make Senate confirmation challenging. Petraeus, a former CIA director, also has interviewed with Trump, but he has a significant liability: Last year, he pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge of mishandling classified information, admitting that he gave sensitive materials to former lover and biographer Paula Broadwell. During an appearance Sunday on ABC News’s “This Week,” Petraeus acknowledged his mistake and said that “they’ll have to factor that in and also obviously 38½ years of otherwise fairly, in some cases, unique service to our country in uniform and then at the CIA and then some four years or so in the business community. ” Corker would probably be easily confirmed by his Senate colleagues but has said he does not expect to get the job. During an interview on CBS’s “Face the Nation,” Reince Priebus, Trump’s incoming chief of staff, acknowledged that the search “is taking just a little bit longer, and I think it’s just fine. ” “Everything doesn’t have to happen all at once,” Priebus said. “He’s taking his time, making a smart decision, and we will see where that goes. ” Priebus sought to play down the significance of Romney’s past criticism of Trump. “I think Governor Romney is very talented,” he said. “And I think what really we should look at is that we have got a president here in Donald Trump that wants to look at the best and brightest of America, regardless of background, regardless of past disputes that we may have had with each other, that that is the past. That’s the rearview mirror. ” Conway, who has publicly voiced concerns about Romney, however, questioned during another television appearance on Sunday whether it was “appropriate for Governor Romney to stick his neck out so far in attacking Donald Trump” during the campaign. “And never walking it back, never encouraging people to support the nominee once Mr. Trump had won the nomination squarely and fairly?” Conway said on “Fox News Sunday. ” “So, I’ve spoken my piece on that,” she said. “And, certainly, the   knows and I said publicly and will say here again: Whatever he chooses and whomever he chooses has my full support and backing. ”"

","     Sometime in the next few weeks, Donald Trump will be briefed on the procedures for how to activate the U. S. nuclear arsenal, if he hasn’t already learned about them. All year, the prospect of giving the real estate and reality TV mogul the power to launch attacks that would kill millions of people was one of the main reasons his opponents argued against electing him. “A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons,” Hillary Clinton said in her speech accepting the Democratic presidential nomination. She cut an ad along the same lines. Republicans who didn’t support Trump  —   and even some who did, such as Sen. Marco Rubio (Fla.)  —   also said they didn’t think he could be trusted with the launch codes. Now they’re his. When Trump takes office in January, he will have sole authority over more than 7, 000 warheads. There is no failsafe. The whole point of U. S. nuclear weapons control is to make sure that the president  —   and only the president  —   can use them if and whenever he decides to do so. The one sure way to keep President Trump from launching a nuclear attack, under the system we’ve had in place since the early Cold War, would have been to elect someone else. * * * When the legal framework for nuclear weapons was developed, the fear wasn’t about irrational presidents but   generals. The Atomic Energy Act of 1946, which was passed with President Harry Truman’s signature after nine months of acrimonious congressional hearings, firmly put the power of the atomic bomb in the hands of the president and the civilian components of the executive branch. It was a momentous and controversial law, crafted in the months following the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, with an eye toward future standoffs with the Soviet Union. The members of Congress who wrote the law, largely with the backing of the scientists who worked on the Manhattan Project, framed it explicitly as a question of who controls the power to use nuclear weapons: Is dropping an atomic bomb a military act or a political one? If it is inherently political, above and beyond a regular military tactic, then that power could not be entrusted to the military. Ultimately, the president was supposed to be the check against the Pentagon pushing to use nukes more often. The scientists’ fears were based in their experiences in World War II. Their work under the Army Corps of Engineers and the Army Air Forces left them with a sour taste: Generals, they concluded, cared little about ethics, democracy or international politics. Even during the war, some civilians involved with   work feared that the military had become too eager to leave German and Japanese cities in cinders. The secretary of war, Henry Stimson, learned about the ruinous firebombing of Tokyo from the press. He warned Truman that letting the military run the show might cause the United States to “get the reputation of outdoing Hitler in atrocities. ” This division between military and civilian control over nuclear weapons has been weaker or stronger at various points. In the late 1940s, U. S. nuclear weapons could have their nuclear components  —   the plutonium or uranium “pits” needed to start their reactions  —   removed and inserted as needed. The nuclear parts of the atomic bombs were in the custody of the civilian Atomic Energy Commission (the precursor to the   Energy Department) while the military controlled the nonnuclear parts. The president had the power to transfer these pits to the military and order their use. During the Eisenhower administration, more compact and complex weapons were developed whose nuclear and nonnuclear parts could not be separated. Fearing a Soviet sneak attack, President Dwight D. Eisenhower put the military in charge of most of the U. S. nuclear stockpile to streamline a possible response. Eisenhower also “ ” authority to the military to use tactical nuclear weapons (aimed at tanks, not cities) without getting specific presidential approval in certain situations, such as if Soviet tank columns rolled into Germany’s Fulda Gap.  Fears of   commanders setting off nuclear conflagrations during the tensions of the early 1960s persuaded President John F. Kennedy to dial some of this back. Miscommunications during the Cuban missile crisis almost led to the use of nuclear weapons by both U. S. and Soviet troops, and U. S. weapons stationed abroad, such as the Jupiter missiles in Turkey, could be used by any army that seized control of them. There were also lingering concerns about “Strangelove”  rogue generals. The head of the Strategic Air Command, Gen. Thomas Power, was an enthusiastic proponent of preemptive nuclear war. Similar concerns within the upper reaches of the Kennedy administration led to a push for technologies to “lock” the nuclear weapons and prevent their use without some kind of codes or authorization. Some early versions were as primitive as combination locks, but later versions were complex   systems that could physically disable a weapon if it were tampered with or if the wrong code was entered too many times. Eventually, the brass adopted the idea that, when it came to nuclear matters, they were at the beck and call of the president. It was not generals’ responsibility to make the order; it was their responsibility to carry it out.      Sen. Kelly Ayotte became the second U. S. senator this month to hesitate when asked whether she’d trust Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump with the U. S. nuclear arsenal. (Peter   Washington Post)   That the president would be the only person competent to use nuclear weapons was never challenged. Even asking the question would throw the entire system into disarray, as Maj. Harold Hering learned in 1973. Hering was a   Air Force veteran who was decorated for his flying in Vietnam before being sent for training as a nuclear missile squadron commander. He had been taught that officers had an obligation to disobey illegal orders. So when he was told how to launch a nuclear attack, he asked what seemed like a simple question: How could he be sure that an order to launch his missiles was lawful? How could he be sure, for example, that the president wasn’t insane? Instead of an answer, he got the boot: an aborted promotion and an administrative discharge for “failure to demonstrate acceptable qualities of leadership” and for indicating “a defective mental attitude towards his duties. ” The Air Force’s problem, in short, is that once a serviceman starts down the rabbit hole of doubt, he becomes an unreliable    —   and suddenly he is one of the few people who can decide whether nuclear weapons are used. * * * The procedure for ordering a nuclear attack involves more than one person: The president cannot literally press a button on his desk and start World War III. There is no “nuclear button” at all. Instead, the U. S. nuclear    system is bureaucratically and technically complex, stretching out to encompass   missile silos,   ballistic and cruise missiles, and weapons capable of being dropped from bombers. The chain of command requires that the president order the secretary of defense to carry out a launch; the secretary serves as the conduit for implementation by the military. There are succession policies in place so that the procedure can be continued in the event of the death or incapacitation of either the president or the secretary of defense  —   or their designated successors. Most details of how a nuclear war would be started are classified, because an enemy who knew enough about the system could come up with ways to complicate or defeat it. What is known is that an aide is always following the president, carrying at least one large satchel (often two) known as the “nuclear football,” reportedly containing information about nuclear attack possibilities and how the president could verify his identity, authenticate orders and communicate with the military about implementing them.  Could the secretary of defense refuse to carry out a presidential order for a nuclear attack? The legal and constitutional aspects are not clear. The official doctrine that has been released says nothing about this question, and the cryptic public responses to official inquiries, even from Congress, indicate that it is not something that can be openly talked about. “Only the president can authorize the use of nuclear weapons” is essentially the only reply officials ever give to any questions about nuclear controls. Could the president simply fire the defense secretary and move on to the deputy secretary, the secretary of the Army and so on through the chain of command? Maybe. Such an action would at least slow things down, even if the refusal to carry out the order was illegal. Commanders further down the pipeline are trained to act quickly on any orders that do come in. The launch officers are trained to launch weapons, not to debate the legality or advisability of the action. Hence the problem with Hering’s question in 1973: While nuclear launch officers are not meant to be strictly mechanical (and indeed, the United States has always resisted fully automating the process) if they stopped to question whether their authenticated orders were legitimate, they would put the credibility of U. S. nuclear deterrence at risk. Congress held hearings on these issues in the   but nothing came of them. The debate faded away except among a small circle of nuclear wonks. In the early 1980s, Jeremy Stone, then the president of the Federation of American Scientists, proposed that Congress ought to pass a law restricting presidential use of nuclear weapons. The idea was fairly simple: So long as no nuclear weapons had been used by another power in a conflict, the president should not be able to order a first strike with nuclear weapons without getting approval from a fairly large committee of   members of Congress. It would not eliminate the possibility of an American first strike but would spread the responsibility more democratically. The idea was   by legal scholars, who noted that Congress has often been far more belligerent than presidents and that the logistics could be complicated. The people who set up the current    system did believe there was a check in place: elections. Don’t want an insane president to have nuclear weapons? Don’t put one in office. But this isn’t necessarily much of a check  —   even rational presidents have bad days; even   people succumb to mental illness or substance abuse. It might be worth resurrecting this debate  if we take seriously the idea that presidents  —   any of them, much less Trump  —   should not have the legal authority to conduct arbitrary and unilateral nuclear war. Perhaps now, decades after the end of the Cold War, we are past the moment when we need to entrust that power in a single person. One can imagine a law that would allow the president to use nuclear weapons in the face of imminent danger, the sort of situation in which a matter of minutes or even seconds could make a difference, but would enact formal requirements for outside consensus when more options were on the table. It would not require a full renunciation of the possibility of a   nuclear attack (something the United States has never been willing to make) but might add some reassurances that such decisions would not be made unilaterally. Congress ceded a considerable amount of power to the presidency in 1946. Seventy years later, maybe it is time lawmakers took some of it back."

That’s dangerous.,Washington Post,Phillip Carter,2016-11-30,2016.0,11.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161205004132/https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/trump-is-surrounding-himself-with-generals-thats-dangerous/2016/11/30/e6a0a972-b190-11e6-840f-e3ebab6bcdd3_story.html
","    Phillip Carter is a former Army officer and Pentagon official who leads the military, veterans and society program at the Center for a New American Security. Loren DeJonge Schulman is a former Pentagon and National Security Council official who is deputy director of studies at the Center for a New American Security.   More than any other   in recent memory, Donald Trump has sought out military brass to populate his inner circle. Trump announced Thursday that he wants retired Marine Gen. James Mattis as his defense secretary  —   a post traditionally designated for a civilian. Trump is also considering retired Army Gen. David Petraeus for secretary of state, retired Marine Gen. John Kelly for secretary of state or homeland security, and Adm. Michael S. Rogers as the director of national intelligence. His national security   Michael Flynn, retired from the Army as a lieutenant general after decades as a military intelligence officer. And CIA   Mike Pompeo graduated from West Point and served during the Cold War as an Army officer.  There is a great American tradition of veterans holding high political office, from Presidents George Washington and Dwight Eisenhower to senior officials such as Secretary of State Colin Powell in the George W. Bush administration and national security adviser James Jones in the Obama administration. A typical administration, though, starts out with few recent generals in key positions. Filling as many slots with retired brass as Trump is poised to do is highly unusual.  No doubt these men bring tremendous experience. But we should be wary about an overreliance on military figures. Great generals don’t always make great Cabinet officials. And if appointed in significant numbers, they could undermine another strong American tradition: civilian control of an apolitical military. Trump was often dismissive of military leaders during his campaign. He boasted that he knew more than the generals did about fighting the Islamic State. He repeatedly criticized them for broadcasting their attack strategies before the fact. He said they had been “reduced to rubble” under President Obama and even threatened to remove some of them once he took office.     Retired Army Gen. David H. Petraeus has emerged as a potential secretary of state pick for the upcoming administration of   Donald Trump. (Bastien Inzaurralde, Osman   Washington Post)   Still, it’s understandable why he would embrace them now. The military enjoys the highest approval rating of any institution in American society. And hiring former generals is a sure way to gain legitimacy  —   whether the president is a   senator from Illinois seeking cover on his Iraq withdrawal, or a reality television star and casino mogul who lost the popular vote and has a reputation as a foreign policy neophyte. Of course, Trump’s picks have implications beyond political theater. And perceived legitimacy shouldn’t be confused with the likelihood of success in high civilian offices. Like any prospective employees, veterans should be judged on their merits beyond rank or military service. The historical record shows that veterans with similar pedigrees can perform very differently when appointed to high offices. Consider the cases of retired Air Force Lt. Gen. Brent Scowcroft, who was national security adviser to Presidents Gerald Ford and George H. W. Bush, and Army Gen. Alexander Haig, who served under President Ronald Reagan as secretary of state. Each came to his role with impeccable military credentials and considerable experience in Washington. Scowcroft performed brilliantly, running an effective National Security Council that stewarded U. S. foreign policy as the Cold War ended, the Soviet Union broke apart and the United States fought the Persian Gulf War. Haig performed poorly, causing (or nearly causing) several   crises with his   assertion that he was in charge following the assassination attempt on Reagan and with his blustery diplomacy toward the Soviet Union. Haig resigned a year and a half into the administration.  It’s impossible to know whether Trump’s veterans would be more like Scowcroft or more like Haig. Mattis, the   displayed his strategic and operational genius as a Marine general, but wrangling the Defense Department bureaucracy is a different matter. As our colleague Erin Simpson wrote, he viscerally disdains the minutiae and machinery of the Pentagon. “Budgets, white papers, and service rivalries, not to mention the interagency meetings and White House meddling  —   these tasks are not what you go to Jim Mattis for,” she argued. “Not only does the role of secretary of defense not play to Mattis’ strengths, but success in that role would compromise much that we admire most in him: his bluntness, clarity, and   focus on warfighting. The secretary’s job is by necessity much more political than all that. You can’t run the Pentagon like the First Marine Division. ”  Flynn is an iconoclast whose record of   leadership at the Joint Special Operations Command and the Defense Intelligence Agency does not augur well for how he might manage the National Security Council process or get rival agencies to work together. Even Flynn’s greatest success  —   the building of the Joint Special Operations intelligence machine under Gen. Stanley McChrystal  —   probably won’t translate well in his new role. Flynn succeeded at the JSOC because of the unique battlefield conditions of his job, his narrow mandate and the incredible leadership capabilities of his boss, whose force of personality helped knit together the “team of teams,” as McChrystal called it, that JSOC became. Petraeus epitomizes the modern U. S. military leader, but his leadership style did not graft well onto the CIA and would probably be an even worse fit at the State Department or another agency.      Retired U. S. Marine Corps General James Mattis is emerging as a potential favorite for   Donald Trump’s secretary of defense nominee. (Jenny   Washington Post)   Relying on the brass, however individually talented, to run so much of the government could also jeopardize   relations.  Our founders embedded civilian control of the military in our Constitution for good reasons: They wanted to avoid a military dictatorship and limit the potential for military coups. “War is in fact the true nurse of executive aggrandizement,” James Madison wrote in 1793. And so they formalized checks and balances by making the president the commander in chief, while vesting Congress with the power to declare, regulate and fund war.  This principle was later strengthened in the National Security Act of 1947, which mandated that the secretary of defense come from civilian life and prohibited appointment within 10 (later seven) years of relief from active duty. An exception was made for the appointment of Army general and former secretary of state George Marshall in 1950, but lawmakers emphasized then that “no additional appointments of military men to that office shall be approved. ”  Mattis  —   who retired from active duty only three years ago  —   will need Congress to pass new legislation if he is to serve. Teaming him with several other retired officers in the Cabinet and on the National Security Council would not require congressional approval, but it would be similarly  . “Civilian control is so fundamental to the character and the way we think about the United States,” former Pentagon strategist Jim Thomas told The Washington Post’s Greg Jaffe. “It’s something that should be preserved at all costs. ”  Traditional   relations focus on the ways the president and Cabinet engage with the military and make decisions, a vertical dimension that has always been complex. Historically, it was viewed as a   command relationship, in which presidents would set objectives for generals, and the generals would figure out how to get the job done. Contemporary scholars such as Eliot Cohen (who served in the George W. Bush administration) and Janine Davidson (who is currently undersecretary of the Navy) describe the relationship now as an “unequal dialogue” of civilian guidance and military advice among actors, agencies and interests that results in decisions by the president. Cohen says it is a “conflictual collaborative relationship, in which the civilian usually (at least in democracies) has the upper hand. It is a conflict often exacerbated by the differences in experience and outlook. . . . These differences are not ideological but temperamental, even cultural. ” Davidson builds on Cohen’s point, adding that “as long as these differences do not lead to the bureaucratic equivalent of lines drawn in the sand, they can enrich the process by which strategies are debated and decided. By expecting and accommodating a degree of friction, the national security system also avoids the groupthink that arises when friction is absent. ”  How Trump’s generals, should they serve, would behave in this ecosystem  —   and how they would relate to subordinate generals, to whom they have been friends, rivals or commanders  —   remains an open question. It’s unlikely that hiring generals for the Cabinet would instantly lead to good   relations. It may, in fact, cause deterioration. The deliberate tension of the   dynamic may be magnified by Trump’s criticisms of the military leadership, or by existing (and not uniformly positive) relationships between Trump’s slate of veteran leaders and today’s general officers. On the other hand, the potential for veterans to align with their   counterparts may skew some of the healthy tension built into the relationship. Alongside the vertical dimension of   relations, there is also a horizontal dimension: how the military relates to other instruments of U. S. power, such as intelligence, diplomacy and finance. Here, the great risk of Trump picking so many generals echoes the old proverb: When you have a hammer, all problems begin to look like nails. This risk is particularly acute now, after 15 years of war, when the military has achieved such policy and budget primacy, and military tools are often looked to as options of first, rather than last, resort. It is not obvious that retired military officers are the right people to better use nonmilitary tools of statecraft.  And there is a societal dimension of   relations that may suffer by the appointment of retired military leaders to high office. The share of veterans in society is in decline, a result of a smaller military, the lack of conscription and a growing population. Concerns abound about the   divide, and how the military should relate to society when a shrinking percentage of Americans serve in uniform or have a personal connection to those who do. Senior military leaders have spent their entire adult lives inside the bubble of the force  —   living in America’s most exclusive gated communities, in an insular society that has its own legal code, language and customs. Our military is both a part of America and apart from America. Generals and admirals emerging from this environment may be stellar leaders and military professionals, but they make unlikely ambassadors to bridge the   divide. This is true even for generals such as Mattis and Petraeus, great students of   relations who have each written on the subject.  Mattis, in his new book with Kori Schake, “Warriors and Citizens,” highlights the difference between civilian and veteran approaches to policymaking, writing that “veterans are believed to be more hesitant to use military force than civilians. ” However, Mattis and Schake add that “military leaders often try to leach the politics out of political decision making in order to better analyze problems and develop strategy; this can lead to ‘perfect’ solutions impractical for consideration by elected officials whose portfolios are broader than the military mandate alone. ” This is the essence of the challenge facing senior military leaders promoted to the political level: how to appropriately consider nonmilitary factors, including electoral politics and the will of the people, when making decisions for the country. Finally, Trump’s embrace of the generals may undermine the apolitical, professional ethos at the heart of our   force. Former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Martin Dempsey implored his fellow generals and admirals to “not become part of the public political landscape” during the 2016 election. Although he was speaking of political endorsements, the concerns Dempsey raised offer a useful guidepost for why administrations should be thoughtful in offering political appointments to retired military officers. The greatest risk posed by Trump’s rush to court the brass is the extent to which our military leadership may become, in reality or perception, a politicized institution. This might, as Dempsey surmised, lead “future administrations . . . to determine which senior [military] leaders would be more likely to agree with them before putting them in senior leadership positions. ” In the short term, Trump may be satisfied with a politicized military that seems more responsive to him. In the long run, however, both the Trump administration and our national security will suffer if his appointments undermine the institutional integrity of the military and corrupt its leadership in service of political ends.

","         The presidential race dominated my reading this year  —   like it seemed to dominate everything. So as I sift through my 2016 stacks, I see plenty of works on politics, candidate memoirs and books hitting on   campaign debates. But fortunately, that was not all. There were also works of history, education, psychology and even comedy that made my reading list. Whether they enlightened or annoyed, impressed or exasperated, these are the books that I suspect I will remember most from the past year: The most overrated book I read this year: “Strangers in Their Own Land: Anger and Mourning on the American Right” (The New Press) by Arlie Russell Hochschild A finalist for the 2016 National Book Award, this book was the subject of admiring reviews and interviews  —   but I couldn’t stand it. The author, a Berkeley sociologist, travels to southwestern Louisiana seeking to understand “how life feels to people on the right,” but she can’t let go of her   preconceptions. Hochschild assumes that rural conservatives all read Ayn Rand, for instance, and is surprised that many of them are “warm, open people. ” If you’re interested in exploring class resentments in the Trump era, I’d suggest picking up J. D. Vance’s “Hillbilly Elegy,” Nancy Isenberg’s cultural history “White Trash,” or Carol Anderson’s “White Rage” instead. [Read the review]    (Simon & Schuster)  Most enjoyable: “Seinfeldia: How a Show About Nothing Changed Everything” (Simon & Schuster) by Jennifer Keishin Armstrong I’m a   Gen Xer, so “Seinfeld” will forever be my favorite sitcom  —   not that there’s anything wrong with that. But it’s not just nostalgia that makes me enjoy Armstrong’s detailed history of the show and her assessment of its cultural impact. In addition to reliving the biggest laughs along the way, Armstrong shares the experiences of the   “Seinfeld” writers, who desperately mined their personal lives for man hands, fake holidays or any script ideas that would seem believable to   Jerry Seinfeld and Larry David. An eminently   book. [Read the review] Most ambitious: “Stamped From the Beginning: The Definitive History of Racist Ideas in America” (Nation Books) by Ibram X. Kendi Sure, “ambitious” is usually code for “long,” and at nearly 600 pages, this book qualifies. But it is also an engrossing and relentless study of how even   individuals can succumb to prejudice and enable racist structures. Spanning the 15th century through today, Kendi shows how racist thinking always crops up after the fact to justify discriminatory actions and how “assimilationists”  —   those who seek to fight disparities but find blame in both the oppressed and the oppressors  —   are complicit. From Frederick Douglass to Barack Obama, no one is unscathed in this deserving winner of the 2016 National Book Award. [Read the review] Most surprising: “Keep the Damned Women Out: The Struggle for Coeducation” (Princeton University Press) by Nancy Weiss Malkiel There are things you take for granted, until you learn how recently they came about or how tortuous their path. That’s how I felt while reading Malkiel’s history of how several elite U. S. universities  —   in particular, Yale, Princeton, Harvard and Dartmouth  —   finally offered full undergraduate education for women starting in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Still, “coeducation did not mean revolution,” she writes. Women have adapted to these former male bastions more than they have transformed them. [Read the review]    (Simon & Schuster)  Laziest: “Stronger Together: A Blueprint for America’s Future” (Simon & Schuster Paperbacks) by Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine The official   campaign book, “Stronger Together” is a   of   speeches and policy statements. The book feels rushed, dutiful and sloppy  —   chunks of text repeat themselves on several occasions  —   and its checklist quality makes it read like an endless State of the Union address. Meant to convey Day One readiness, the book instead offers a mix of incompetence and hubris. I’ll never understand why the campaign bothered to put it together. Maybe staffers had nothing better to do two months before Election Day? [Read the review] The best book by one of our presidential candidates: “It Takes a Village” (Simon & Schuster) by Hillary Clinton Although it was panned when it came out nearly 21 years ago, “It Takes a Village” has aged well and offers more insight into Clinton than either of her two subsequent memoirs, “Living History” and “Hard Choices. ” Written after the defeat of her   initiative, “It Takes a Village” lays out Clinton’s political vision  —   a surprising blend of moderation, social conservatism and activist ambition that foreshadowed her struggles to fend off the Bernie Sanders insurgency on her left in this latest presidential bid. [Read the review]    (University of Pennsylvania)  Most enlightening: “What Is Populism?” (University of Pennsylvania Press) by   Müller This slim, incisive book helped me grasp the rise of Donald Trump in American politics better than anything else. By building a framework for understanding populist movements  —   they are not just   but also   and politically exclusionary  —   Müller elucidates the strategy and appeal of the Trump phenomenon, and the divisions it has revealed and created. The “core claim” of populism, he writes, is that “only some of the people are really the people. ” And by outlining the typical governing strategies of populist regimes, it offers a possible preview of a Trump administration in action. [Read the review] Saddest: “A Mother’s Reckoning: Living in the Aftermath of Tragedy” (Crown Publishers) by Sue Klebold Seventeen years after the massacre at Columbine High School, the mother of one of the killers tells her story, and it makes for brutal, painful and necessary reading. Sue Klebold scours her younger son’s childhood for warning signs, both questions and defends her own parenting, and regrets not listening more closely to what Dylan tried to tell her. “I wish I had acknowledged his feelings instead of trying to talk him out of them,” she writes. Reading this book as a critic is hard; reading it as a parent is devastating. [Read the review] Most hopeful: “The Fractured Republic: Renewing America’s Social Contract in the Age of Individualism” (Basic Books) by Yuval Levin A leading thinker in the “reform conservative” movement, Levin has authored a new vision for the American right, one less concerned with tearing down Washington or promoting   than with creating space for the “mediating institutions” of family and community to thrive. It is a vision that seems to have little chance in Trump’s GOP, yet it is precisely for this reason that I find it a hopeful work. In an era of painful divisions, Levin wants us to bowl together again. [Read the review]    (Metropolitan Books)  Most prescient: “Listen, Liberal: Or, What Ever Happened to the Party of the People?” (Metropolitan Books) by Thomas Frank For those still pondering how Hillary Clinton lost, Frank’s book, published eight months before the election, is an excellent start. In recent decades, he argues, the Democratic Party has abandoned the working class and instead embraced the professional class of doctors, lawyers, engineers, entrepreneurs, financiers, artists and other   creatives. He blames Bill and Hillary Clinton, who fell in love with Wall Street, and President Obama, who fell in love with Silicon Valley  —   all at the expense of traditional liberal causes. “They didn’t believe in those things,” Frank writes, a simple and damning assessment. [Read the review] Most useful: “The Confidence Game: Why We Fall for It . . . Every Time” (Viking) by Maria Konnikova A contributing writer for the New Yorker, Konnikova breaks down the psychology of schemes and scams across the centuries in “The Confidence Game,” a disturbing manual on how to avoid getting conned. Each chapter explains one step in the fraud: the   the play, the rope, the tale, the convincer, the breakdown, the touch and, finally, the  . “Despite our deep certainty in our own immunity,” Konnikova writes, “we all fall for it. ” Whether you’re dealing with a card cheat, a fake nonprofit or a crooked vendor, it’s the kind of book that makes you wonder about everyone  —   and trust no one. [Read the review]    (New York Review Books)  Most ominous: “The Shipwrecked Mind: On Political Reaction” (New York Review Books) by Mark Lilla The book is a sequel of sorts to “The Reckless Mind,” Lilla’s 2001 study of leading intellectuals who grew to fetishize authoritarian politics. In this new volume, Lilla, a professor of humanities at Columbia University, examines the gathering forces of reaction among the American right, longing for the uniformity of the early postwar years; European nationalists, blaming Enlightenment values for the continent’s ills; and political Islamists, animated by visions of a caliphate restored. Their reactionary nostalgia is more powerful than liberal hope. “Hopes can be disappointed,” Lilla writes. “Nostalgia is irrefutable. ” [Read the review] Most irritating: “Why We Write About Ourselves: Twenty Memoirists on Why They Expose Themselves (and Others) in the Name of Literature” (Plume) by Meredith Maran (editor) I love memoirs, but after reading this book, I can’t say I’m terribly fond of memoir writers. A collection of reflections from some 20 practitioners of the genre, this book wallows in the   involved in telling all. Is memoir therapeutic? Should you care about hurting those closest to you? And is it okay to mix in some fictional elements to fill in the holes and enhance the drama? There are helpful insights here for the aspiring oversharer, but for this reader, there is something extra   about baring your soul about how good you are at baring your soul. [Read the review] Smartest: “We Gon’ Be Alright: Notes on Race and Resegregation” (Picador) by Jeff Chang I almost categorized this work as the smartest book I read “on race” this year  —   but then I realized it was the smartest, period. Stanford University’s Chang skillfully combines reporting, reflection and insight to explain the commercialization of diversity, the contradictions of the Asian American experience and, above all, the reversing of desegregation efforts in education and housing. “From Wallace and Nixon to Palin and Trump,” Chang writes, “the energies of anxious whites have been diverted from class uprising toward racial division. ” [Read the review]    (Brookings Institution Press)  The book I’d most want   Trump to read: “Why Presidents Fail: And How They Can Succeed Again” (Brookings Institution Press) by Elaine C. Kamarck Trump is not prone to reading much, but if he has time to pick up a book during this presidential transition, he could do worse than to delve into Kamarck’s warnings of a “crisis of competence” in American government. Modern presidents are obsessed with the communications and theatrical aspects of the job, she writes, and they tend to neglect the crucial task of getting to know the massive federal bureaucracy they command  —   both its limits and its possibilities. Trump seems especially susceptible to this problem. As a result, presidents’ ability to manage crises and implement policy suffers greatly. [Read the review] And the best book I read this year: “Evicted: Poverty and Profit in the American City” (Crown) by Matthew Desmond In this astonishing feat of ethnography, Desmond immerses himself in the lives of Milwaukee families caught in the cycle of chronic eviction. In spare and penetrating prose, this Harvard sociologist chronicles the economic and psychological toll of living in substandard housing, and the eviscerating impact of constantly moving between homes and shelters. With “Evicted,” Desmond has made it impossible to consider poverty without grappling with the role of housing. [Read the review] This pick was not close.

142057,217415,Robots won’t kill the workforce. They’ll save the global economy.,Washington Post,Ruchir Sharma,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161205004132/https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2016/12/02/robots-wont-kill-the-workforce-theyll-save-the-global-economy/
","     The United Nations forecasts that the global population will rise from 7. 3 billion to nearly 10 billion by 2050, a big number that often prompts warnings about overpopulation. Some have come from   who fear that population growth will outstrip the food supply, leaving a hungry planet. Others appear in the tirades of   populists, invoking the specter of a rising tide of humanity as cause to slam borders shut. Still others inspire a chorus of   who fear that the “rise of the robots” is rapidly making human workers obsolete, a threat all the more alarming if the human population is exploding. Before long, though, we’re more likely to treasure robots than to revile them. They may be the one thing that can protect the global economy from the dangers that lie ahead. An increase of 2. 5 billion people may sound catastrophic. But what matters for economic growth is not the number of people but the rate of population growth. Since its peak in the 1960s, that rate has slumped by almost half to just 1 percent, and the U. N. forecast assumes that this slowdown will continue. Women are having fewer children, so fewer people are entering the working ages between 15 and 64, and   growth is poised to decline from Chile to China. At the same time, owing to rapid advances in health care and medicine, people are living longer  and most of the coming global population increase will be among the retirement crowd. These trends are toxic for economic growth, and boosting the number of robots may be the easiest answer for many countries. One simple way to estimate how fast an economy can grow is by adding   population growth and productivity growth: If the number of workers and output per worker are both increasing by 1 percent a year, then economic output should rise by roughly 2 percent. Over the past decade, both sides of that equation have declined dramatically across the world. In the United States, productivity growth has fallen by almost half from its postwar average, but growth in the labor force has slid even faster, dropping by   to an average pace of 0. 5 percent, according to calculations performed for my book. Though many explanations have been offered for the slow recovery from the global financial crisis of 2008, the clearest answer may be aging populations. Something will have to fill the void left by, say, retiring farmers, and particularly at a time of rising hostility to immigrants, it is likely to be farmbots. It may not be long before economists are worrying about a global shortage of robots. In many industrial countries, from Germany to Japan to South Korea, growth in the   population has already peaked, acting as a drag on the economy. Widely overlooked, however, is the fact that the   slowdown is unfolding even faster in the emerging world, according to my research. Consider the turning point that China hit last year. For the first time since records began in the 1950s, its   population growth was negative. As a result, China’s labor force is expected to lose 1 million workers each year for the foreseeable future, and it is also aging rapidly. Studies by Evercore ISI, a research firm, show that the elderly share of the population is rising more than twice as fast as it did in the United States and more than four times faster than in France at similar stages of development. Asked by an alarmed dinner companion about the threat robots posed to jobs in China, Nobel economist Daniel Kahneman responded: “You just don’t get it. In China, the robots are going to come just in time. ” No wonder Beijing now offers heavy subsidies to companies involved in industrial automation. And timing is critical. Those who fear the   impact of machines say this generation of technology is different because it is coming so fast. If older generations created tools for use by humans, such as sewing machines, the new forms of automation are imbued with artificial intelligence, capable of “machine learning” and of rapidly replacing humans in a broad swath of jobs, from manufacturing to services  —   even jobs that involve writing about robots. Concern about this disruptive advance has been stirred up by authorities such as Oxford University researchers Carl Benedikt Frey and Michael Osborne, who predicted in 2013 that nearly half of U. S. jobs would be at risk from automation in the next decade or two. These alarms have sounded before, however. The Machine Intelligence Research Institute at the University of California at Berkeley has found that today, the average forecast for when artificial intelligence will arrive is about 20 years. But that was also the standard prediction in 1955. And often, humans find a way of working with their automated creations. After the introduction of supermarket scanners, the number of cashiers grew. Though   software appeared to threaten the jobs of paralegals, their ranks increased, too. Now, many fear that   trucks will displace millions of American truckers, but they may create more and better jobs for those who service those increasingly complex vehicles. If automation was displacing human workers as fast as implied in recent books like Martin Ford’s “The Rise of the Robots,” then we should be seeing a negative impact on jobs already. We’re not. Since 2008, economic growth has been weak compared with that in other   recoveries, but job growth in the major industrial countries has been relatively strong. In the Group of Seven, the world’s top industrial countries, unemployment has fallen faster than expected in the face of weak economic growth, and faster than in any comparable period since at least the 1970s. The Japanese economy is growing at 0. 8 percent, yet it is at full employment. According to my research, the job picture has been particularly strong in Germany, Japan and South Korea  —   the industrial countries that employ the most robots . True, robots do represent a new obstacle for some poorer nations, namely those few that do not suffer from population decline. In the postwar era, countries like China escaped poverty by moving a rising young population off the farm and into more productive jobs in factories. Indeed, it was unusual for any country to sustain rapid growth unless the   population was increasing faster than 2 percent a year. My analysis shows that, in the 1980s, 17 of the 20 largest emerging economies had a   population expanding that fast, according to my research, but now there are only two: Nigeria and Saudi Arabia. And they will have a hard time moving a large segment of their young populations into industrial jobs, given that they now have to compete with robotic manufacturing elsewhere. Yet for the rising number of countries facing population decline, the effort to lift the labor force has begun. Starting in the 1980s, led by Singapore, nations from Chile to Australia have offered baby bonuses for women to have more children, but many have found that these bonuses are ineffective in the face of stronger cultural forces, including the desire of many women to pursue a career before having children. Others have tried with some success to boost the workforce directly by raising the retirement age, offering women incentives to join or return to the labor force after having kids, and opening doors to immigrant workers. The simple math, however, shows that particularly in rapidly aging, conservative societies such as Japan and Germany, none of these groups has the potential to make up for coming declines in the   population. Germany decided to admit roughly 1 million refugees in 2015, in part for economic reasons, but the resulting controversy has reduced the flow. Germany would have to admit 1. 5 million each year through 2030 to fully offset the economic impact of its aging population. Japan, which on average admits fewer than 70, 000 immigrants per year, would have to admit 1 million annually. Given the widespread political backlash against immigration, increases this large are unlikely. So far, robots are drawing comparatively little populist fire, perhaps in part because their numbers are still quite low. Worldwide, the industrial labor force includes about 320 million humans, compared with just 1. 6 million robots. That’s a huge gap, even counting the superior strength and speed of the robots. And most of them fall in the category of unintelligent machines, committed to a single task such as turning a bolt or painting a car door. Nearly half of them work in the auto industry, which is still the largest employer (of humans) in the United States. In the future, economists may start counting robots the way they now count gains in the   population, as a driver of growth. For much of the world, robots will stand alongside immigrants, women and the elderly as a fourth pool of labor. Whether by design or accident, many of the countries with the most rapidly aging populations already have the most robots. According to the International Federation of Robotics, the nations with the highest density of industrial robots include South Korea, with 531 per 10, 000 employees, Japan with 305 and Germany with 301. The United States ranks eighth with 176. China is well behind with only 49, but on the bright side  —   arguably  —   it had the world’s   robot population. Today, population trends are the most powerful force shaping the rise and fall of nations, the starting point of any discussion about an economy’s prospects. Most of the world is graying fast, and the economic answer to aging will be all hands on deck, no matter what they’re made of."
142058,217416,My best trick for staying fit? Telling everyone I used to be fat.,Washington Post,Mike Riggs,2016-11-30,2016.0,11.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161205004132/https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2016/11/30/my-best-trick-for-staying-thin-telling-everyone-i-used-to-be-fat/
","   The author, before and after he lost 90 lbs. (Images courtesy of Mike Riggs)  On my first day at my current job, one of my colleagues brought in a dozen doughnuts to welcome me to the team. I love doughnuts. And pie. And cake and ice cream and french fries and pancakes. But I almost never eat those things anymore. Instead of simply saying no, I declined in the most awkward way possible: I told these friendly people, many of whom I had met only minutes earlier, that I used to be 90 pounds heavier, really didn’t like weighing that much, and now eat garbage only on very special occasions. I’ve delivered that explanation dozens of times over the past two years. Most people react by hemming and hawing. A few folks get defensive. Both reactions are understandable. Not only are my responses incongruous, they are fundamentally impolite. But I do it anyway, because full disclosure is the best tool I have for putting people off. They feel awkward, they don’t want to feel that way again, so they don’t ask a second time, or push me to try something  just this once.  And I’d rather be rude and healthy than compliant and obese.  I worked hard to get my weight under control. I did it because I am vain and because I was scared of dying young. After doing some research, I settled on the following strategy: I maintained a mild weekly calorie deficit by keeping a food journal ; lifted weights several days a week to increase my lean body mass and insulin sensitivity; cut alcohol consumption to a few occasions per month (and no more than three drinks per occasion); and switched from cigarettes to nicotine gum. Introducing those things one by one over several years took me from north of 280 pounds to 195, and lowered my blood pressure from   to  . Was it easy? It was not. But putting a structure in place  —   filling out my food diary every day, keeping my gym appointments come hell or high water  —   made it simple. But as any formerly or currently obese person will tell you, keeping the weight off is exactly the opposite. You can’t rigorously diet forever, but you also can’t eat whenever you feel like it, because you feel like eating all the time and you feel like eating garbage. My way is a good compromise: I don’t weigh my food anymore, but I also don’t eat just because someone puts something in front of my face.         Since that first day, no one at work has offered me doughnuts or candy or any other junk food. Which means for the price of 30 awkward seconds, I have permanently reduced the amount of temptation I will encounter at a place where I spend a significant number of my waking hours. That kind of reprieve is an absolute steal for a recently reformed overeater. Even now I feel like I have gotten away with something. My reaction makes sense. Social science shows that peer pressure is wired into our brains. We take more risks when we’re around others. According to one study, “the human brain places more value on winning in a social setting than it does on winning when you’re alone. ” That makes it much harder to say no to our vices, especially when people ask us to partake again and again. By being honest, I   that conversation. And, as research shows, that minor public dissent gives others permission to lay off (or, in some cases, decide that they, too, would like to forgo a sweet or cigarette). As one writer explained, keeping a budget around friends who wanted to go out for drinks and dinner was hard. The best way to avoid getting pressured was honest communication. “It doesn’t need to be a speech,” Claire Murdough wrote on LifeHacker. “What’s been the most successful has usually been short, sweet and truthful: ‘I want to, but I can’t afford it right now.’ ”  I deploy this awkward honesty for my other vices. When people suggest drinks after work, I tell them I used to have a problem with alcohol, didn’t enjoy how it made me feel and so now don’t drink during the work week. When department store cashiers try to sign me up for credit cards, I tell them it took me years to pay off a credit card I misused when I was younger, and don’t want or need another one. The more I do it, the less embarrassed I feel. It’s not lost on me that this is strange behavior. I wasn’t raised to act like this. In fact, I was raised to say yes to basically everything. Saying no makes me squirm. I’m also a terrible negotiator. By saying, “no, and here’s why” all in one breath, I don’t have to deal with a   offer. The other person is simply too embarrassed (on my behalf) to make one. It also feels really good to politely dissent against cultural norms that were going to kill me. Many of us pay a terrible price for going with the flow when it comes to food and alcohol. Heart disease kills half a million Americans a year, while 86 million people in this country are   and 1 in 6 of us drink eight or more drinks in a sitting four times a month. In essence, many of us are drowning in “yes. ” I didn’t want to die of it. There’s a cruel irony in living this way. Being blunt about my limitations has kept obesity and alcoholism at bay. It also makes me look like someone who can eat doughnuts for breakfast now and again, or attend the occasional happy hour. And I probably can do those things without falling completely off the wagon. But why risk it? After all, the environmental and genetic factors that made me obese are not necessarily gone. I’m still the same person who was diagnosed with high blood pressure at age 13; still the son of a man who needed open heart surgery at age 51; still the adult who said “yes” until he could barely stand to look at himself in a mirror. So now I say no, and I say why, and I plan to keep doing so until the world stops offering me things that I desperately want but definitely shouldn’t have."
142059,217417,Five myths about the decline and fall of Rome,Washington Post,Nathan Pilkington,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161205004132/https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/five-myths-about-the-decline-and-fall-of-rome/2016/12/02/1c06ee5a-b682-11e6-a677-b608fbb3aaf6_story.html
","   Nathan Pilkington is a lecturer in the department of history at Columbia University.    The rise of Donald Trump supposedly heralds the decline of the American idea, according to many of his critics, who’ve taken the opportunity to compare this moment to the fall of Rome’s republic in 31 B. C. or its empire in the 5th century A. D. Any historian is happy when their period of study comes into vogue, but these requiems leave a false impression of Roman antiquity and the causes of its greatest crises.  Myth No. 1 America is going throughwhat republican Rome did. These comparisons are common. Former Supreme Court justice David Souter has said that embracing an   figure who promises to solve the nation’s problems is “how the Roman republic fell. ” Augustus, Rome’s first emperor, ended democracy “because he promised that he would solve problems that were not being solved,” Souter said in the 2012 quote, which resurfaced during this fall’s campaign. Along those same lines, a Huffington Post headline claimed: “Rome Had Caesar. America Has Trump. The People Were and Are Desperate. ”  But such comparisons are light on scholarship. Simply put, most experts believe there is little to compare. Yes, the United States has seen a rise in populism, but it hasn’t experienced a microgram of the violence that accompanied the fall of the Roman republic. The end came only after numerous civil wars over offices and honor  decades of gang violence in the capital, and waves of sanctioned political murder. By that measure, Trump is no Caesar. Myth No. 2 The republic collapsed because of class conﬂict. In a recent article in the Week,   Gobry claimed that “what historians now refer to as the crisis of the Roman Republic had a deeper,   component. ” And as in Rome, he wrote, in   America “there is definitely a patrician class and a plebeian class” that are “at loggerheads. ” In the Daily Beast, Michael Tomasky also found an analogue for America’s turbulence under Trump in Rome’s past: “The patricians and the plebeians had clashed for decades,” he wrote. “It was a class struggle pure and simple. ”  But the struggle between patricians and plebeians took place more than 250 years before the republic’s collapse. During an early republican period known to historians as the Conflict of the Orders  between 494 and 287 B. C. plebeians won the right to have their own magistrates  —   the tribunes  —   and to hold their own assembly to make laws for the entire Roman state. Patricians were excluded from this assembly but bound by its laws. Plebeians also gained election to the consulship, the highest office in Rome. After 366 B. C. normally one of the two consuls was a plebian.  Patricians and plebeians were not “classes” in the modern sense of the term. According to Roman myth, the patricians were descended from the original senators appointed by Rome’s founder, Romulus, to assist him in  . Patrician status was inherited, and plebians made up the rest of society. After the Conflict of the Orders, many plebeians became wealthy and powerful, while certain patrician families saw their fortunes decline and disappeared from history. Pompey the Great, for all his riches and power, was a plebeian from an area colonized in the 3rd century B. C. Emperor Augustus was born a plebeian; it was only when he was adopted by Julius Caesar in his will that he became a patrician.  Myth No. 3 The empire collapsed because of widespread lead poisoning. Professor Jerome Nriagu offered this theory in 1983  and its popularity is rising again because of recent investigations of lead contamination in Rome’s harbor. A 2014 article in Science wondered, “Did Lead Poisoning Bring Down Ancient Rome? ,” concluding that it quite possibly played a role; astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson suggested in an episode of “Cosmos” that lead had a hand in the decline of the empire. Supposedly lead shrunk the population by poisoning the water, leaving the empire weakened and vulnerable. It’s just not true. The argument is predicated on the belief that most Romans used lead pipes to deliver water, lead cauldrons to boil wine, lead as a sweetener and lead in makeup. But the majority of Romans were rural farmers who lived at or barely above subsistence levels; they drank from local or personal wells and lacked the means to regularly indulge in makeup and sweetened wine. Even if the city of Rome did have fairly high levels of lead in its public water system, which some recent skeletal evidence may support, it represented only   of the population of the empire. Lead contamination was never widespread enough to cause fertility problems, mass poisoning or other debilitating illnesses on a sufficient scale to diminish the Roman population and leave it powerless against invading armies.  Myth No. 4 The empire collapsed because of barbarian invasions. In a recent Huffington Post article, political scientist Joseph Nye compared the decay of America to the fall of the Roman Empire, fretting that “an absolute decline in [Rome’s] society, economy and institutions . . . left it unable to protect itself from hordes of invading barbarian tribes. ” Likewise, a Utah State University guide to Rome claims that “barbarian forces overran western Europe, spelling the end of an era. ”  Yet Rome didn’t succumb to a sudden influx of barbarians at the gate. Nor were Goths or other Germanic peoples “barbarian” in the modern sense of the term. They had regularly interacted with the Roman Empire for 200 years and, in many cases, were educated, trained and employed inside its perimeters before they succeeded in destroying imperial authority in Italy, France, the Iberian Peninsula and North Africa during the 5th century A. D. At various times over these two centuries, the tribes served in Roman armies.  Alaric, who famously led the Visigothic migration through the empire to the gates of Rome (  A. D.) started his military career commanding Gothic troops serving in the Roman army. His primary opponent was Stilicho, a     who commanded the armies of the western half of the empire. The eventual rout was no invasion of unknown “hordes,” as Nye put it.  Myth No. 5 The empire collapsed because of Christianity. In his monumental study “The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire,” Edward Gibbon famously proposed that Christianity sparked a decrease in civic duty and a corresponding unwillingness to sacrifice for the empire in its period of greatest stress, ultimately leading (along with barbarian invasions) to its collapse. Because of the widespread acclamation accorded to it, both at the time and by later generations, Gibbon’s work has had unusual longevity. But no modern scholar believes Gibbon’s thesis, if only for the simple fact that a Christian Roman Empire in the east survived the Germanic migration and lived on as the Byzantine Empire for nearly another millennium. Gibbon was also aware of the fact that the Goths were Christian, but he chose to ignore this when assailing the Roman Empire for its adherence to a new faith. All parties at the end of the Roman Empire were Christian.  Thanks to Peter Brown’s magnificent work “The World of Late Antiquity,” most scholars now consider the collapse of the Western Roman Empire to be part of a larger process of transformation, not a decline and fall. Rome had become peripheral to the empire it created, whose center of political and economic life shifted to Constantinople, modern Istanbul, over the course of the 4th century A.

142060,217418,"The Plum Book is here, for those angling for jobs in Trump’s Washington",Washington Post,Lisa Rein,2016-12-04,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161205004132/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2016/12/04/the-plum-book-is-here-for-those-angling-for-jobs-in-trumps-washington/
","    The biggest Help Wanted ad in eight years will materialize in Washington first thing Monday: A   paperback listing 9, 000 political jobs that will be available for those who want to work in Donald Trump’s administration. The   Plum Book  —   so called for the desirable jobs that change hands at the end of a presidential term  —   lists every patronage position in the executive and legislative branches that could be filled by Trump supporters. They’re the policymaking and support positions that will form the spine of the real estate developer’s new government, and they’ll be vacated by the Obama administration by Jan. 20. We only say could be filled, because the   made a campaign promise to shrink the federal bureaucracy  —   and transition officials say he plans to make good on that pledge. So many of these positions could be abolished after Trump takes office in January. The current tally is 2, 000 jobs more than when the George W. Bush administration ended in 2008, a sign that government  —   at least the political positions that reward supporters  —   has grown over eight years. Trump officials said it’s safe to say that the entire bureaucracy, including political appointees, will be significantly scaled back. One transition official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to be candid, described recent conversations on the team as it considers how to shape the federal government in the Trump era. “Oh, they had five people doing that? We’re only going to hire two,” the staff has discussed, according to the official. “In addition to imposing a hiring freeze on all federal employees, which will reduce the federal workforce through attrition, the number of political appointees will drop significantly,” said Cliff Sims, a Trump spokesman. “‘Drain the swamp’ was not just a campaign slogan.   Trump is building a streamlined, innovative government focused on serving the people, not the special interests. ” [Trump has a plan for government workers. They’re not going to like it] The publication’s 10 a. m. release Monday in hard copy at the Government Publishing Office bookstore at 710 N. Capitol St. NW and digitally at www. govinfo. gov (plus through the Plum Book App) also will mark a shift in the newly elected administration’s center of gravity to Washington from Midtown Manhattan. The densely worded volume, to be released by the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee has a wonky title, “Policy and Supporting Positions,” that brings to mind one of the government’s more   publications. Yet the Plum Book is a mother lode for job seekers, from ambassadors to secretaries, all over the world. The Washington Post obtained an early copy. There will be opportunities for Trump supporters in Alabama, for example, where three U. S. Marshals are now stationed. The new administration will be looking for an assistant secretary for nuclear energy at the Energy Department and a deputy associate commissioner for systems electronic services at the Social Security Administration. The Republic of Palau will need an ambassador, and Sudan will need a special envoy. The Postal Regulatory Commission will be hiring a general counsel. The Barry Goldwater Scholarship and Excellence in Education Foundation will have nine openings. There are high salaries  —   by government standards  —   and low ones. The confidential assistant in the Office of White House Liaison at the Commerce Department is now a   making somewhere between $43, 684 and $56, 790. The U. S. attorney for the Virgin Islands, meanwhile, brings in $160, 300. Some of the many commissions listed are unsalaried, except for per diem and travel expenses.      Since his victory in November, Trump has been meeting at Trump Tower with dozens of potential picks for his new Cabinet. When their nominations are complete, the focus will turn to the transition team vetting résumés at the General Services Administration headquarters at 1800 F St. NW. How many résumés? As of Friday, 65, 800 men and women had applied to serve in the Trump administration through the website GreatAgain. gov, transition officials said. The team’s Washington operation has been quietly sifting through these applications for weeks to choose the most qualified and talented candidates, categorizing them into which agency they want to work for. The group is led by Rick Dearborn, the transition’s executive director. Now Dearborn’s staff will have specific jobs to match with the résumés. Hiring decisions aren’t being made just yet, though. After the Cabinet choices, a second wave of decisions will focus on positions like the secretaries of the various military branches and key deputies for the Cabinet, many of whom will require Senate confirmation. The political appointments under them and thousands of positions known as “Schedule C” jobs, for    candidates who do not need a green light from the Senate, will come next.    (Allie Ghaman, The Washington Post)  The number of vacancies is subject to interpretation. While the Plum Book’s foreword says it includes more than 9, 000 jobs, hundreds of these are appointments, either   or   to   boards and commissions. Hundreds more are nonpolitical jobs occupied by civil servants  —   for example, those in the senior executive service. They’re listed because the president could convert some of these positions to political appointments if they are vacant. Experts in the presidential appointment process say the ones to focus on come to about 4, 100. “The real jobs are the 4, 100,” said Terry Sullivan, a political scientist at the University of North Carolina and executive director of the White House Transition Project, which provides information to incoming administrations, focusing on the White House. “Almost none of the civil service jobs listed are going to turn over, but any one of them could,” he said. The 4, 100 positions have grown from 3, 653 just four years ago. All of the political jobs are at will, as opposed to nonpolitical civil servants, which means they will serve at the pleasure of the president. They require political connections, which will make things interesting for a president who until now has had no federal government experience. The plummiest positions are likely to go to retired members of Congress, defeated member of Congress, friends and associates of the   and his family, top advisers and people the Cabinet appointees have worked with and trust. Trump had a limited field operation, but the Republican National Committee brought in an extensive team of campaign workers and volunteers who would be likely candidates for some positions, if they know how to network.    The 1968 Plum Book, which was then brown (Government Publishing Office)  The Plum Book has been a presidential ritual since the incoming Eisenhower administration produced the first comprehensive political job list in 1952. With Democrats controlling patronage jobs in the two decades before, Republicans pressed for a list of government jobs they could fill. The book appeared again in 1960 and has been published since after every presidential election. It contains listings of jobs by department and agency, the type of appointment for each position, the names of those currently in the job, and, in many cases, salary levels. As of last summer, when the Office of Personnel Management provided the listings to the Trump and Hillary Clinton campaigns for planning purposes, some jobs were vacant. The Plum Book has not always been plum. The cover has appeared in Sand Gray (read: brownish) and Killarney Green (read: avocado). Not surprisingly, there’s more interest when a president is about to leave office than after one term. Sales of printed copies in 2008, as Obama prepared to move into the White House, were 2, 140, with 225, 000 online views. In 2012, 210 copies were printed with 18, 700 digital views. Some top federal jobs, like the FBI and IRS directors, have fixed terms that won’t shift with the administration. Some open positions may not be filled for months or even years. There are several ways the number of jobs can creep up. Agencies have flexibility to create new political positions at both low and  . Congress also creates new jobs in legislation, like the Puerto Rico Oversight Commission, the International Exchange Rate Commission and the   Consumer Product Safety Commission, which currently has 28 political appointees. All came into existence during the Obama administration."
142061,217419,N.C. man told police he went to D.C. pizzeria with assault rifle to ‘self-investigate’ election-related conspiracy theory,Washington Post,Susan Svrluga,2016-12-04,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161205004132/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/local/wp/2016/12/04/d-c-police-respond-to-report-of-a-man-with-a-gun-at-comet-ping-pong-restaurant/
","         A North Carolina man was arrested Sunday after he walked into a popular pizza restaurant in Northwest Washington carrying an assault rifle and fired one or more shots, D. C. police said. The man told police he had come to the restaurant to “ ” an   conspiracy theory involving Hillary Clinton that spread online during her presidential campaign. The incident caused panic, with several businesses going into lockdown as police swarmed the neighborhood after receiving the call shortly before 3 p. m. Police said    Edgar Maddison Welch, of Salisbury, N. C. walked in the front door of Comet Ping Pong and pointed a firearm in the direction of a restaurant employee. The employee was able to flee and notify police. Police said Welch proceeded to discharge the rifle inside the restaurant. He has been charged with assault with a dangerous weapon. Police initially said it was unclear what the motive for the shooting was but many in the neighborhood had suspected it might be related to “PizzaGate. ” The popular family restaurant, near Connecticut and Nebraska avenues NW in the Chevy Chase neighborhood, was swept up in the onslaught of fake news and conspiracy theories that was prevalent during the presidential campaign. The restaurant, its owner, staff and nearby businesses have been attacked on social media and received death threats. Startled patrons rushed out of the restaurant onto Connecticut Avenue, taking shelter in nearby businesses that remained locked down for more than an hour. Vivek Jain, of Potomac, Md. was eating lunch inside Banana Leaf, a nearby Indian restaurant, when Comet patrons came rushing inside. He said Banana Leaf was locked down for about 90 minutes. “A bunch of people ran in from Comet and said a man walked in with a gun,” Jain said. About 45 minutes later, he said, he saw a man walking backward out into the street with his hands in the air. “He laid down on Connecticut Avenue and he was immediately picked up by the police and taken away,” he said. Police said in addition to the assault rifle, they also recovered two firearms inside the restaurant; an additional weapon was recovered in Welch’s car.   dogs and at least one armored vehicle were present at the scene. The restaurant’s owner and employees were threatened on social media in the days before the election after fake news stories circulated claiming that   presidential nominee Hillary Clinton and her campaign chief were running a child sex ring from the restaurant’s back rooms. Even Michael Flynn, a retired general who   Donald Trump has tapped to advise him on national security, shared the stories. None of them were true. But the fake stories and threats persisted, some even aimed at the employees’ children. The restaurant’s owner was forced to contact the FBI, local police, Facebook and other social media platforms in an effort to remove the articles. James Alefantis, the owner of Comet Ping Pong, did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment Sunday. Last month, citing its policy against posting the personal information of others, Reddit banned the “pizzagate” topic. But it didn’t stop the harassment and nearby businesses have received threats as well, according to police. On Sunday, after spending more than an hour on lockdown with employees and customers, Matt Carr, the owner of the Little Red Fox market and coffee shop, said his business started getting threats last weekend. They got 30 to 40 calls before they stopped answering calls from blocked numbers, he said. “One person said he wanted to line us up in front of a firing squad. ” The threats were all tied to the Comet Ping Pong accusations online, he said. “There’s some old   symbol on the marquee that they claim is an international symbol of pedophilia, and that there are underground tunnels. . . . There’s some video on YouTube that has almost 100, 000 views and talks about me, the owner of the Little Red Fox, by name. “This was our worst fear,” he said, “that someone would read all this and come to the block with a gun. And today it happened. ” Politics and Prose, the bookstore that has been a Washington institution and neighborhood fixture for more than 30 years, was in the midst of a book event when they saw police converging on the block, said Bradley Graham, a store  . Like other businesses on the block, they had gotten threats recently, he said, and were planning to meet with police Monday afternoon “because we had feared that what, up to now, had been simply despicable menacing verbal attacks online or on the phone might escalate. ” Graham said he was told that the gunman walked into the kitchen at Comet Ping Pong, “presumably looking for the alleged tunnels” where children were hidden and tortured. Graham believes that information came from an employee at the restaurant. He said the businesses are hoping to get more police protection, “and we would also hope that law enforcement authorities will be prompted to take additional measures to shut down the sites where this hateful material is being spread, and also measures to try to trace the menacing phone calls. “. . . We’re all rather shaken,” he said.  “Political figures have the means to deal with conspiratorial allegations and threats, but your neighborhood mom and pop shop does not,” Carr said later in an email. “I make coffee and breakfast burritos for a living. This is out of our league. ” D. C. Council member Mary Cheh (  3) was getting gas down the street from Comet Ping Pong and saw what she described as intense police activity around the restaurant. Cheh said she spoke with Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) who had been briefed by police, and learned that the man taken into custody is apparently from North Carolina. He had an assault rifle and another weapon on him in the restaurant and “another weapon or weapons” in his vehicle. She didn’t know if his actions could be connected the false rumors surrounding Comet Ping Pong. “It’s very, very worrisome,” Cheh said. “I’m just very worried that [the rumors] may have unleashed people who are unstable to pursue violent action, as has happened before. ” She praised the speed of the police response that may have prevented an attack. “It all looked so efficient and professional. I was very pleased it was locked down so quickly. ” On Sunday, Gareth Wade, 47, and Doug Clarke, 50, were sitting down for pizza and beer at Comet when they spotted a commotion. All of a sudden, said Wade, “the server said someone just walked in with a shotgun. ” “A man had just walked into the building, passed us into the back of the building, he seemed to have a shotgun or a   of [gun] and said we ought to vacate the building,” Wade recalled the server saying. They rushed out of the restaurant and had planned to head to Politics and Prose, the nearby bookstore, where Clarke’s wife and    took shelter, but they got separated. Clarke and Wade were met by a heavy police presence when they attempted to join up. “Police said you can’t go to the bookstore,” Wade said. They ended up behind the police barricade at Connecticut Avenue and Fessenden Street. Clarke’s wife and son were forced to remain inside the bookstore. Meanwhile, Clarke was trying to reunite his son with a present he’d received for his fifth birthday this weekend, a stuffed lion that they were forced to leave inside the restaurant. “He’s kind of shaken up about the whole thing,” Clarke said. “We’ve been talking a lot about it and trying to help him understand. That he was a man with a weapon, weapons are bad  —   he was not a nice person. ”      Police secure the scene near Comet Ping Pong in Chevy Chase. (Sarah L.

142062,217420,"Fidel Castro laid to rest in private, closed-door funeral",Washington Post,Nick Miroff,2016-12-04,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161205004132/https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/cuba-carries-fidel-castro-to-final-resting-place/2016/12/03/a324155a-b8d2-11e6-b994-f45a208f7a73_story.html
","  SANTIAGO DE CUBA —   The details of Fidel Castro’s private life were a state secret for most of the 47 years that he ruled Cuba, and his   funeral Sunday morning was no different.  The ceremony was not carried live on television, leaving Cubans without a parting image of the figure whose   socialist system has determined virtually every aspect of their lives.  The government said Castro’s ashes were interred in a simple ceremony at the Santa Ifigenia cemetery in this city, the country’s second largest, alongside the tombs of Cuba’s most exalted national heroes.  Hours later, Cuban state media published photographs showing Raul Castro pushing his brother’s casket into a tomb fashioned from a 2.  granite boulder, and sealed with an   plaque that simply reads “FIDEL. ”  The tomb’s    Castro as an enduring, immovable, geological    is not subtle.   Cuban President Raúl Castro, right, acknowledges the crowd after speaking during a final homage to his late brother Fidel Castro, held at Antonio Maceo plaza in Santiago de Cuba on Dec. 3. (Desmond  )  A military caravan carrying his ashes in a small,   cedar casket was seen entering the cemetery Sunday morning at around 7, after hundreds of thousands of Cubans staged an   vigil in the nearby Plaza of the Revolution.  Castro’s funeral Sunday ends the   period of national mourning ordered by the government after his death Nov. 25 at age 90. He ruled Cuba from 1959 to 2006, when illness forced him to step aside and transfer power to his younger brother Raul.  Castro’s ashes arrived in Santiago on Saturday after a   journey across the island, as Cubans lined the highway waving flags in the hot sun, chanting, “I am Fidel! I am Fidel!”  The government said 500, 000 attended a final tribute to Castro on Saturday night, where Raul Castro, 85, said the government would not erect statues or monuments in his brother’s honor, or rename parks and streets after him.  “He never wanted any kind of personality cult, and that was his wish up until his final moments,” Castro said of his brother. “He insisted that he didn’t want his name or his image used as the title of institutions, plazas, parks, avenues, streets or other public places, nor the construction of monuments, busts, statues and others forms of tribute. ”  Castro added he would propose laws to make sure his brother’s wishes were honored.  It was meant perhaps as a final, posthumous retort to the criticisms of Castro’s enemies, who depicted him as a   megalomaniac obsessed with his own public image.  Though Cubans saw Castro on television nearly every day for a   little was known about his family life, and his   companion, Dalia Soto del Valle, is not a public figure and rarely appears in state media images. The government has not revealed Castro’s cause of death, but his healthy had steadily declined in recent years, and his final public appearances were in a wheelchair.  During his speech, Raul Castro also assured Cubans them that his brother “never lost faith in victory” and that the country’s socialist system would endure.  “Few in the world believed in our ability to resist and overcome,” said Castro, recalling the worst years of Cuba’s   economic crisis, when the country suffered food shortages and chronic blackouts. “Fidel showed us that it was possible,” he said.  Former Brazilian president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva and his recently impeached successor, Dilma Rousseff, joined Castro on the dais along with other Latin American leftist leaders. Several of the Fidel Castro’s celebrity friends, including Argentine soccer star Diego Maradona and U. S. actor Danny Glover, also made the trip to Santiago.  The public displays of emotion and sorrow seemed to intensify over the course of the week, as Cuban state media broadcast    tributes.  The initial reaction to his death had been somewhat muted in the capital, Havana, with few spontaneous displays of grief. But here in Santiago mourners gave tearful interviews to state television, hoisting   photos of Castro as a child, as a guerrilla commander in the mountains and later a   commander in chief.  Silverio Maldonado, 54, a cook at a pizzeria and veteran of Castro’s military intervention in Angola, stood outside the cemetery with a crowd of several hundred others. A phalanx of plainclothes Cuban security agents blocked access to the site.  “Fidel had a way of penetrating the hearts of all Cubans,” Maldonado said. “When my parents died two years ago, I felt like I still had a father because he was there. ”  He waved off the idea that Cuba might change more without Castro as a living symbol of his   socialist state. “What we need now is unity,” said Maldonado. “We need to be just like ants, carrying out the wishes of our commander. ”  The Santa Ifigenia cemetery that is Castro’s final resting place includes the tombs of Cuban national hero Jose Martí and Carlos Manuel de Cespedes, who launched Cuba’s first war of independence against Spanish colonial rule.  Santiago de Cuba is considered the “birthplace” of Castro’s Cuban Revolution. The prosperous Castro family estate was 60 miles to the north, and starting at age 7 Fidel Castro spent much of his childhood at Jesuit boarding schools.   In 1953 he led a bloody, botched assault on the city’s military garrison, his first attempt to overthrow the military government of Gen. Fulgencio Batista. A trained lawyer, he used his own defense to deliver a   indictment of Batista’s rule, famously telling the court: “Condemn Me! It doesn’t matter. History will absolve me!”  Castro’s 1956 to 1959 guerrilla campaign in the mountains outside the city finally drove Batista from power on Dec. 31, 1958, and he arrived in Santiago the next day to declare victory in the central square.

142063,217421,Let’s make the College Football Playoff twice as good and add four more teams,Washington Post,Barry Svrluga,2016-12-04,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161205004132/https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/colleges/lets-make-the-college-football-playoff-twice-as-good-and-add-four-more-teams/2016/12/04/33e0f064-ba71-11e6-ac85-094a21c44abc_story.html
"," The strength of those who run college football  —   not from the days when two different polls could create two different national champions up to this very year, when we are graced with a college football playoff  —   has never been getting it right. So why start now?  What people were left to discuss both before and after Sunday’s announcement of the four teams that will take part in the College Football Playoff was the perceived injustice of Big Ten champion Penn State  —   which won its conference and beat Ohio State  —   being left out.  “You wake up every day to become a champion of your conference,” said Ohio State Coach Urban Meyer.  Well, unless you’re like Meyer, and you wake up, find you didn’t even earn a spot in your conference championship game, discover that doesn’t matter  —   and you’ll play in a national semifinal anyway.  What people should be discussing instead of Ohio State going over Penn State, or for that matter Washington getting in over, say, Michigan: Four national quarterfinal games, all staged in the home stadiums of the higher seeds. An   playoff wouldn’t forever rid us of the rancor the College Football Playoff committee has provided. But it would grant this: Each champion of the   power five conferences with an automatic berth, and three   spots  —   this year, say, Ohio State, Michigan and USC.  Let’s have Alabama against USC. Let’s put Ohio State up against Oklahoma  —   the Big 12 champion, which was an afterthought in this year’s discussion. Clemson against Michigan. Washington against Penn State.  Now that’s a playoff.  (Want to leave a spot for the little people? Fine. Take the top team, annually, from the   Group of Five  —   this year, Western Michigan  —   and give it a seat at the table. Whatever. There are lots of solutions.) That we have arrived at this particular chaos just three years into a   deal for the playoff  —   actually, it runs through 2025 but could clearly be altered  —   could be one reason to pump the brakes on change. The way things fall in a certain season  —   this season yielding semifinals of Alabama against Washington and Clemson against Ohio State  —   doesn’t make adjusting to fit that scenario right.  The people charged with assembling this format, a process that dates back to 2011, ran through what seemed to be all the possible models  —   four teams, six teams, eight teams, even 16 teams  —   in devising this system. These people aren’t academics. They are athletic directors and television executives, consultants and conference officials. But they must take their cues from academics, who must in turn give at least a cursory, public nod to, well, academics.   Thus, one of the parameters laid out by the Presidential Oversight Committee  —   whose loose mission is to make us as much money as possible without making it look like they’re trying make as much money as possible  —   is that college football should not be what they called a “  sport. ” So, then, the presidents put a cap on the latest a championship game could be played. They are currently scheduled through the   season, with none later than Jan. 13.  But would pushing it one week later matter? Of course not. First, it would affect two teams  —   two schools  —   every year. Presumably, the players at Wake Forest and New Mexico wouldn’t be so distracted by an extra week of playoffs that they couldn’t begin their studies. Second, it’s already a   sport. This year, Washington begins classes Jan. 3, Michigan on Jan. 4, Ohio State on Jan. 9, and Clemson and Alabama on Jan. 11  —   the very day of the national championship game.  Don’t cry over those missed chemistry classes. They can be made up. Don’t like that solution? Start the season a week earlier, in August, giving college football another full slate of games free of NFL competition and attention. Either way, don’t decry an   playoff in the name of   welfare, because it is at best lip service anyway. So this year, the   calendar would look like this: Conference championship games the weekend of Dec. 3, just as they were; a week off Dec. 10; quarterfinals Dec. 17; a week off before the semifinals (and for Christmas) semifinals on New Year’s Eve, championship game on Monday, Jan. 9  —   which is when it will be played anyway. This is not a universally held worldview. “We have the best sport out there because every game truly matters,” Clemson Coach Dabo Swinney said Sunday. “If we keep expanding, to me the season gets very watered down. ” The subtext of that argument: College football doesn’t want to be college basketball, which does its best to hide from public view for 11 months, explodes in March, then hibernates again. And that’s fine. The regular season should matter. But we already have a regular season in which Penn State beat Ohio State, in which Penn State won the Big Ten, and Ohio State advanced anyway. The regular season didn’t matter much for the Nittany Lions. This isn’t even to say Penn State is a better team than Ohio State. (Total offensive yards in the Buckeyes’   loss: 413 for Ohio State, 276 for Penn State .) It is to say this: If the regular season is supposed to matter, and you wake up every day of the regular season to become a champion of your conference, the major conference champions should be able to play for the national title. The only way to ensure that: add another layer of games, which would only provide the best weekend of football all year long. "

Why he may not face charges.",Washington Post,Kristine Guerra,2016-12-04,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161205004132/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/true-crime/wp/2016/12/04/a-man-punched-a-crying-baby-boy-so-hard-he-died-police-say-why-he-may-not-face-charges/
","     Kenneth Johnson had confessed that he punched a    in the stomach after becoming frustrated over the child’s crying, police said. The boy died of internal injuries in Fresno, Calif. according to the coroner’s office. His death had been ruled a homicide. But the confession was not enough to charge Johnson for the child’s death. The    man, who was the boyfriend of the child’s babysitter, was released from Fresno County Jail after District Attorney Lisa Smittcamp declined to file charges against him. “What must be considered in all cases, is that while statements of an accused individual may be used against them, the law requires that there be other evidence of the crime independent of the accused’s statement in order to file criminal charges or obtain a conviction,” the Fresno County District Attorney’s Office said in a statement on Friday.  Johnson was arrested earlier this week after, authorities say, he admitted hurting Jose Luis Espinoza III in November. Detectives obtained the confession following a lengthy interrogation, Fresno Police Chief Jerry Dyer told reporters during a news conference on Wednesday. Dyer said police were called to an apartment complex in Fresno at about 2:40 p. m. on Nov. 20. The child was found unconscious and was later pronounced dead at an area hospital. The child’s babysitter, a    woman who was not named, told detectives that she was cleaning the apartment when the boy’s older sister, a    said he wasn’t breathing, Dyer told reporters. Doctors did not find visible signs of injuries. But over the next two days, initial autopsy results revealed that the child had internal trauma, leading the coroner’s office to rule the death a homicide, Dyer said. Detectives honed in on Johnson, who was seen on video surveillance leaving the apartment just before 3 p. m. on Nov. 20. At that time, Johnson also was in violation of a   restraining order imposed by the court after an earlier domestic dispute between him and the babysitter. Johnson admitted being at the apartment complex, but denied hurting the child. Dyer said detectives were not convinced and interrogated him again on Tuesday  —   this time for three hours. Johnson confessed and was immediately arrested on a preliminary murder charge, Dyer told reporters. Johnson was released about two days later after the county district attorney declined to file charges, saying the agency needed more information from the coroner’s office. In the statement, the agency outlined ethical considerations that prosecutors must take into account in filing criminal charges. The district attorney’s office said that prosecutors file charges only if there has been a complete and thorough investigation, if there is enough admissible evidence that a crime had actually occurred and a suspect had committed it, and if there is a probability of conviction.  A person’s confession is not enough, according to the statement. “The Fresno County District Attorney’s Office remains committed to identifying and prosecuting those individuals who commit crimes on the young and vulnerable in our county,” the agency said, declining to comment further on the case. The child’s mother, who lives in the same apartment with the babysitter, was in Modesto, more than 90 miles northwest of Fresno. In a statement, Dyer said the district attorney has not requested more information from detectives, but has asked for further examination from the coroner’s office, the Fresno Bee reported. He said investigators remain confident that Johnson is responsible for the child’s death. Johnson was followed by reporters and cameras as he walked out of jail earlier this week. “I just apologize for the situation. I just don’t know right now,” he told ABC affiliate  . “Can I just not comment right now, please?” A reporter asked why he was at the apartment despite the restraining order against him. Johnson said it was a “peaceful contact. ” The infant’s funeral was held on Friday. Efforts to reach his mother, Lakeisha Colbert, on Saturday were unsuccessful.

142065,217429,"Trump’s Taiwan phone call was long planned, say people who were involved",Washington Post,Anne Gearan,2016-12-04,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161206001457/https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trumps-taiwan-phone-call-was-weeks-in-the-planning-say-people-who-were-involved/2016/12/04/f8be4b0c-ba4e-11e6-94ac-3d324840106c_story.html
"," Donald Trump’s   telephone call with Taiwan’s leader was an intentionally provocative move that establishes the incoming president as a break with the past, according to interviews with people involved in the planning. The historic communication  —   the first between leaders of the United States and Taiwan since 1979  —   was the product of months of quiet preparations and deliberations among Trump’s advisers about a new strategy for engagement with Taiwan that began even before he became the Republican presidential nominee, according to people involved in or briefed on the talks. The call also reflects the views of   advisers urging Trump to take a tough opening line with China, said others familiar with the months of discussion about Taiwan and China. Trump and his advisers have sought to publicly portray the call the   took from Taiwan President Tsai    on Friday as a routine congratulatory call. Trump noted on Twitter that she placed the call. “He took the call, accepted her congratulations and good wishes and it was precisely that,” Vice   Mike Pence said Sunday on ABC’s “This Week. ”     Vice   Mike Pence and   Donald Trump’s senior transition adviser Kellyanne Conway on Dec. 4 defended Trump’s phone call with Taiwan’s leader Tsai  . (Bastien   Washington Post)   That glosses over the extensive and turbulent history of U. S. relations with Taiwan and the political importance the island and its democracy hold for many Republican foreign policy specialists. Some critics portrayed the move as the thoughtless blundering of a foreign policy novice, but other experts said it appeared calculated to signal a new, robust approach to relations with China. China reacted sternly to the Taiwan call, suggesting that it shows Trump’s inexperience.    Trump sent two Twitter messages Sunday that echoed his   blasts against China.       Donald Trump’s campaign manager Kellyanne Conway downplayed the fervor over his phone call with Taiwan’s president. ”All he did was receive a phone call. I think everybody should just calm down. He’s aware of what our nation’s policy is,” she said. (Reuters)   “Did China ask us if it was OK to devalue their currency (making it hard for our companies to compete) heavily tax our products going into their country (the U. S. doesn’t tax them) or to build a massive military complex in the middle of the South China Sea?” he asked. “I don’t think so!” The United States does impose a tax on Chinese goods  —   2. 9 percent for   goods and 2. 5 percent for agricultural products. Some of the GOP’s most ardent Taiwan proponents are playing active roles in Trump’s transition team, and others in the conservative foreign policy community see a historic opportunity to reset relations with Taiwan and reposition it as a more strategic ally in East Asia. Several leading members of Trump’s transition team are considered hawkish on China and friendly toward Taiwan, including incoming chief of staff Reince Priebus. Indeed, advisers explicitly warned last month that relations with China were in for a  . In an article for Foreign Policy magazine titled “Donald Trump’s Peace Through Strength Vision for the ” Peter Navarro and Alexander Gray described Taiwan as a “beacon of democracy in Asia” and complained that its treatment by the Obama administration was “egregious. ” The article, flagged to China experts as a significant policy blueprint, described Taiwan as “the most militarily vulnerable U. S. partner anywhere in the world” and called for a comprehensive arms deal to help it defend itself against China. Friday’s phone call does not necessarily mean that will happen, but it does look like the first sign of a recalibration by a future Trump administration, experts say. It was planned weeks ahead by staffers and Taiwan specialists on both sides, according to people familiar with the plans. Immediately after Trump won the Nov. 8 election, his staffers compiled a list of foreign leaders with whom to arrange calls. “Very early on, Taiwan was on that list,” said Stephen Yates, a national security official during the presidency of George W. Bush and an expert on China and Taiwan. “Once the call was scheduled, I was told that there was a briefing for   Trump. They knew that there would be reaction and potential blowback. ”    Alex Huang, a spokesman for Tsai, told the Reuters news agency, “Of course both sides agreed ahead of time before making contact. ” Tsai’s office said she had told Trump during the phone call that she hoped the United States “would continue to support more opportunities for Taiwan to participate in international issues. ” Tsai will have sympathetic ears in the White House. Priebus is reported to have visited Taiwan with a Republican delegation in 2011 and in October 2015, meeting Tsai before she was elected president. Taiwan Foreign Minister David Lee called him a friend of Taiwan and said his appointment as Trump’s chief of staff was “good news” for the island, according to local news media. Edward J. Feulner, a longtime former president of the Heritage Foundation, has for decades cultivated extensive ties with Taiwan and is serving as an adviser to Trump’s transition team. At the Republican National Convention in July, Trump’s allies inserted a   phrase into the party’s platform reaffirming support for six key assurances to Taiwan made by President Ronald Reagan in 1982  —   a priority for the Taiwan government. Also written into the 2016 platform was tougher language about China than had been in the party’s platform in its previous iteration four years ago. “We salute the people of Taiwan, with whom we share the values of democracy, human rights, a free market economy, and the rule of law,” the platform said, adding that the current documents governing U. S.  relations should stand but adding, “China’s behavior has negated the optimistic language of our last platform concerning our future relations with China. ” Yates, who helped write that portion of the platform, said Trump made clear at the time that he wanted to recalibrate relationships around the world and that the U. S. posture toward China was “a personal priority. ” About the same time, Navarro, one of Trump’s top economic and Asia advisers, penned an   saying that the United States must not “dump Taiwan” and needs a comprehensive strategy to bolster what he termed “a beacon of democracy. ” The  ’s advisers have said the communication does not signify any formal shift in   U. S. relations with Taiwan or China, even as they acknowledge that the decision to break with nearly 40 years of U. S. diplomatic practice was a calculated choice. “Of course all    calls are well planned,” said Richard Grenell, a former State Department official who has advised the Trump transition effort. Grenell and others noted that the call came about two weeks after Trump had spoken with Chinese President Xi Jinping and that it was not substantive. “There was no policy discussion, and everyone involved is well aware of the ‘One China’ policy,” Grenell said, referring to the   shift that established formal direct ties between Washington and Beijing. The United States maintains a military relationship with Taiwan, which Beijing considers a province, but closed its embassy there in 1979. Republican administrations since then have emphasized Taiwan’s democracy and flirted with the idea of a shift in policy, but none have held public discussions with a Taiwanese leader. “There are a lot of things that previous Republican presidents, and Democratic presidents, would do that Donald Trump won’t do,” Grenell said. “He’s a man that understands that typical Washington rules are not always best for our foreign policy. ” During the campaign, Trump’s fiery rhetoric against China resonated with his supporters, especially those in the economically beleaguered Rust Belt states where he registered unexpected wins. Trump accused China of “raping” the United States by stealing trade secrets, manipulating its currency and subsidizing its industries. He vowed to institute tough new policies designed to crack down on the Chinese and extract concessions, such as by imposing higher tariffs on goods manufactured there.       By irritating if not angering the Chinese government with his talk with Tsai, Trump showed his core supporters in the United States that he would follow through with his promise to get tough on China, some observers said. “He campaigned on an ‘America first’ platform,” GOP pollster Frank Luntz said. “Calls like this may upset the diplomats, but they communicate to Americans that he’s not going to play by the same rules and isn’t just talking differently but will act differently. ” Walter Lohman, director of the Heritage Foundation’s Asian Studies Center, said the call with Tsai “was deliberate. It was not an accident. Obviously he made a conscious decision to have the call arranged. She called him, but there was an agreement for it. ”  Gordon Chang, an Asia expert and author of “ The Coming Collapse of China” said Trump’s tweet Friday night that he had just accepted a call from Tsai was “not credible. ”   “This has all the hallmarks of a prearranged phone call,” Chang said. “It doesn’t make sense that Tsai out of the blue would call Donald Trump. She is not known for taking big leaps into the unknown, and it would be politically embarrassing when it was learned that she called Trump and he would not take her call. ”   Kellyanne Conway, a senior adviser to Trump’s transition team, brushed aside questions about what the call signals about the incoming administration’s priorities and policy on China. “All he did was receive a phone call,” Conway told reporters Sunday at Trump Tower in New York. “Everybody should just calm down. He’s aware of what our nation’s policy is. ”  Denyer reported from Beijing. "

","            Donald Trump has nominated retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson to run the Department of Housing and Urban Development, an unconventional choice that underscores Trump’s willingness to forgo traditional policy expertise in some Cabinet positions to surround himself with allies. Carson  —   who ran against Trump in the wide field of Republican presidential primary candidates and has never held political office  —   is the  ’s   African American supporter and confidant. A conservative political celebrity, the    Carson recently cast doubt on his suitability for a Cabinet role, saying he would be “like a fish out of water” as a federal bureaucrat. “I am thrilled to nominate Dr. Ben Carson as our next Secretary of the U. S. Department of Housing and Urban Development,” Trump is quoted as saying in a statement released by his transition team Monday. “Ben Carson has a brilliant mind and is passionate about strengthening communities and families within those communities. ” A review of some of Carson’s political commentary on housing policy reveals his views to be at odds with some of the   policies championed by minority groups, including the NAACP. On at least one occasion, he criticized efforts by the Obama administration to use its regulatory powers to improve racial integration in housing.  If confirmed by the Senate, Carson will be enlisted to serve as Trump’s unofficial envoy to African Americans and to lead the charge to repair what Trump has described as America’s blighted and dangerous inner cities, a dystopian, racially charged image criticized as frequently at odds with reality. He will also lead Trump’s efforts in an arena where Trump and members of his family have been accused of flouting the law in their own business ventures. Trump is also expected on Monday to formally name retired Marine Gen. James N. Mattis as his defense secretary. Trump shared his intentions Thursday during a raucous “thank you” rally in Cincinnati. Carson’s lack of experience in the housing sphere raised concerns among advocates for vulnerable Americans. “With many qualified Republicans to choose from with deep knowledge of, and commitment to, affordable housing solutions for the poorest families, and with the housing crisis reaching new heights across the country, Dr. Carson’s nomination to serve as HUD Secretary is surprising and concerning,” Diane Yentel, president of the National Low Income Housing Coalition, said in a statement. Trump’s HUD pick follows his decision to name South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley (R) the daughter of Indian immigrants, as ambassador to the United Nations and former labor secretary Elaine L. Chao as his choice for transportation secretary. Chao in 2001 became the first Asian American woman to be named to a Cabinet post and went on to head the Labor Department under President George W. Bush for eight years. These two appointments, along with Carson’s and Trump’s selection of Betsy DeVos as his choice for education secretary, confirm that the   is seeking a measure of racial and gender diversity in his emerging administration.  Carson and the   were not always as friendly as they are now. In November 2015, as the Republican presidential primary cycle was heating up, Trump used Carson’s description of himself as a violent adolescent to attack his rival at campaign rallies. Noting Carson’s admissions in his 1996 autobiography, interviews and public statements that, growing up, he had tried to attack his mother with a hammer and almost stabbed a friend, Trump said Carson had a “pathological temper” that was incurable, comparing it to “child molesting. ” “If you’re a child molester, a sick puppy, a child molester, there’s no cure for that,” Trump said in Fort Dodge, Iowa. “There’s only one cure, and we don’t want to talk about that cure. That’s the ultimate cure. No, there’s two  —   there’s death and the other thing. But if you’re a child molester, there’s no cure, they can’t stop you. Pathological, there’s no cure. ”   With Ben Carson wanting to hit his mother on head with a hammer, stab a friend and Pyramids built for grain storage  —   don’t people get it?  —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 6, 2015   Carson was also critical of Trump at times, but without the same level of intensity. He said in March that he might have “preferred” a different Republican presidential nominee but that “we’re only looking at four years” if Trump fails as president. A   Adventist, Carson entered the political sphere after admonishing the audience at the 2013 National Prayer Breakfast  —   including President Obama. Standing a short distance from Obama, he said the United States faced “moral decay” and “fiscal irresponsibility” similar to the end of the Roman Empire. Soon, he was making the rounds as a commentator in print and on Fox News, where he was often featured as a critical voice on the Affordable Care Act. Carson does not have specific experience with the activities of HUD, which manages   housing assistance, facilitates financing for homeownership and administers   programs. But he has a documented position on   policies that has advocates nervous about what protections a Trump administration might dismantle  —   particularly for racial desegregation. Last year,   Carson forcefully criticized an Obama administration rule requiring cities and towns to publicly report racial bias in their housing patterns, saying it would “fundamentally change” communities by requiring affordable housing to be built in wealthier neighborhoods. “These   attempts to legislate racial equality create consequences that often make matters worse,” Carson wrote in the Washington Times. “There are reasonable ways to use housing policy to enhance the opportunities available to   citizens, but based on the history of failed socialist experiments in this country, entrusting the government to get it right can prove downright dangerous. ” Trump and members of his family have come under scrutiny for allegedly flouting   laws in their own real estate business. In 1973, the Justice Department sued Trump and his father, Fred Trump, for allegedly discriminating against black apartment applicants. Trump filed a counterclaim and after nearly two years of fighting, struck a deal with the government. The Justice Department declared it a victory for the enforcement of the Fair Housing Act. Trump also declared victory, in part because the agreement stated that Trump made the deal without acknowledging he was at fault. Throughout the 2016 campaign, Trump drew criticism for painting urban communities as hellishly violent and benighted. “You have so many things, so many problems, so many horrible, horrible problems. The violence. The death. The lack of education. No jobs. We’re going to work with the African American community, and we’re going to solve the problem of the inner city,” Trump told a rally before the election. If confirmed, Carson will join Trump’s Cabinet with a devoted following of conservative Christians, tea party supporters and fans of his achievements in pediatric neurosurgery, which were portrayed in the    film “Gifted Hands. ” “We have much work to do in strengthening every aspect of our nation and ensuring that both our physical infrastructure and our spiritual infrastructure is solid,” Carson wrote Wednesday on Facebook. At the same time, he also brings a lengthy history of gaffes and odd, controversial statements unusual for an incoming Cabinet secretary: He has called President Obama a “psychopath,” compared the Affordable Care Act to slavery and said the contemporary United States is akin to Nazi Germany. In one instance, he said gun control made it possible for the Holocaust to occur. Carson’s unique personal history gives him a pronounced, often controversial view on the roots of urban poverty. [Carson’s positions on poverty create tension with    life story] Born into a struggling family on the southwest side of Detroit, Carson was educated at Yale University and the University of Michigan before he began a celebrated surgical career at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. He credits his achievements to his Christian faith and the high expectations of his mother, an illiterate domestic servant who sought never to take government assistance, though she sometimes did. “She didn’t like the idea of dependency,” Carson told The Washington Post last year. “Even if she sometimes took government aid, she always wanted to be independent. She would get in arguments with others who would say, ‘There’s aid for dependent children  —   you don’t need to be working. ’” Carson’s social and scientific views are also far to the right. According to past statements, including on the 2016 campaign trail, he views being gay as a choice, doubts human activity contributes to global warming and believes abortion should be outlawed in all circumstances, including in cases of rape and incest.

142067,217431,Al Gore just had ‘an extremely interesting conversation’ with Trump on climate change,Washington Post,Jenna Johnson,2016-12-05,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161206001457/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/12/05/ivanka-trump-to-meet-with-al-gore-to-discuss-climate-issues/
","         As Donald Trump continues to indicate that he might be willing to change his position on climate change, which he has long called a “hoax,” the   met Monday with former vice president Al Gore, who has become a prominent activist in the fight against global warming. Gore was originally scheduled to meet just with Trump’s oldest daughter, Ivanka Trump, who is not registered with a political party and has already pushed her father to adopt positions usually promoted by Democrats. Gore told reporters that after that meeting, he then had “an extremely interesting conversation” with the  . “I had a lengthy and very productive session with the  . It was a sincere search for areas of common ground,” Gore told reporters after spending about 90 minutes at Trump Tower in Manhattan during the lunch hour Monday. “I had a meeting beforehand with Ivanka Trump. The bulk of the time was with the   Donald Trump. I found it an extremely interesting conversation, and to be continued, and I’m just going to leave it at that. ” Trump has repeatedly called climate change a “hoax” and has even accused the Chinese government of creating this fake problem to steal manufacturing jobs from the United States. But Trump seemed to soften that position during a meeting with the New York Times late last month, saying that he would keep an “open mind” on the issue and acknowledging that human activity might be connected to changes in the climate.  Ivanka Trump is one of the most influential people in Trump’s life and is a member of his transition team, although she has said she does not plan to take an active role in her father’s administration. Her husband, Jared Kushner, is one of Trump’s most trusted aides, and the couple are reportedly   in Washington. While Gore was not personally close to Hillary Clinton  —   their relationship became strained in the wake of President Bill Clinton’s impeachment and as they both vied for Democratic donors’ support during their respective political bids in 2000  —   the former vice president campaigned on her behalf late in this year’s presidential campaign.  Speaking to an audience at Miami Dade College in October, Gore warned that Trump, “based on the ideas that he has presented, would take us toward a climate catastrophe. ” Appealing directly to millennials, he alluded to his own narrow loss to George W. Bush in 2000 in Florida and said young people could not afford to vote for anyone other than Clinton. “The world is on the cusp of either building on the progress and solving the climate crisis, or stepping back, washing our hands of America’s traditional role as the leader of the world and letting the big polluters call the shots,” Gore said. “The choice is that clear. It’s that stark. ” But while national environmental groups and many scientists have already fired shots across the bow at Donald Trump, suggesting he needs to respect scientific integrity and refrain from appointing advisers who would gut existing environmental and public health safeguards, some prominent activists have been exploring ways to influence the incoming administration. The most obvious target has been Ivanka Trump and her husband, since they are seen as the least conservative members of Trump’s family.  Actor Leonardo DiCaprio, for example, recently gave her a copy of his new National Geographic documentary on climate change, “Before the Flood. ” DiCaprio aired the documentary in October on the White House’s South Lawn, before which he appeared onstage with President Obama and atmospheric scientist Katharine Hayhoe. DiCaprio, who campaigned on Clinton’s behalf and aired the film on college campuses in Florida and elsewhere, did not mention Trump by name but alluded to him at the event. “We must empower leaders who not only believe in climate change but are willing to do something about it,” he said. “The scientific consensus is in, and the argument is now over.

"," The fake news stuff we’ve been talking about? That all just got real. An entire D. C. neighborhood was on lockdown Sunday because some dope with a gun believed a fake news story that wildly and wrongly linked a neighborhood pizzeria to a child sex ring. You could conclude that Edgar Maddison Welch, the    man from North Carolina who allegedly walked into the Comet Ping Pong restaurant carrying an assault rifle, pointed it at an employee and then fired one or more shots, might be a singular nut job.    The exterior of Comet Ping Pong, where a gunman showed up to “ ” a fake story about a child sex ring. (Deb Lindsey   The Washington Post)  He told police he had come to the restaurant to “ ” a false   conspiracy theory that linked Hillary Clinton to the child sex ring. But he wasn’t the only dope who was roped into this. A week before the presidential election, the son of retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn  —   the man   Donald Trump has chosen as his national security adviser  —   shared the Comet Ping Pong conspiracy story. Thousands of others shared it, too. Days later, the retired general himself tweeted a hashtag referring to another fake news story that accused Clinton’s campaign chairman, John Podesta, of satanic rituals using bodily fluids. That there, the satanic ritual stuff, is straight out of the grocery checkout line. Remember when Americans used to laugh at the   supermarket tabloid stories about “Bat Boy!” or “Titanic Survivors Alive!” or “Alien Bible Found! They worship Oprah! ”?     D. C. police detained a gunman on Dec. 4, who had walked into Comet Ping Pong, a popular Northwest Washington restaurant and music venue. Police said no injuries were reported. (Faiz Siddiqui, Bastien   Washington Post)   What was different back then? Why didn’t a desperado come storming toward the White House gates with his gun after the story about George W. Bush meeting with aliens hit the stands? Because most people knew the source of the news  —   the National Enquirer, News of the World, etc.  —   wasn’t remotely serious, as lacking in nutrition as the candy bars the tabloids were displayed alongside. But in today’s social media universe, there’s a flood of stories from fake news sites that look legit. And stories that sound as ludicrous as alien love triangles don’t get a laugh, they get shared by our leaders, generating violent threats, dangerous reactions and, in the worst cases, bloodshed.  In an era when we have more access to more information than ever before, we’ve also become more willing to believe the crazy  —   and share it with others.  What happened at Comet Ping Pong isn’t the first time we’ve seen real consequences of the   phenomenon. A year ago, a gotcha video  —   created by folks who lied, schemed and plotted to get a doctor to talk about the graphic details of her work while secretly being record  —   was pinging in the head of Robert Lewis Dear Jr. when he stormed a Planned Parenthood clinic in Colorado. Dear used the phrase “no more baby parts” after he allegedly killed three people  —   a police officer, an Iraq War veteran and a mother of two  —   and injured nine others in that shooting rampage. Grandstanding congressmen fed him the “baby parts” line after they watched that heavily edited video of a Planned Parenthood executive talking about the donation of tissue from aborted fetuses. (They must’ve forgot that fetal tissue has been used in important medical research since the 1930s and helped produce vaccines for polio, measles and mumps.) The video was created under false pretenses, heavily edited and never would have met the standards of a legitimate news organization. That faux investigation ended in hours of congressional hearings, a budget crisis for Planned Parenthood in many states and the deaths of those three people in Colorado.  Five years ago, it wasn’t fake news but an equally careless use of words that helped incite an equally terrible burst of violence. Supporters of former Alaska governor Sarah Palin put out a map with crosshairs targeting the districts of 20 House Democrats and urging folks: “Don’t Retreat, Instead  —   RELOAD!”  . Gabrielle Giffords ( .) was on that map and criticized it as soon as it was posted online and her office was vandalized. “We’re on Sarah Palin’s targeted list, but the thing is that the way she has it depicted has the crosshairs of a gun sight over our district,” Giffords told MSNBC at the time. “When people do that, they’ve got to realize there’s consequences to that action. ” On Jan. 8, 2011, the consequences were chilling: Jared Loughner showed up with a gun outside a Tucson supermarket where Giffords was greeting constituents and killed six people and injured 20 more, including Giffords.  Still, as the funerals were being held and Giffords was in intensive care, Palin’s supporters insisted crosshairs were never a reference to guns.  Words matter. That kind of disregard for common sense and responsibility has   into what we have today, educated leaders willing to believe conspiracy theories about child sex rings and satanic rituals thanks to nothing more than a   online story. Get a grip, America.  The owner of Comet Ping Pong had endured weeks of death threats. Phone calls, messages, stalkers, employees being harassed. They’ve all complained about the relentless attacks. Then they faced a real attack, which has left a business and a neighborhood deeply shaken.  “Let me state unequivocally: these stories are completely and entirely false, and there is no basis in fact to any of them,” owner James Alefantis wrote on his Comet Ping Pong Facebook page Sunday night. There is no FBI investigation, no New York Police Department takedown. None of that. “What happened today demonstrates that promoting false and reckless conspiracy theories comes with consequences,” Alefantis wrote. “I hope that those involved in fanning these flames will take a moment to contemplate what happened here today, and stop promoting these falsehoods right away. ”  Those who run our social media companies and Internet search engines need to find a way to help a gullible country differentiate between fake news and real news. Let’s make America believe in facts again. Twitter: @petulad   Read more Petula Dvorak:    Winning the championship was ‘breathtaking.’ So is paying for it.    How seriously do D.

142069,217433,Mistrial declared in case of South Carolina officer who shot Walter Scott after traffic stop,Washington Post,Mark Berman,2016-12-05,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161206001457/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2016/12/05/mistrial-declared-in-case-of-south-carolina-officer-who-shot-walter-scott-after-traffic-stop/
","     A jury deadlocked Monday in the case of a former South Carolina police officer charged with murder after he was recorded on video last year firing a barrage of bullets at the back of Walter Scott, a fleeing driver, in one of the most   shootings to rattle the nation in recent years. “We as the jury regret to inform the court that despite the best efforts of all members, we are unable to come to a unanimous decision,” the jury wrote in a note that Circuit Court Judge Clifton Newman read aloud in the courtroom. Newman declared a mistrial shortly before 3:40 p. m. and thanked the jurors for their “hard work in trying to reach a unanimous verdict in this case. ” Prosecutors as well as attorneys for Michael Slager, the former officer, also thanked the jurors for their effort in the case. Several jurors wiped tears from their eyes as Newman made his announcement following more than 20 hours of deliberations. It was the second time in a matter of weeks that a mistrial was declared in a case involving an officer charged with murder after being recorded shooting someone, following a similar outcome in Ohio last month. Prosecutors in South Carolina, echoing their counterparts in Ohio, vowed to seek another trial for Slager. When he declared the mistrial, Newman did not say whether the deadlock came down to a sole holdout. The jury of 11 white people and one black man in Charleston began deliberating Wednesday and seemed on the verge of a deadlock by Friday, when a juror sent a note saying they could not pick a guilty verdict. Jurors then asked to take the weekend off and resume deliberations Monday morning.  Slager, who is white, was fired after graphic video emerged showing him shooting Scott, a black motorist, as the    was running away after a traffic stop in April 2015.      A South Carolina judge on Monday declared a mistrial after a jury deadlocked on whether white former police officer Michael Slager committed murder in the April 2015 shooting death of black motorist Walter Scott. (Reuters)   The recording, captured by a bystander, spread quickly across news stations and the Internet, propelled into the public consciousness during a wave of scrutiny and protests nationwide focusing on how police use deadly force. Slager became the rare officer charged for an   shooting, and the case continued to draw national attention as it stretched into December. Slager, who said he feared for his life during the encounter, was charged remarkably quickly amid a shifting climate sparked by protests in Ferguson, Mo. just months before Scott’s death. After local officials announced the charges and vowed reforms in an attempt to reassure the public, a local activist said they didn’t want the city to become “another Ferguson. ”  After the officer pulled Scott over for a traffic stop, footage recorded by Slager’s dashboard camera captured the two men briefly interacting before Scott runs away and out of view. Over the police radio, Slager can be heard calling in a description of Scott before yelling, “Taser, Taser, Taser!” Far more widely seen was the recording captured by a bystander, video showing Scott fleeing after a physical encounter with Slager. In this video, Scott can be seen running away as the officer takes aim and fires. Slager’s trial effectively put his word against that video footage, contrasting the images shared around the world with an officer’s description of his own fear and what he said happened before the recording began.    Former North Charleston police officer Michael Slager reacts to a question while testifying in the murder trial. (Grace   and Courier via AP)  “I was scared,” Slager said during the trial, holding back tears. He described feeling “total fear that Mr. Scott was coming toward me. ” The video showed Scott’s back to the officer as he fired the fatal shots. Slager said that while he tried to subdue Scott, the driver had grabbed the Taser during a struggle over the device. Speaking on the witness stand, Slager was asked by a prosecutor whether he agreed that Scott was unarmed and running away. He said he did not realize the Taser had dropped behind him when he fired. “At the time,” Slager responded, “I would say no. But after watching the video, yes. ”      Michael Slager, a white, former South Carolina police officer, takes the stand at his murder trial to defend his decision to shoot and kill unarmed black man Walter Scott in April 2015. (Reuters)   In the footage that captured Scott’s death, Slager could be seen placing an item  —   his Taser  —   near Scott’s body after the shooting.  Speaking after the mistrial was declared, Walter Scott’s older brother, Anthony, asked that people who protest in the community remain peaceful. “We’re not going to tear up this city,” he said. “We’re going to keep it just the way it is. We’re going to believe in peaceful protests, because it didn’t turn out the way we feel, but we feel our voices need to be heard. ” Chris Stewart, an attorney for the Scott family, called the trial’s outcome “a missed opportunity for justice” but said the fight was far from over, noting that Slager faces federal charges as well as a retrial. “He may have delayed justice, but he did not escape it,” Stewart said. When asked whether another jury will convict Slager, Stewart responded: “Of course. He dodged it by a hair, and he’s not dodging it again. ”      The lawyers for the family of Walter Scott, the black man who was shot dead by former South Carolina patrolman Michael Slager, reacted on Monday to news of his mistrial, saying the officer has ”delayed” justice but will not ”escape” it. (Reuters)   Scarlett A. Wilson, the prosecutor for Charleston County, said in a statement Monday afternoon that her office fully intended to put Slager on trial once more. “We will try Michael Slager again,” she said. Alluding to the federal charges against Slager, Wilson continued: “We hope the federal and state courts will coordinate efforts regarding any future trial dates but we stand ready whenever the court calls. ”  An attorney for Slager said in an email Monday night that he would spend the coming weeks reviewing the trial’s transcript, examining how to mount a more persuasive argument and “looking for a better way to tell our story. ”   In court, he had thanked the jurors for their efforts. “The rule of law has to be preserved in this country, and you have done that,” Andrew J. Savage III, the attorney, told the jurors. “I thank you. ”  Gov. Nikki Haley said that she understood there will be “a new trial where the Scott family and all of South Carolina will hopefully receive the closure that a verdict brings,” the Associated Press reported. “Justice is not always immediate, but we must all have faith that it will be served I certainly do. ” Officers are infrequently charged for deadly   shootings, and convictions in such cases are even less common. There have been thousands of police shootings since 2005, and during that same span, 78 officers have been charged with murder or manslaughter, according to Philip M. Stinson, a criminologist at Bowling Green State University in Ohio who studies arrests of officers.      The dash cam from North Charleston, S. C. police officer Michael Slager’s vehicle shows the initial traffic stop and interaction that preceded Slager shooting and killing Walter Scott. (South Carolina Law Enforcement Division)   The jury in Slager’s trial began deliberating Wednesday, the same day authorities said a Charlotte police officer would not face charges for fatally shooting a man there in September. Last month, a Minnesota police officer was charged with manslaughter for shooting Philando Castile over the summer, while prosecutors in Ohio said they would retry a former campus police officer in Cincinnati after a mistrial was declared.    An undated photo of Walter Scott. (Family photo via AP)  In all of these cases, video footage  —   some of which captured the shootings, while others captured the aftermath or reactions from loved ones  —   played a key role in the investigations and the public outcries. The recording from Cincinnati, much like the one in North Charleston, appeared to contradict the officer’s account. Slager  —   who also faces a federal civil rights charge for the shooting  —   was charged by the state with murder last year, but the judge agreed last week to let the jurors also consider manslaughter, a lesser charge with a lighter sentence.  Under South Carolina law, murder is defined as killing a person “with malice aforethought, either express or implied” and must be punished with between 30 years in prison or life imprisonment in cases, such as this one, where the death penalty is not being sought. Manslaughter, defined as killing “without malice, express or implied,” carries with it a sentence of between two and 30 years. The jury in Charleston had the choice between these counts or acquitting Slager, if they could reach a unanimous verdict. In Minnesota, prosecutors last month said they opted for a   manslaughter charge for the officer who shot Castile because it was “the highest, most provable offense. ” The prosecutor in Ohio who decided to retry Raymond Tensing, the former officer who shot and killed Samuel DuBose during a traffic stop in Cincinnati last year, said jurors were leaning toward convicting that officer of voluntary manslaughter and acquitting him on the murder charge. He still opted to retry him on both counts. Newman told jurors in Charleston that without a verdict, the case will likely return to the courtroom with another jury. Scott and DuBose were among 991 people fatally shot by police last year, according to a Washington Post database tracking such deaths. Shootings by police were up at the midway point of this year; police are on pace to fatally shoot about the same number of people this year as last year.  In a   study, The Post found that the types of incidents that sparked protests across the country  —   usually white officers killing unarmed black men or boys  —   represented less than 4 percent of fatal shootings. More than 7 in 10 of the people shot were wielding a gun or a knife. More officers have been charged in recent years, which have been roiled by demonstrations and calls for reform. Video evidence, available in an era of widespread police cameras and ubiquitous civilian smartphones, has increasingly been a factor in those cases.    Last year, a makeshift memorial was created where Scott was shot. (David  )  Fewer officers were killed by suspects last year than in 2014, but that number has increased this year, reaching 62 officers shot and killed through the first 11 months of the year  —   up from 38 such deaths last year. Police officers say they are increasingly anxious in the era of smartphones and protests, and after ambush killings of officers in Dallas and Baton Rouge, some in law enforcement call this a uniquely difficult and dangerous time for policing. During his trial, Slager described his regrets from the shooting, saying that in hindsight, he would have called for backup and not chased Scott. The former officer was in custody when his son was born, and while locked up, he was held near Dylann Roof, the    charged with killing nine black parishioners in a Charleston church last year and on trial at the same time as Slager. “My family has been destroyed by this,” Slager said. “The Scott family’s been destroyed by this. It’s horrible. ” Dustin Waters in Charleston, S. C. contributed to this story, which has been updated since first published at 3:42 p. m.

"," I was home with my family Sunday afternoon when an email arrived from a reader with a proposal. He wanted to lynch me. “Rope, Tree, Journalist,” the man wrote. “Some assembly required. ” To this slogan, made popular by   Donald Trump supporters wore at his rallies, my   hangman added his offer: “I will assemble for you. ” This bit of, er, gallows humor was the latest, though far from the worst, of the sort of correspondence my colleagues and I have been receiving lately. There was a time when threats against journalists, like threats of any sort of political violence, were exceedingly rare. But in Trump’s America, such threats are neither rare nor idle. If you doubt that, consider the events in recent days at Comet Ping Pong, the family pizza place in Northwest Washington I’ve been frequenting with my daughter ever since she was a toddler a decade ago. Lately, the owner and staff at Comet  —   and those of other businesses on the block  —   have been getting death threats, spurred by radio host Alex Jones, a conspiracy theorist with close ties to the  .     Comet Ping Pong customers came out to support the restaurant after a gunman entered it with an assault rifle, firing it at least once. Several other businesses on the block have received other threats as well. (Whitney   Washington Post)   Jones has been whipping up a bogus and bizarre accusation that Comet is a front for a Hillary   pedophilia ring, and the resulting calls and messages threaten a “public lynching” of this nonexistent ring. “I pray someone comes to Comet pizza with automatic weapons and kills everyone inside,” wrote one. “I just may cut your throat. . . . I truly hope someone blows your brains all over Comet pizza. ” Comet’s owners asked the FBI for help but heard nothing in reply from James Comey’s agents. They heard instead from a North Carolina man, carrying an assault rifle, who walked into Comet and started shooting on Sunday afternoon  —   by coincidence, about the same time I got the email from the aspiring hangman. The man told police he had come to “ ” the pedophilia conspiracy. Mercifully, nobody was hurt. The notion that Clinton and her aides are involved in pedophilia has been furthered by none other than Michael Flynn, the man Trump tapped to be his national security adviser. On Nov. 2, Flynn tweeted about allegations that Clinton emails included evidence of “sex crimes with children. ” Even after the man fired his assault weapon inside Comet on Sunday afternoon, Flynn’s son, Michael Flynn Jr. spread further suspicion on Twitter about Comet and the Clinton pedophilia ring. This would appear to be the new normal: Not only disagreeing with your opponent but accusing her of running a pedophilia ring, provoking such fury that somebody takes it upon himself to start shooting. Not only chafing when criticized in the press but stoking   hysteria that leads some supporters to threaten to kill journalists. After The Washington Post reported Sunday about the Comet gunman and the nonsense conspiracy theory that motivated him, the reporters received emails and tweets saying “I hope the next shooter targets you lying sacks of     in the media,” “God has a plan better than death,” and “it would also be a shame if someone took a gun to” The Post. Trump is not directly responsible for every violent word or action of his followers. But he foments violence. As The Post’s executive editor, Marty Baron, has noted, when Trump refers to journalists as “the lowest form of life,” “scum” and the enemy, “it is no wonder that some members of our staff [at The Post] and at other news organizations received vile insults and threats of personal harm so worrisome that extra security was required. ” Trump, during the campaign, fantasized about Clinton and her judicial nominees being assassinated. He boasted that “I bring rage out” in people, and his violent rallies proved it. Since the election, Trump has falsely accused the media of inciting violence. At his speech in Ohio last week he denounced the “dishonest” media no fewer than six times. He has also been encouraging Jones, leading publicist of the    absurdity. Trump has praised Jones’s “amazing” reputation, called Jones after winning the presidency to thank him for his support, and has regularly parroted Jones’s conspiracy ideas. Now we are beginning to see the consequences of the rage and paranoia Trump has encouraged: A disturbed man fires an assault weapon in a place where tots play  . The only “crime” of the owner, James Alefantis, was to be a Clinton supporter who had, the WikiLeaks hack exposed, discussed with Clinton aide John Podesta the possibility of hosting a Clinton fundraiser. If Trump were a different leader, he would declare that political violence is unacceptable in a free society. Perhaps he’d say it after eating a “Steel Wills” pie at Comet. But instead he continues to fuel rage against his opponents and his critics. More and worse violence will inevitably follow.

142071,217435,Fidel Castro and communism’s flawed record with black people,Washington Post,Terrell Jermaine Starr,2016-12-05,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161206001457/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/global-opinions/wp/2016/12/05/fidel-castro-and-communisms-flawed-record-with-black-people/
","     Terrell Jermaine Starr is a freelance journalist in New York City who specializes in  . S. affairs and national security. You can follow him on Twitter: @Russian_Starr.  In 1930, Robert Robinson left his job at Ford Motor Company in Detroit to work as an engineer in Soviet Moscow. Robinson, who was born in Jamaica and grew up in Cuba, had hoped to avoid the racism he faced in the United States. He was immediately disappointed. Soviet citizens regularly hurled racial slurs at him and he was routinely denied promotions at his factory job because of his racist Russian supervisors. In his autobiography Black on Red: My 44 Years Inside the Soviet Union, Robinson said the Soviets used his achievements as political tools to ridicule America on its racial issues. In reality, the Soviet Union had racial issues of its own. He fled the U. S. S. R. in 1974. And Cuba really isn’t any better, even after Fidel Castro’s revolution. Be it the U. S. S. R. or Cuba, communism, as a political system, is not the oasis of racial harmony most black Americans believe it to be. As a Fulbright Scholar who has studied how black peoples from America, Africa and the Caribbean experienced communist states, I can tell you that for every Assata Shakur who finds safe haven in Cuba, there are jails full of “  Cubans” who have never received the dignity of their American exile guest. And for every Langston Hughes who was treated like royalty in Moscow, there are people such as Pierre Kalmek, a sailor from Francophile Africa, who lived in the Moscow during the early 1930s and complained that locals regularly spat on him. Over the past week, Castro was lionized for his   activities across Africa and his embrace of black civil rights figures in the United States. After Angela Davis was acquitted of murder, in 1972, she visited Cuba to thank its people for supporting her during her murder trial. And when Black Panther Party members Eldridge Cleaver and Huey Newton needed refuge, Castro opened the doors of Havana to them. But in Communist Cuba, all black lives do not matter. One of the first mistakes Castro made when he took power in 1959 was to determine that racism was solved in Cuba. Like Castro, Soviet officials made similar   declarations that allowed even more racism to fester. In Cuba, 62 percent of the population is black, but 71 percent of its public leadership is white, according to a 2009 study. What’s even more disturbing: In 2009, 70 percent of black Cubans were unemployed; 60 percent of black Cubans cited racial discrimination as the cause. Roberto Zurbana, editor and publisher of the Casa de las Américas publishing house, wrote in the New York Times that, because Cuba inherited more than three hundred centuries of slavery from colonial rule, Afro Cubans haven’t been able to take advantage of the nation’s economic liberalization after the 1959 revolution.  “Most remittances from abroad  —   mainly the Miami area, the nerve center of the mostly white exile community  —   go to white Cubans,” Zubana wrote. “They tend to live in more upscale houses, which can easily be converted into restaurants or     —   the most common kind of private business in Cuba. Black Cubans have less property and money, and also have to contend with pervasive racism. Not long ago it was common for hotel managers, for example, to hire only white staff members, so as not to offend the supposed sensibilities of their European clientele. ” For speaking out, Zurbana was rewarded with losing his post. How, then, could Castro, a revolutionary who supported freedom fighters in Africa and America, allow racism this pervasive to rule in his own country? Because the Cuban revolution could not overcome its whiteness, that’s why. The same holds true for the U. S. S. R. The Russians who dominated the Communist Party could not overcome their  . That is how racism continued to rule its nation during the Soviet period  —   and racial strife isn’t any better for black people in Russia after 1991, either. Kimberly R. Lyle, a black American of Cuban descent, wrote in Fusion that one of her uncles, a chemist, was left homeless after he requested permission to leave the country and her cousin expressed anger that he had to flee Cuba to be, in her words, “a free man. ” “Does it matter to   that the penalties for speaking out against the Cuban government are beatings and the threat of rape or death?” she asked. “Are we concerned that black Cubans are incarcerated at higher rates than white Cubans? Do we care that black Cubans still can’t enter many hotels or restaurants? Does it matter to us that Castro could not liberate black people in his own country? This, too, is Castro’s legacy. ” That is the legacy of how communism works in nations that have a black minority population. In the end, it ends up failing the same people its propaganda claims to support. As black people, we understandably are in a constant exploration for a political system that liberates us. Unfortunately, communism, like Western democracy, ultimately ended up failing us in the cases of Cuba and the U. S. S. R. If you are a black person whose fame scores political points, you will be treated accordingly. But, for average black peoples who do not carry such political pull, you are subject to the same ills as black people in the capitalist nations that communism has historically abhorred. We thank Castro for protecting Assata Shakur and we thank the U. S. S. R. for rolling out the red carpet for Langston Hughes and other exceptional black Americans. But we cannot naively lionize Castro as a true freedom fighter when most of the black people who called him their leader suffer behind prison bars and live below poverty lines his revolution failed to address."

","         We’ve never had a president whose business created as many potential conflicts of interest as Donald Trump, and at the same time we’ve never had a president who cared less about conflicts of interest as Donald Trump. Indeed, he and his children are making it quite clear that they will use the presidency as a tool to make as much money as they can.  And Republicans, particularly members of Congress, have apparently decided that if Trump does it, it’s okay.  There was a time when they worried that being too closely associated with him would taint them in the eyes of voters. Now they’ve been utterly corrupted by that association, before he even takes office. Darren Samuelsohn has a good look at what’s happening: Indeed, the GOP is so easily dismissing Democratic threats of investigations and ethicists’ calls for divestment out of a belief that the political landscape has shifted. Voters rewarded Trump in part on the idea that success in business will equal success in government, and Republicans are therefore unwilling to encourage the   to put distance between the Oval Office and Trump Tower, or between himself and the children who serve him as trusted advisers. “This is a great test case between the   and   worlds,” said former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, a prominent early GOP backer of the  . “In a   world dominated by   ideas, anyone successful is inherently dangerous and should be punished for trying to serve the country. ” “The American people,” Gingrich added, “knowingly voted for a businessman whose name is inextricably tied to his fortune.   …     I’d say to the left wing, get over it. ” Trump obviously feels the same way. Last week he tweeted, “Prior to the election it was well known that I have interests in properties all over the world. Only the crooked media makes this a big deal!”  Meanwhile he and his children are barely trying to hide their eagerness to cash in on the presidency. Wondering why Ivanka Trump sat in on the meeting her father had with the Japanese prime minister shortly after the election? “Ms. Trump is nearing a licensing deal with the Japanese apparel giant Sanei International,” the New York Times reports. “The largest shareholder of Sanei’s parent company is the Development Bank of Japan, which is wholly owned by the Japanese government. ” Ivanka, whose husband has emerged as Trump’s closest adviser, will be moving to Washington to better coordinate their activities. Perhaps it seems silly to say, “Imagine what Republicans would be saying if this was Hillary Clinton,” but the comparison highlights how malleable their principles are. They were (or at least pretended to be) horrified at the thought that as Secretary of State, Clinton might have a meeting with a foreign dignitary whose government made a donation to the Clinton Foundation to support the distribution of AIDS medications in Africa. But foreign interests basically depositing money into Donald Trump’s bank account? What’s the big deal?  Just before the election, Jason Chaffetz, who heads the House government oversight committee, was forthright about the fact that if Clinton won he’d be issuing subpoenas every time she brushed her teeth. But now he has taken a very different attitude toward his committee’s watchdog role. “It’s sort of ridiculous to go after [Trump] when his financial disclosure is already online,” Chaffetz now says.  We’re going to see this again and again: not just a disinterest in Trump’s copious conflicts of interest, but a willingness to parrot whatever ludicrous defense Trump makes of them. If some dictator somewhere wants to slap Trump’s name on a hotel and pay the Trump Organization $20 million in exchange, isn’t that just proof of what a great businessman Trump is? And why would anyone think that might affect U. S. foreign policy, when Trump’s kids are running the business? It’s not like they’re advising him on government policy and personnel. Oh, wait, that’s exactly what they’re doing.  And while Republicans used to defend Trump’s refusal to release his tax returns on the bogus grounds that he was being audited by the IRS, you can bet that when the question comes up in the future, they’ll say that it’s just silly to ask the president to release his returns at all.  You can say that this is just standard partisanship, and the president’s party is always going to defend him. But what’s different about this moment is how blatant and unapologetic the incoming president is being about continuing to pursue his business interests. This is a reminder that the institutions we rely on to keep the government honest are dependent upon the integrity of the people within them. One has to ask: What would it take for Republicans in Congress to take the conflict of interest issue seriously? Would you have to have Trump on video being handed a briefcase full of cash and saying, “In exchange for this bribe, I will alter American policy to help you, Mr. Dictator”? Anything short of that, they’ll find a way to deny and dismiss.  During the campaign, there were times when Republicans would criticize something Trump had done or said, like his bigoted attacks on the judge in his fraud case or his bragging about committing sexual assault. They’d do it carefully, continuing to support him while criticizing the content of the statement he had made. But now that he’s president they won’t even go that far. There is almost nothing he could do that they wouldn’t defend. When you have divided government, the administration knows that both the Congress and the media are watching it, which restrains its behavior. But we’re in the process of creating an environment where everyone knows that accountability is a joke. Almost a year ago, Trump said, “I could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody, and I wouldn’t lose any voters, okay?” Now he knows that he could stand in the middle of Pennsylvania Avenue and shoot somebody, and Republicans in Congress would say that it’s ridiculous for anyone to think he had done anything wrong.

142073,217437,How to treat Trump’s nominees,Washington Post,Jennifer Rubin,2016-12-05,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161206001457/https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2016/12/05/how-to-treat-trumps-nominees/
","         We find it predictable that Democrats should seek “payback” for the GOP Senate’s refusal to hold confirmation hearings on Merrick Garland to fill the seat vacated by Antonin Scalia’s untimely death. We learn: “Multiple Democratic senators told Politico in interviews last week that after watching Republicans sit on Merrick Garland’s nomination to the Supreme Court for nearly a year, they’re in no mood to   Trump’s selections. ” As a matter of good politics and good governance, we would suggest that the Senate Democrats separate the nominees into three categories. They may disagree about which nominees go in which categories, but the methodology will be useful.  First are those nominees who are qualified, temperamentally sound and within the political mainstream. The most obvious example would be Elaine Chao (former labor secretary and former deputy transportation secretary) for transportation secretary. While Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand ( . Y.) has raised concerns about putting a retired general in the defense secretary spot (a congressional   would be needed) Senate Democrats  —   and the rest of the country  —   should thank their lucky stars that Gen. James Mattis, a big thinker, brilliant strategist, cautious and deliberate leader and   international figure, has been picked. Nixing him would risk getting a far worse nominee. (The longer the secretary of defense post remains open, the longer retired Lt. Mike Flynn will remain unchallenged and unchecked.) These nominees should get a serious but brisk hearing, and barring any surprise, receive prompt nomination. Democrats may not agree with their views, but Rep. Tom Price ( .) for the Department of Health and Human Services and Rep. Mike Pompeo ( .) for CIA also fall into this category as well. In the second category are those nominees who have no direct government experience but have relevant qualifications or experience outside the purview of the post to which they have been nominated. We don’t know their views on a range of issues and don’t know whether they possess the requisite knowledge and skills. They very well could have immersed themselves in the subject matter. They could bring a fresh perspective to the job, but they require a greater degree of scrutiny. A more thorough examination is required for nominees such as Steve Mnuchin, Wilbur Ross, Todd Ricketts, Nikki Haley and Betsy DeVos. Again, some of these may be among the best of Trump’s picks, but they are unknown quantities; the Senate is obligated to give them a thorough examination. In particular, some were major donors during the election. The Senate is obligated to determine whether there was any quid pro quo and how these individuals intend to deal with conflicts of interest. The third category is for nominees who are patently unqualified, infamous for extreme   bizarre public pronouncements, lug around enough ethical baggage to fill a 747 or stand outside the mainstream of GOP thought. (Some may have a single demerit, others a lot of them.) Ben Carson surely falls into this category. He has never held any public office, openly disparaged housing desegregation policies and reportedly declined the top HHS post (arguably closer to his area of expertise) because “his background didn’t prepare him to run a federal agency. ” Should Trump nominate someone like Rudy Giuliani or Russia apologist Rep. Dana Rohrabacher ( .) the secretary of state nominee would fall into this category. And yes, given his past statements and extreme views on immigration, many Democrats would put Sen. Jeff Sessions ( .) into this group. For nominees in the third batch, Democrats should insist on exacting, extended testimony. They should force someone like Rohrabacher to defend his cheerleading for Vladimir Putin  —   and in essence, dare Republicans to defend him. Carson should be asked about specific policies and his understanding of issues he will need to grapple with. This should not be a trivia contest, but if he does not know the basics of federal housing policy, he has no business getting the job. Sessions needs to explain some of his past statements (he claims to have been taken out of context) and his case for repeal of birthright citizenship and mass deportation. He needs to be grilled about the degree to which the Justice Department will alter legal analysis on executive power to support the president and what Sessions would be prepared to do if Trump insisted on ordering the military to commit war crimes. In some cases, Republicans seem prepared to stick by the nominee (e. g. Sessions) no matter what; Democrats’ role in these cases will be to inform the public about his views, compel Republicans to “own” the nominee and demarcate the areas of oversight they will be pursuing if he gets confirmed. In other cases, Democrats may be successful in shaming a few Republicans into opposing a nominee, thereby blocking one of the worst picks. In short, Democrats should exercise discretion in how they treat nominees. They will be more credible and successful if they don’t treat Tom Price like Ben Carson. They won’t win many of the fights, but where necessary, they will do the public a service by exposing what Trump and his nominees are all about and just how much the Republicans are willing to put up with for the sake of party loyalty. Sometimes shaming the other side is all one can expect  —   but nevertheless is an important exercise."
142074,217438,A lot of people in red states are set to lose Obamacare,Washington Post,Greg Sargent,2016-12-05,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161206001457/https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2016/12/05/a-lot-of-people-in-red-states-are-set-to-lose-obamacare/
","         As Republicans barrel headlong towards repealing the Affordable Care Act, new factoids and data are slowly dribbling out to reveal just what a mess they are about to make, including for countless numbers of their own constituents. The latest: The Kaiser Family Foundation today released a new study breaking down how many people in each state are benefiting from the ACA’s subsidies to buy health insurance on the individual market  —   and how much money people in each state are getting. We’re talking about a lot of people in red states and in states with Republican legislators  —   and a lot of money. The full breakdown, which is based on state data, is right here. The overall conclusion is that more than nine million people across the country are currently receiving subsidies, and many of them are likely to be people who might not be able to afford insurance otherwise. All of those subsidies would be repealed if the GOP rolls back the health law, as expected. Here are a few takeaways from the numbers: * In red states, a total of at least 3 million people are currently getting subsidies. This doesn’t include the swing states that Donald Trump won. If you add those in, that swells the total to over six million people. * Some of the states with the highest populations of people getting subsidies are represented by GOP Senators. This includes Florida (more than 1. 4 million); Texas (more than 913, 000); North Carolina (more than 499, 000); Georgia (more than 427, 000); and Pennsylvania (more than 321, 000). Many other states with GOP senators also have sizable populations getting subsidies. Keep in mind, this doesn’t even include the Medicaid expansion. By my calculations, more than 20 GOP senators represent states that have expanded Medicaid. (The ones that have expanded Medicaid and have one or two GOP Senators are Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Montana, Nevada, North Dakota, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia.) Many of those are red states. Now, in fairness, Republicans keep insisting they are going to replace the ACA in ways that minimize the disruptions for all these people. And it’s true that some of the GOP replace plans  —   such as the one offered by Trump’s pick for health and human services secretary, GOP Rep. Tom Price  —   offer their own subsidy schemes. But those plans tend to use criteria different from income level to determine eligibility for subsidies, and there is little indication that anywhere near as many people would get them. Republicans have also talked about keeping some form of the Medicaid expansion money while   control to the states. But it’s unclear whether Republicans can unite behind any replace plan including all of these things in any case. Right now, Republicans appear to be coalescing behind a strategy that would repeal the ACA but delay repeal’s implementation for a few years, to give Republicans time to work out a consensus replacement. But given that so many people might be left without coverage if they don’t, the question becomes: How many Republicans will vote for repeal if no replace plan has been determined yet? One GOP Senator, Susan Collins of Maine, is now saying she may not support repeal unless there is some replacement ready to go. There is no telling what she will actually do in the end. But it’s possible that this could indicate other GOP senators may grow increasingly uncomfortable with supporting     . There are other problems with this strategy, too. With no certainty about what’s next, insurers might exit the market. Alternatively, if Republicans do keep the ban on discrimination against people with preexisting conditions (as they say they want to do; after all, it’s popular) while repealing the individual mandate, that could make the insurance pool a lot sicker and lead to a dreaded “death spiral. ” Meanwhile, conservative writer Philip Klein asks a good question: Why would it be any easier for Republicans to pass a replace plan heading into the next presidential election? If anything, it would probably be harder. The thinking among Republicans seems to be that, with a deadline looming for millions to lose health coverage, Democrats can be pressured into helping support a replace plan that is much more in keeping with GOP priorities, which is to say, it will spend and regulate far less, and cover far fewer people (while allowing them to say they have health care solutions). But as Brian Beutler notes, if anything, Democrats might be able to use this to leverage Republicans. After all, a sizable block of conservative Republicans may be resistant to passing anything that spends a lot of money to cover people. If so, Republicans would only be able to pass something with the help of a sizable chunk of Democrats, which could presumably give them a way to pressure into Republicans for a plan that’s somewhat more to Democrats’ liking. Of course, for all these reasons, it’s possible no replacement will ever materialize. Republicans might be fine with that outcome. I used to think that Republicans might pay a big price for yanking coverage out from under millions. I’m no longer sure. But if no replacement does materialize, it is true that we will be looking at a very big mess, heading right into the 2020 elections  —   including in a lot of red and swing states  —   and there’s no telling how that will play.

"," Relax. Breathe. Donald Trump’s phone call with the president of Taiwan wasn’t a blunder by an inexperienced   unschooled in the niceties of   diplomacy. It was a deliberate move  —   and a brilliant one at that. The phone call with President Tsai   was reportedly carefully planned, and Trump was fully briefed before the call, according to The Post. It’s not that Trump was unfamiliar with the “Three Communiques” or unaware of the fiction that there is “One China. ” Trump knew precisely what he was doing in taking the call. He was serving notice on Beijing that it is dealing with a different kind of president  —   an outsider who will not be encumbered by the same Lilliputian diplomatic threads that tied down previous administrations. The message, as John Bolton correctly put it, was that “the president of the United States [will] talk to whomever he wants if he thinks it’s in the interest of the United States, and nobody in Beijing gets to dictate who we talk to. ”      The Washington Post’s Jia Lynn Yang explains the back story on relations between the U. S. China and Taiwan and the ramifications of Friday’s telephone call between   Donald Trump and Taiwanese President Tsai  . (Alice Li, Victoria   Washington Post)    Amen to that. And if that message was lost on Beijing, Trump underscored it on Sunday, tweeting: “Did China ask us if it was OK to devalue their currency (making it hard for our companies to compete) heavily tax our products going into their country (the U. S. doesn’t tax them) or to build a massive military complex in the middle of the South China Sea? I don’t think so!” He does not need Beijing’s permission to speak to anyone. No more kowtowing in a Trump administration. Trump promised during the campaign that he would take a tougher stand with China, and supporting Taiwan has always been part of his   approach to Beijing. As far back as 2011, Trump tweeted: “Why is @BarackObama delaying the sale of   aircraft to Taiwan? Wrong message to send to China. #TimeToGetTough. ” Indeed, the very idea that Trump could not speak to Taiwan’s president because it would anger Beijing is precisely the kind of   subservience that Trump promised to eliminate as president.  Trump’s call with the Taiwanese president sent a message not only to Beijing, but also to the     establishment in Washington. It is telling how so many in that establishment immediately assumed Trump had committed an unintended gaffe. “Bottomless  ” is how one liberal   commentator described Trump’s decision to speak with Tsai. Trump just shocked the world by winning the presidential election, yet they still underestimate him. The irony is that the hyperventilation in Washington has far outpaced the measured response from Beijing. When American   elites are more upset than China, perhaps it’s time for some introspection.  The hypocrisy is rank. When President Obama broke with decades of U. S. policy and extended diplomatic recognition to a murderous dictatorship in Cuba, the   establishment swooned. Democrats on Capitol Hill praised Obama for taking action that was “long overdue. ” Former President Jimmy Carter raved about how Obama had “shown such wisdom,” while the New York Times gushed that Obama was acting “courageously” and “ushering in a transformational era for millions of Cubans who have suffered as a result of more than 50 years of hostility between the two nations. ”             Caption   Trump has been holding interviews and meetings as he prepares to transition into the White House.

","  NEW DELHI  —   As a new American president bent on retaining American jobs prepares to take office, the Obama administration and the U. S. defense industry are working on a deal with the Indian government to build iconic U. S. combat aircraft in India. In recent months, Lockheed Martin and Boeing have made proposals to the Indian government to manufacture fighter jets  —   the   Fighting Falcon and the    Super Hornet  —   in India as the country seeks to modernize its rapidly aging fleet of largely   airplanes. In both cases, the aviation companies would be building production facilities in India; Lockheed Martin proposes to move its entire   assembly line from Texas to India, making India the sole producer of the   combat aircraft. The U. S. military is phasing out the   for its own use, but other countries remain as likely customers. The proposals have the strong backing of the Obama administration, which has sought a closer connection with the Indian military in recent years. Air Force Secretary Deborah Lee James said she was “optimistic” about the prospect of a deal after a visit to New Delhi in August, and Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter is set to return to India this week, with procurement high atop the list of discussion topics.       Donald Trump said that his administration will crack down on what he referred to as ”foreign trade abuses” during a rally in Cincinnati on Thursday. (Victoria   Washington Post)   But the election of a billionaire businessman focused on keeping jobs at home, rather than creating them overseas, has brought a measure of uncertainty to the talks. “What will be the U. S. policy posture now that the new   is in the mix?” said one   official at an American defense firm in India, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal negotiations. “Is he going to continue the policy of engaging in India on   and  ? All of those are unknown at this point. ”  On Thursday,   Donald Trump appeared at a Carrier plant in Indiana, where his team had brokered a deal to save about 1, 000 jobs, and on Sunday he let fire a series of tweets that implied a new tax penalty on goods produced by companies that leave the United States.  “Please be forewarned prior to making a very expensive mistake! THE UNITED STATES IS OPEN FOR BUSINESS,” he tweeted.  On the campaign trail he railed against job losses to Asia and Mexico. “We are living through the greatest jobs theft in the world,” Trump said last month, citing American companies that have laid off workers and moved jobs to India, Singapore and Mexico. “It’s getting worse and worse and worse. ” Officials at Lockheed Martin and Boeing said that any partnership to manufacture jets in India would not result in a net loss of American jobs but would create Indian employment  —   about 1, 000 positions in the case of Lockheed Martin.     China’s state media brushed off controversy over   Donald Trump’s phone call with Taiwan’s leader, but some investors are concerned about the break with diplomatic protocol. (Reuters)   About 300 mechanics on the Fort Worth assembly line would be moved to the   assembly line at the same plant. Others would be given an opportunity to apply for other jobs on the newer   Lockheed officials said, although they concede that some positions would be lost in the move because of attrition or retirements. “I see this as a great opportunity for all parties involved,” said Randy Howard, director of business development for Lockheed’s integrated fighter group. “It doesn’t take jobs away from the U. S. it extends existing jobs, and not just for Fort Worth but for many other companies around the U. S. that build parts for the  . ” Nevertheless, workers in Fort Worth say they are worried about the future. “Wouldn’t you be?” said Earnest Boone, president of the District Lodge 776, International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, which represents Lockheed employees. In October, the Indian government sent a letter to foreign missions and aerospace manufacturers inquiring about   fighter aircraft that could be manufactured locally. India wants to   the fighter jets as part of its Make in India program, which has the lofty goal of expanding the manufacturing base to 25 percent of the gross domestic product in the next six years. Nitin Wakankar, a spokesman for India’s Ministry of Defense, said that the process of selecting the new jet “has not started yet,” so answering detailed questions would be premature. India’s costly earlier effort to partner with the French company Dassault Aviation for 126 jets unraveled, and the government ended up buying only 36   Rafale planes this year. Analysts say Lockheed’s main rival in the   sphere is Sweden’s Saab Group and its Gripen fighter.   Boeing also has proposed to make its twin engine    in India. Boeing recently took a group of Indian defense journalists on a whirlwind tour of Australia and the United States to show off its program. The U. S. Air Force is phasing out the   in favor of the   aircraft in coming years and the company has no orders for the   beyond October 2017, but it is seeking other customers and does not plan to dismantle the assembly line just yet. The   airplane remains one of the most widely used aircraft in the world, and Lockheed is continuing to negotiate deals to sell the fighter to other countries. Those   would be made in India under the deal once the new assembly line was up and running, Howard said. The aircraft has been made in joint ventures with other nations before, but “we’ve never offered our only production line to another country,” Howard said. “It’s unprecedented. ” Lockheed has promised that India would not only manufacture and export its jets, but it also would play a “critical role” in supporting a fleet of about 3, 200   in operation around the world, said Jon Grevatt, an Asia Pacific defense industry analyst with IHS Jane’s, a defense analysis firm. “That’s a big carrot,” he noted. A potential stumbling block to the deal is the willingness of the U. S. government to part with enough of its mission system technology to make the package palatable to the Indians. The aircraft is viewed negatively by some in the defense establishment here as a dated platform that first rolled off the assembly line in 1978  —   despite its current     avionics. Another strike against it, for some, is that it is the fighter aircraft used by archrival Pakistan. “The   is a good aircraft, it has lived its life, but its time is over,” said Muthumanickam Matheswaran, a retired Indian air force air marshal and analyst. A greater concern, said Pushan Das, a fellow at the Observer Research Foundation in Delhi, is whether “India wants to be seen as close to the United States and building U. S. fighter aircraft, or does it want to be more politically neutral and choose a partner like Sweden, given the fact that New Delhi needs to manage its relationship with Russia and China. That’s the main thing. ” India’s defense procurement typically moves at a glacial pace. Ashley J. Tellis, a scholar for the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, wrote in a March paper that the Indian air force is in “crisis” and that its troubled acquisition and development programs threaten its air superiority over rapidly modernizing rivals Pakistan and China. The country hopes to expand its fleet from 36. 5 squadrons to as many as 45 squadrons by 2027  —   an unlikely prospect, the study found, because of budget constraints, slow procurement and other limitations.

142077,217441,"Ahead of Trump White House, Obama administration releases memo outlining use of force rules",Washington Post,Karen DeYoung,2016-12-05,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161206001457/https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/ahead-of-trump-white-house-obama-administration-releases-memo-outlining-use-of-force-rules/2016/12/05/5b234e3a-bb0f-11e6-94ac-3d324840106c_story.html
"," On the eve of a new administration that has promised more aggressive counterterrorism operations, the Obama White House has released a lengthy compendium of its own policies governing the use of force. The   document outlines eight years of the administration’s legal opinions, executive orders and military directives. In a strong defense of the administration’s actions, it lists rules for lethal drones and terrorist detention, and describes the international and domestic law that undergirds them. Such rules are important to reduce “the risk of an   decision,” President Obama wrote in an introduction to the document. When making policy on war and peace, he wrote, it was critical to disclose “as much information as possible to the public . . . so that an informed public can scrutinize our actions and hold us to account. ” Obama said that, together with the report, he was issuing a presidential memorandum “that encourages future Administrations to build on this report and carry forward the principles of transparency it represents. ” The memorandum, he said, asks for it to be updated by the National Security Council staff at least on an annual basis and released to the public. There is no statutory requirement for the document, titled “Report on the Legal and Policy Frameworks Guiding the United States’ Use of Military Force and Related National Security Operations,” and no obligation to make it public. A senior administration official said that the White   report had “been in the works” since before the election and is not targeted at the incoming Trump administration, which will be led by a president who has spoken approvingly of using torture.  “Putting it together and presenting it to the next administration, it would be a helpful guidebook, certainly,” said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity in advance of the official release. “But it wouldn’t have the same import as informing the American public. ” Although some of the procedures the report outlines are based on court decisions and legislation, many come from executive orders that the next president is free to amend or override. For instance, the rules on the use of interrogation techniques, such as waterboarding and other methods that have been deemed torture, are a combination of legal interpretations and legislation as well as military and presidential directives. Obama said repeatedly this year that he wanted to “institutionalize” the policies that have governed his administration’s use of force, in hopes that they would serve future administrations and better position the public to judge the actions of its government.  While the document contains no new information, “it’s the first time it’s all been in the same place, that it’s put together in such a way that it will be a guidebook for what we have employed . . . and how we have justified our use of force,” said the official, who called it a “  shop. ” During his campaign, Donald Trump said of waterboarding that “nobody knows if it’s torture,” and that “enhanced interrogation . . . works. ” Speaking of the Islamic State, he said, “We have to play the game the way they’re playing the game. You’re not going to win if we’re soft and they’re, they have no rules. ”  The U. S. ban on waterboarding, he said early this year, was a sign of weakness. “I think we’ve become very weak and ineffective,” he said. The Islamic State “must think we are a little bit on the weak side. ” Following strong criticism of those views, including his willingness to target family members of terrorists, Trump appeared to reverse himself somewhat and said that he understood “that the United States is bound by laws and treaties. ”  “I will not order a military officer to disobey the law. It is clear that as president I will be bound by laws just like all Americans and I will meet those responsibilities. ” Last month, in comments on his meetings with retired Marine Gen. James N. Mattis, subsequently selected as his nominee for defense secretary, Trump said he was “surprised” when Mattis told him he had “never found [torture] to be useful. ”  “I was surprised, because he’s known as being like the toughest guy,” Trump said in an interview with the New York Times. “And when he said that, I’m not saying it changed my mind. Look, we have people that are chopping off heads and drowning people in steel cases and we’re not allowed to waterboard. ” But, he said, “if it’s so important to the American people, I would go for” torture. Trump has said he plans a more aggressive strategy against the Islamic State and other terrorist groups, but he has provided no specifics. Although he disparaged the abilities of the U. S. military and its leadership at various times, he has also said that he will give his “generals” 30 days to come up with a new strategy for him to consider. While his choice of a secretary of state is still awaited, Mattis’s selection to head the Defense Department has met with widespread approval and strong indications that he will have no trouble being confirmed. Trump has also said he plans to nominate Rep. Mike Pompeo ( .) a member of the House Intelligence Committee, as director of the CIA and Sen. Jeff Sessions ( .) as attorney general.  The White House document released Monday is organized into sections covering the legal bases for its actions, including the 2001 Authorization for the Use of Military Force, the president’s constitutional powers to defend the nation without first seeking congressional authorization, the Geneva Conventions and other aspects of international law covering  . Revisiting past announcements and releases, the report outlines how those rules have been applied in each theater in which they have been used, including Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Somalia, Libya and Yemen  —   all of which, except Somalia, have been designated “areas of active hostilities” covered by the international laws of war. The designation exempts such areas from rules that the administration laid out in 2013 for targeted killings outside war zones. Adding to previously released documents, the report details the most recent designation of Libya as an “area of active hostilities,” based on a request from the Libyan government to help dislodge Islamic   militants in the city of Sirte. Since then, more than 400 airstrikes have been carried out there. The Obama administration maintains that the Islamic State, as an offshoot of the   group in Iraq, is covered under the 2001 authorization allowing the use of military force against those who planned and carried out the   attacks against the United States this year. Obama has unsuccessfully requested that Congress pass a new authorization specifically directed at the Islamic State. The new report also mentions a recent decision to place Somalia’s   group in the list of   “associated forces” for purposes of targeting under the 2001 authorization. Other portions of the report cover rules for the targeting, capture, detention, prosecution and transfer of individuals in an armed conflict.  It notes that previously released guidance on lengthy procedures to determine whether an individual or group is eligible for lethal targeting, and a “near certainty” that civilians will not be killed. The document also restates a preference for captures over kills, and revisits legal decisions governing the rules for targeting U. S. citizens abroad. Although Obama is unlikely to achieve his goal of closing the U. S. detention center at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, the report notes that the number of prisoners there has been reduced from 242 to 59 under his administration. Trump has said he plans to keep Guantanamo open.

Pat McCrory (R) concedes closely contested governor’s race,Washington Post,Amber Phillips,2016-12-05,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161206001457/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/12/05/north-carolina-gov-pat-mccrory-r-concedes-closely-contested-governors-race/
","It’s official: The last  —   and most heated  —   outstanding gubernatorial race of the year has come to a close, with incumbent GOP Gov. Pat McCrory of North Carolina conceding in a Monday video message to Democratic challenger Roy Cooper:         “Despite continued questions that should be answered regarding the voting process, I personally believe that the majority of our citizens have spoken,” McCrory said. McCrory is now the first North Carolina governor to lose reelection. His concession brings to a close a nearly   saga which seemed to grow more  —   not less  —   convoluted and heated by the day, and a   governorship that was marked by flash points on LGBT rights, police brutality and gerrymandering. His defeat is also a rare bright spot in an otherwise dark 2016 election cycle for Democrats: McCrory’s loss makes him the only incumbent governor to lose this year  —   and one of just a handful of sitting governors to lose in the modern era. Cooper, North Carolina’s attorney general, thought this election was over on election night. He claimed victory with a   lead out of 4. 2 million votes cast. But McCrory refused to concede, citing unproven suspicions about manual vote counts in   Durham County. McCrory requested a recount, and he and his allies spent weeks scouring voter rolls across the state for evidence of fraud. But McCrory’s voter fraud challenges failed to present any evidence of the kind of   voter fraud that would swing the election by thousands of votes back to him. At least eight   boards of elections rejected all or most of the challenges because of lack of evidence. And as provisional and absentee ballots were counted, Cooper’s lead surged past 10, 000 votes, which is the state’s maximum vote margin to conduct a recount. So confident was Cooper of his lead, his campaign announced a transition team in the midst of the recount drama.      Roy Cooper, the Democratic challenger in North Carolina’s gubernatorial race, released this video statement on Nov. 18. (Roy Cooper)   “It will be the honor of my life to serve this great state,” Cooper said in a statement Monday after McCrory conceded. McCrory’s    strategy came under criticism from election officials and newspaper editorial boards. In one county, a dead person they claimed voted was actually alive. In another county, two alleged convicted felons were not felons at all. In another, an election protest was thrown out after the GOP lawyer who filed it didn’t show up until after the hearing ended. “It puts a cloud over the integrity of the election process of North Carolina,” said Rhonda Amoroso, a Republican State Board of Elections member, to the Raleigh News & Observer:  There was also a remote possibility that the   legislature could step in to try to settle this. But the chips would have had to fall a very certain way for that to happen, and GOP legislators had indicated that they’d be reluctant to get involved, even to try to save a governor from their own party. McCrory’s camp said that given the closeness of the race, it made sense to wait until every last vote was counted for either side to declare victory. In McCrory’s concession, he reiterated that he still had concerns about voter integrity. The final year of McCrory’s   tenure was marked by drama surrounding some of the country’s touchiest subjects. Prominent LGBT rights groups got involved in trying to unseat McCrory after he signed a bill this spring that limited which public bathrooms transgender people could use and blocked municipalities’ ability to pass    laws. McCrory’s approval rating dropped after the law was signed and backlash to it reverberated across the business, sports and entertainment communities. PayPal pulled out of a deal with the state, and Bruce Springsteen canceled a concert there. The NBA and the NCAA also canceled their moneymaking basketball tournaments in the state. The boiling debate over the bathroom law had just dropped to a simmer this summer when McCrory was forced into yet another defensive position, this time over another controversial bill he signed into law. In July, three judges on a federal appeals court struck down the state’s 2013 voter ID law, writing: “The new provisions target African Americans, with almost surgical precision. ” The court ruling striking down the law was a huge win for voting rights advocates, who had been playing    with voter ID laws across the country. And it was a blow to McCrory just months before the election: North Carolina is fast becoming one of the most crucial swing states, thanks in part to an increasingly politically active African American community whose members overwhelmingly vote Democratic. Then, in September, there was violence, and perhaps the biggest test of McCrory’s term, when    Keith Lamont Scott was fatally shot by a police officer outside a Charlotte apartment complex. Scott’s killing hit a nerve in North Carolina’s largest city, and McCrory declared a state of emergency as protests, some of which turned violent, filled the streets. It was the most intense reaction in several years to a police shooting."
142079,217443,Oakland officials say murder charge possible in warehouse fire,Washington Post,Tim Bontemps,2016-12-05,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161206001457/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2016/12/05/grim-search-suspended-as-death-toll-reaches-36-in-oakland-warehouse-fire/
","         OAKLAND, Calif.  —   The warehouse where at least 36 people died in a massive fire Friday night was essentially “a potential crime scene,” officials said Monday, as they worked on the grim scene during an effort that has stretched on for days. Alameda County District Attorney Nancy O’Malley told reporters at a Monday news conference that while many have asked what kind of criminal charges might be available the case, it remains too early to speculate, but that a murder or involuntary manslaughter charges were possible. “Right now, we have just started our investigation,” she said. “And we owe it to the community, to those who perished in this fire, and those who survived the fire to be methodical, to be thorough, and to take the amount of time it takes to be able to look at every piece of potential evidence. So that if  —   when we get to that point of making a decision, we know that we’re making the right decision, based on the evidence that we have discovered and has been presented. ” Authorities were looking into whether there is any criminal liability attached to the fire, and if, so  —   against whom. That’s not clear right now, she said. “I know that people have been asking us, is this a murder case, what is it?” O’Malley said. “And my answer to you now is the question is whether or not the range of charges could be murder all the way to involuntary manslaughter. And until we know what the evidence shows us, there may be other charges, if the evidence presents that. And we don’t know until we finish our investigation. ”   O’Malley says charges could be anywhere from murder to involuntary manslaughter, but that it’s too early to say if there will be any at all.  —   Tim Bontemps (@TimBontemps) December 5, 2016   O’Malley said that on Saturday morning, officials activated the county’s fire investigation team, which is made up of multiple agencies and is led by her office. She later activated the District Attorney criminal investigation team, which includes an “experienced deputy district attorney,” who works in the real estate division of her office. That man is also an expert in land and property use, O’Malley said. “Once we activated the criminal investigation team, in essence, the scene became a potential crime scene,” she said. O’Malley told reporters that officials would leave “no stone unturned,” and are “following up on every single lead. ” “Several people” have already talked to investigators, she said, and interviews are being scheduled and ongoing. A hotline was also established for those who might have information on the case. Gregory Ahern, of the Alameda County Sheriff’s Office, told reporters Monday that a total of 36 bodies removed. Of those 36 bodies, officials have tentatively identified 33. Sixteen families have been notified and authorities have five pending notifications that were ongoing. Of the 36 bodies, 22 autopsies had been completed, and additional autopsies are expected to be scheduled, he said. Melinda Drayton, battalion chief for the Oakland Fire Department, said at a news conference Monday morning that crews stopped searching overnight after noticing that a wall at the back of the building was leaning at an alarming angle. The search was halted just after midnight, Drayton said, adding that once it resumes, “we absolutely believe that the number of fatalities will increase. ” Later in the day, Darin White, of the Oakland Fire Department, told reporters that in the meantime, crews worked with personnel from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives on the opposite side of the building, to pinpoint areas the ATF feels might be wear the fire began. Officials are also working to shore up the areas of the site that have structural integrity issues, White said. Once that’s done, authorities can resume body recovery and debris removal efforts in that portion of the building. Officials now believe that the deadly fire started at the back of the warehouse. But Drayton said Monday that significant investigative work is still ahead. “We are no closer to finding a cause,” she said. The death toll makes Friday night’s fire one of the deadliest in recent U. S. history  —   and the deadliest in Oakland since 1991. Firefighters worked nonstop over the weekend, searching through debris and rubble to recover bodies, many of which have been charred beyond recognition. Drayton said crews have searched about 70 percent of the building, a warehouse that was converted into an artists collective and exhibition space and that has been investigated by city officials for blight and illegal structures. Structural engineers will be at the scene Monday morning, and officials hope to resume search efforts within four to six hours, Drayton said.    Firefighters work inside the burned warehouse following in the Fruitvale district of Oakland. (Lucy  )  The massive fire that engulfed the building broke out late Friday night, during a concert attended by more than 50 people. Some of them are still missing. Others have been confirmed among the dead. On Sunday, the coroner’s office released the names of seven: Cash Askew, 22, David Cline, 24, Travis Hough, 35, and Donna Kellogg, 32, all of Oakland; Nick   25, of Coronado, Calif.; Sara Hoda, 30, of Walnut Creek, Calif. and Brandon Chase Wittenauer, 32, of Hayward, Calif. The youngest victim identified as of Sunday afternoon was 17 years old. That person’s name was not being released. President Obama said his administration has made efforts to help local and state officials in the investigation. “While we still don’t know the full toll of this disaster, we do know that an American community has been devastated, and many people  —   including young men and woman with their whole futures ahead of them  —   have tragically lost their lives,” Obama said in a statement Monday. Oakland, the president said, “is one of the most diverse and creative cities in our country, and as families and residents pull together in the wake of this awful tragedy, they will have the unwavering support of the American people. ” Visible police activity was subdued Monday morning after officials halted their search overnight due to unsafe building conditions. The smell of burned debris no longer lingered, but the sidewalk in front of the building remained walled off by Alameda County Sheriff’s Office tents as rescue vehicles packed the neighboring Wendy’s parking lot.   Body count remains at 36. Tentatively have identified 33, with 16 families having been notified. Three foreigners: Finland, Korea, Guatemala  —   Tim Bontemps (@TimBontemps) December 5, 2016     22 autopsies have already been completed. Additional autopsies are scheduled to be completed tomorrow.  —   Tim Bontemps (@TimBontemps) December 5, 2016     Sheriff’s Department says they are not expecting a ”huge number” of additional bodies to be removed from the warehouse moving forward.  —   Tim Bontemps (@TimBontemps) December 5, 2016       Sol Rodriguez, center, and Aaron Torres visit a shrine for the victims. (Marcio Jose  )  Lining the metal police barricades at a nearby intersection were flower bouquets, candles and a poster that read “We empower our people to heal our hearts. ” A sparse crowd gathered near the police tape surrounding the area. Locally known as Ghost Ship, the building is owned by Chor Ng and was leased to Derick Almena and his wife, Micah Allison. Almena started the artists collective, and he and Allison managed the space and allowed artists to live there for a small fee. The building’s interior featured a tangled network of antique furniture, artwork, musical instruments, wooden lofts, tapestries and oddities, such as mannequin parts, according to a Tumblr blog that appears to show the building. A makeshift staircase made of wooden pallets led to a second floor. By the time firefighters first arrived at the scene Friday, the second floor had burned down, and the building’s roof had collapsed. The building’s instability hampered search efforts over the weekend, and the structure was initially deemed too unsafe for crews to go in. Firefighters moved slowly in the search, walking amid fallen beams and smoldering ruins as they looked for bodies. They undertook their mission at great risk, with ceilings and floors in danger of collapse. The firefighters ranged in experience from a few months to 30 years, but all were affected by the intensity of the blaze and the piles of bodies they encountered along the way, officials said.  “We had firefighters with basically coveralls and buckets and shovels, taking bits of debris out into the vacant lot, to be then loaded into dump trucks and removed to an   location,” Drayton said Sunday. “This will be a long and arduous process, but we want to make sure we are respecting the victims, their families and our firefighters’ safety to work slowly and carefully through the building. ” Drayton said majority of the victims were found in the middle of the building. It remains unclear if the fire started on the first or second floor. The fire began about 11:30 p. m. Friday, as partygoers gathered on the second floor to listen to a music group called Golden Donna. The band played before a dance floor of about 2, 500 square feet. The music event’s Facebook page was quickly flooded with inquiries from people looking for their loved ones or offering their assistance to families and friends of the victims. Questions remain about whether electrical issues, pyrotechnics or errant candles or cigarettes started the fire. Fire officials said the building did not have sprinklers. A criminal investigation team was sent to the site, officials said. Officer Johnna Watson, spokeswoman for the Oakland Police Department, said that the answers won’t come anytime soon and that officials are more focused on keeping families informed. “They want to have answers,” she said. “We want to provide answers not only for the families, but for our community. ”  The warehouse, on 31st Avenue near one of East Oakland’s main thoroughfares, had long been the subject of complaints. Local officials said they were alerted to possible code violations on Nov. 13, but they could not get inside the structure when they visited four days later. Local news outlets reported that a number of artists used the building as their sleeping quarters as well as studios. Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf said complaints as recent as November cited blight, trash and debris around the building, as well as illegal construction and residential use inside. An inspector who recently visited the warehouse documented the blight outside but was unable to go in. An investigation on possible illegal housing is pending. Almena said his “heart is broken” over the deaths, according to NBC News. Efforts to reach Almena on Monday were unsuccessful. A number listed under his name was not accepting voice mails. Shortly after the fire broke out, Almena wrote a Facebook post lamenting the loss of everything he’d worked for. He later clarified those comments. “In my previous Facebook post, I had no idea there was loss of life,” he said in a statement to NBC News. “This tragic event consumes my every moment. My heart is broken. My heartfelt condolences to the family and friends who have suffered the loss of loved ones. ” He added: “My goal has been nothing less than to create an environment for art and creativity in our community. During this investigation please continue to show support and compassion for those affected by this tragedy. The prayers of my family and I go out to the families of the victims. ” Guerra and Larimer reported from Washington. Michael Kranish contributed to this report. READ MORE Few women fight wildfires.

142080,217444,Georgia father sentenced to life in prison for the hot car death of his 22-month-old son,Washington Post,Amy B Wang,2016-12-05,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161206001457/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2016/12/05/justin-ross-harris-sentenced-to-life-in-prison-in-hot-car-death-of-22-month-old-son/
","     On a clear and sunny Wednesday morning in June two years ago, Justin Ross Harris ate breakfast at a    in northwest Atlanta. With him was his    son, Cooper, strapped into his   car seat in the back row of their Hyundai Tucson. Harris was supposed to drop Cooper off at his day care. Instead, he drove straight to work, parked his vehicle and went inside  —   leaving Cooper in the SUV.   surveillance cameras would later show that Harris returned to his car after going out to lunch with his   to put away some lightbulbs he had bought, but didn’t get inside the vehicle himself. Harris ultimately left work around 4:15 p. m. Five minutes later, he pulled over into a shopping center just a few miles away where, according to police records, Harris pulled Cooper out of the car and tried to perform CPR. “My God, what have I done?” Harris screamed then while sobbing, his attorneys later said in court. “I killed my boy. I’m so sorry, Cooper, I’m so sorry. ” Cooper was pronounced dead a couple of hours later. According to investigators, the temperature near the car seat inside the SUV had reached 120 degrees Fahrenheit. The medical examiner noted that Cooper had “parched abrasions” to his scalp, right forehead and left cheek. “The lips are parched,” the medical examiner’s report read. “The tongue and gums are pale. ” The cause of death was recommended to be hyperthermia. Harris was arrested and charged with murder. His case, which has spanned more than two years, was widely publicized as people scrutinized every aspect of the trial and the Harris family’s past. The case attracted so much coverage that the trial itself had to be moved more than 300 miles away, to Brunswick, Ga. Over two years, Harris’s defense attorneys argued that the    father was a devoted parent who had simply suffered a memory lapse in leaving Cooper in the car. Cooper’s death, they argued, was the result of a tragic accident that could have  —   and has  —   happened to other parents.  Prosecuting attorneys laid out a different case: that Harris was an adulterer with “a malignant heart” who frequently sexted with women outside his marriage  —   including while his son was left in the hot car that day  —   and had intentionally killed Cooper so that he could escape his responsibilities as a father. “It’s not a case of an adult hating his child,” prosecutor Chuck Boring told jurors in his final argument to jurors last month, according to the Associated Press. “It’s just that he loved himself and his other obsessions more than that little boy. ” Last month, the jury found Harris guilty on all eight charges against him, including malice murder. Harris, they decided, had left his son in the car to die on purpose. On Monday during the sentencing hearing, prosecutors asked for the maximum sentence allowed by law, declaring that Harris “was driven by selfishness and committed an unspeakable act against his own flesh and blood,” killing his son in “the most torturous, horrific, unimaginable way possible. ” Through much of the hearing, Harris sat expressionless in the packed courtroom, dressed in an orange jumpsuit and shackles. His defense attorneys did not offer to present additional evidence or statements. Cobb County Superior Court Judge Mary Staley Clark sentenced Harris to life in prison, without the possibility of parole, plus 32 years. It was the maximum allowed by law based on the eight charges against him. “Except for the fact that the defendant has no prior criminal record, there is no mitigating fact or circumstance in this case,” Clark said, before announcing the sentence. “This court finds particularly that the defendant intentionally and unnecessarily in a wanton manner, caused and inflicted upon Cooper Harris unnecessary and wanton severe physical and mental pain and agony. ” As she spoke, Clark appeared at times to try to restrain her emotions. She told Harris what he had done was “a violation and dereliction of duty to that child if not love of that child” as he “callously walked away” from his son in the car two years ago. “In June. In Georgia,” she added for emphasis. “The state’s recommendation is the very least that anyone could deem just under the circumstances of this case,” Clark said. She called Harris up to the front of the courtroom just before announcing the sentence. “My final observation is this, Mr. Harris,” Clark said. “I went back and reviewed and thought about your statement to the police and your statement to your wife when you were taken into custody. It stood out to me that in both of those you [stated you] wished you would be an advocate so that people would never do this again to your children. And I would say, perhaps not in the way that you intended, that you in fact have accomplished that goal. ” Harris was led out of the courtroom shortly after 2 p. m. Harris’s defense attorneys have said they plan to file an appeal within 30 days, according to the Atlanta  . “There were breakdowns in this process that occurred,” lead defense attorney Maddox Kilgore told the paper following Harris’s conviction last month. “There were breakdowns in the investigation. There were breakdowns in the   phase, the motions phase. And there were breakdowns in the trial. It’s our belief those breakdowns affected the verdict. ”      As summer temperatures rise, here are a few simple tips from the National Safety Council to keep kids safe. (Tom   Washington Post)   Harris’s charges included one count of sexual exploitation of children and two counts of dissemination of harmful material to minors, because he was found to have exchanged sexually explicit text messages with underage girls. During the trial, several women testified they had sexual relationships with Harris. In October, one of those teenagers testified that the two had been texting on the day Cooper died, while Harris was at work. The girl told jurors that, at about 2 p. m. that day, Harris texted her to ask for a photo of her breasts, according to the AP, which did not name the girl because she was a minor victim of a sex crime. “Yummy,” Harris replied upon receiving the photo. It would be about two more hours before he left work.  Harris’s   Leanna Taylor, divorced Harris earlier this year. Despite that, she gave an emotional testimony in October defending Harris as a loving father who helped with Cooper’s diapers, meals and baths, and who watched cartoons in bed together with his son in the mornings. Taylor acknowledged there were problems in their marriage and that she had caught him texting other women, but she insisted to jurors that Harris would not have left their son in the car to die intentionally. “I knew he was never going to forgive himself,” Taylor testified, according to the AP. “He wanted to be the one to push him on a swing. He wanted to be the one to slide down the slide with him   …     He wanted to enjoy every second he could with him. ” According to the National Safety Council, more than two dozen children have died of heatstroke in 2016 after being left or trapped in hot cars. “Maybe it’s an overworked parent who forgets to drop off their child at daycare, or a relative who thinks the child will be okay ‘for just a few minutes,’” says an NSC pamphlet on the issue. The group advises parents to put something they will need by their child’s carseat  —   a purse, wallet or phone, for example  —   as an additional reminder to check the back. “Remember, children overheat four times faster than adults,” says a message on the council’s website. “A child is likely to die when his body temperature reaches 107 degrees, and that can happen in minutes. ” Those who see a child alone in a car are advised to call 911 immediately or even break into the car during an emergency, the group said, noting that many states have Good Samaritan laws.

","  LONDON  —   The British people spoke in June: They want out of the European Union. But more than five months after the country’s referendum, the question of who actually gets to pull the trigger on Brexit remains a muddle. Prime Minister Theresa May says she does. A   British court argued otherwise last month, ruling that Parliament must have a say.  Now it’s up to the U. K. Supreme Court, which on Monday began hearing arguments in a case that could complicate May’s plan to set in motion Britain’s exit by the end of March. The case, one of the most constitutionally significant for Britain in decades, will determine whether May and her government can use a prerogative once reserved for kings and queens to invoke Article 50, the    mechanism for getting out of the E. U. Her attorney general, Jeremy Wright, argued Monday before an   panel that the power is “not an ancient relic” but instead “a fundamental pillar of our constitutional state. ”  The June referendum, Wright said, was conducted “with the universal expectation that the government would implement the result. ”  Complicating that argument, however, is the fact that the referendum was not legally binding. The High Court for England and Wales said last month that Britain’s tradition of “parliamentary sovereignty” dictated that the nation’s lawmakers must be given the final say in any exit.  The outcome of the case  —   which will be argued through Thursday, with a decision expected next month  —   could have significant ramifications for May’s E. U. departure plans.  Unlike the public, which voted 52 percent to 48 in favor of getting out of the E. U. most members of Parliament prefer staying in the bloc.   . U. lawmakers have been careful to insist that they have no plans to overturn the public’s will. But even so, a Supreme Court decision to place Brexit   in Parliament’s hands could open the door to protracted negotiations even before Britain begins its   divorce proceedings with the E. U. Shami Chakrabarti, legal affairs spokeswoman for the opposition Labour Party, told the BBC on Monday that Brexit “will happen, pursuant to the will of the people. ” But she added that the party intends to use parliamentary debate to shape the final package.  “There is not a simple question of in and out of the European Union,” she said. “There are many questions that Parliament has to scrutinize about what happens next. ” A spokeswoman for May, speaking on the customary condition of anonymity, told journalists on Monday that opposition parties are trying to “frustrate the will of the British people by slowing down the process of leaving and trying to tie the hands of the government negotiation. ”  The court case has reignited passions that have barely cooled since the June vote. After last month’s High Court ruling, British backers of E. U. membership celebrated while Brexit advocates condemned the judgment.  “Enemies of the People,” read the banner headline on the front page of the   Daily Mail. Above those words were photos of the three judges.  On Monday, rival protesters  —   some dressed as judges  —   staged small demonstrations outside the court. Brexit champion Nigel Farage had initially planned a   rally on Monday in support of an exit. But he canceled those plans last week amid fears that it could lead to violence.       "

","  ROME  —   Italy’s   parties vowed Monday to join forces with other insurgents around Europe as Prime Minister Matteo Renzi prepared to resign, but it was unclear whether an unlikely alliance of disaffected voters could propel the populists to office. Italy plunged into political uncertainty Monday after the decisive defeat of Renzi’s signature constitutional revision plan, which was meant to strengthen his hand and defuse the   movement. The rejection by voters had the opposite outcome. Now,     populists on the left and right who have steadily built power as an alternative to Italy’s    political leadership are seeking to transform their success into a chance at their nation’s highest office. The eclectic Five Star movement is polling at 30 percent, neck and neck with Renzi’s   Democratic Party. “A lesson for everyone: You can’t always lie to the people without suffering the consequences,” said Beppe Grillo, the caustic comedian who founded the Five Star movement.      Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi announced he would resign after the results of a referendum showed voters rejected constitutional reforms meant to streamline the lawmaking process. (Reuters)   But markets and leaders elsewhere in Europe reacted with caution Monday to the Italian shifts, reflecting the steep barriers that remain before insurgents could capture Italy’s top job. The youthful,    Renzi had portrayed himself as a lone warrior against the Euroskepticism that fueled Britain’s vote in June to break with the European Union and gave tail winds to   political leaders in France and elsewhere. “This is something that is going on all over Europe, if you look at the momentum,” said Manlio Di Stefano, a Five Star lawmaker in the lower house of Parliament. “People are really tired of the same kind of politics. Every term is the same, every government is the same, so people are reacting. ” But Renzi also alienated Italian voters over 2½ years in office by failing to   growth in Europe’s   economy. The referendum results  —   59 percent of voters opposed the revisions  —   may have reflected enmity toward Renzi as much as a wave of populism washing over the Italian electorate. Much like the coalition of    voters and the   establishment that drove Donald Trump to victory in the United States, the forces that united to defeat Renzi came from across Italy’s political spectrum. The diverse views may make collaboration difficult.  The decision about Renzi’s successor as prime minister falls to Italian President Sergio Mattarella, an establishment stalwart who is unlikely to clear an easy path for Five Star backers. A likely scenario could be a caretaker government headed by a different leader from Renzi’s   Democratic Party who would hold office until new elections in early 2018. Mattarella asked Renzi on Monday to hold off on his resignation until the government passes next year’s budget, a potential delay of a few days or a week that will buy some time for succession planning but does not significantly alter the political situation.     Meet the European leaders hoping to cause the next Brexit View Graphic     Meet the European leaders hoping to cause the next Brexit  Once Renzi’s successor is announced, the process of forming a new government will take weeks. Italy is no stranger to political chaos, and the next government will be the 64th in 70 years. But many Italians are growing weary of a long stretch of unelected prime ministers, going back to 2011. “The people do not recognize their vote in the government. Because it’s what in the E. U. context is called a deficit of democracy,” said Stefano Stefanini, a former senior Italian diplomat who is now a political consultant in Brussels. Mainstream parties also plan an overhaul of an electoral law that would make it far harder for the Five Star movement to govern without a coalition, yet another barrier to its quest to capture office. The Five Star movement has a patchwork collection of policies that are more Bernie Sanders than Donald Trump. Grillo, the founder, has praised Trump and agitated against migrants, but many of the movement’s rank and file have softer edges. The party has promised to hold a referendum on Italy’s membership in the euro zone if it captures office, criticizing the currency as a project of the elite that has harmed ordinary Italian workers. The movement also agitates against corruption and for the environment. And it forms many of its policies through an online platform for its members that it brags is a   tool for direct democracy.  But when Five Star members have captured power, they have sometimes had difficulty governing, most notably in Rome, where a Five Star mayor has struggled to deliver public services since she took office in the spring.  The mayor of Turin has done better. But she trained at one of Italy’s top universities, is from a prominent business family and has governed as a moderate. “The Italians are essentially unhappy with the establishment, with the establishment parties. They are looking at the Five Star movement, but they are still looking for credible faces,” said Wolfango Piccoli,   of  Teneo Intelligence, a political risk consulting firm.  Even if the insurgent populists never come to office, they are guiding the national political discussion by sending mainstream politicians scrambling to appeal to their   voters. “By simply being there, they shape the political agenda, and they force the system to react to them,” Piccoli said. If the Five Star movement does succeed in calling a referendum on the euro, the move could pressure Italy’s shaky banking sector and rekindle the euro crisis. Shares in Italian bank stocks were broadly down Monday; the nation’s most troubled bank, Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena, lost 3. 9 percent in   trading. But reflecting the overall   calm, Italy’s main stock exchange in Milan was slightly down in   trading. Many other European markets, including London’s FTSE and Germany’s DAX, were up. European leaders said Monday that they were confident Italian politicians would overcome the turbulence without setting off a broader crisis on the troubled continent, which has struggled in the face of Greece’s fiscal collapse and an unprecedented surge of migrants and refugees.  “This is a strong country with strong government, and I have every confidence in Italy to deal with the situation,” Pierre Moscovici, the senior E. U. official in charge of economics, told France 2 television. Yet the Five Star movement is surging against its competitors.  In    polling against the ruling Democratic Party, it is the clear favorite, with an advantage of 53 percent to 47 percent, according to a survey from the EMG polling group released Sunday. Measured against all the parties in Italy, Five Star and the Democratic Party are in a dead heat. Renzi allies said Monday that the rejection of the constitutional changes has dealt Italy a significant blow. “The risk of disintegration began with Brexit, when a very important member was lost,” said Sandro Gozi, a top Renzi ally who is Italy’s undersecretary of state for European affairs. “The European Union needs to depart from the status quo, because it makes the future much harder. ”   Birnbaum reported from Brussels.

","    CITY | This is part of a continuing series that will examine issues related to repeat violent offenders in the District of Columbia. Part I | Part II | Part III        On a warm summer night, Kristin Van Goor was jolted awake by the sound of knocking. She hurried down the wooden staircase in her pajamas. Through the windows, she saw red and blue police lights flashing, and her husband, Dave, on the doorstep. A detective in a police cruiser shouted, “Are you all good?” Dave gave a nod and walked inside their Hill East home, just after midnight. Dave paced in the living room. The memories spilled out in jagged pieces. He remembered the black gun held to his head. Three young men, wearing black masks over their faces, surrounded him as he walked home from the   Metro station about 11:30 p. m. on Aug. 20, 2015. They grabbed his backpack. They took his phone and laptop, his wallet and keys. They dug deeper still into his pockets and fished out the last bit of loose change. Just get through this, Dave thought. Just survive. During the days and months to follow, one young man would be linked to the crime. In a span of several months, he would leave a trail of terror across the region, only to be granted a break under the Youth Rehabilitation Act, a D. C. law often used by judges seeking to give second chances to young violent offenders. The man’s case is one of more than 3, 000 felony sentences handed down since 2010 under the law, which allows for leniency in some sentences and the opportunity for offenders to emerge with no criminal record. The story that brings together that young man, the Van Goors and other victims illuminates the difficulty of trying to protect a young man’s future and society at the same time. It also shows how victims suffer not just during the crime, but also in the aftermath  —   how the system can leave them disillusioned and deliver not justice but frustration. This account is based on interviews with the victims, and on police reports and court records. On that night in August 2015, Dave Van Goor saw only the masked men surrounding him. One of them demanded his iPhone passcode. The man held the gun sideways and pointed it toward Dave’s temple.  “Right     now!” he yelled. After they got the code, the men sprinted into an alleyway and fled into the darkness. Dave ran to get help. Good Samaritans in a nearby apartment building called 911. Police officers took his statement and drove him back to the safety of his home. But Dave and Kristin didn’t feel safe. Not that night. And not in the weeks and months to follow. It was their first night of a   journey in a new role: victims.  Both had earned PhDs in scientific fields. Dave, then 38, was a student at George Washington University Law School and worked for a law firm; Kristin, 35, had a job at a biopharmaceutical company. The criminals who brazenly robbed Dave at gunpoint, on a residential street just a mile and a half from the U. S. Capitol, now had the keys to their house and car. “How are we supposed to sleep?” Kristin asked. “We are sitting ducks. ” One police officer told the Van Goors not to worry. Criminals never return to the scene of the crime, he said.   years of experience told him so. But the Van Goors worried anyway. At 1 a. m. they walked outside and fastened a club over the steering wheel of their black Volkswagen Tiguan SUV. The key to the club was already in the hands of the robbers. The couple hoped the robbers might not think of it. The Van Goors retreated to the basement with their jittery labradoodle, Darwin. There were credit cards to cancel. Insurance companies to call. Locks to be changed. Dave huddled with Kristin and Darwin in the basement. He flipped on the TV and sipped some Scotch. The whisky dulled his nerves and soothed his anger. He drank a little more and drifted to sleep just before dawn.    The missing car:   7:45 a. m. Friday, Aug. 21, 2015     Kristin Van Goor (Linda   Washington Post)  Kristin was up early the next morning, with plans to drive to Baltimore for a work meeting. The Van Goors had parked their Tiguan behind a motorcycle less than a block from their home on A Street NE. The motorcycle was there. But the SUV was gone, just an empty space in its place. Kristin shouted to a family across the street, “Did you happen to see a black Tiguan parked here?” They had not. Kristin ran to tell Dave. “Are you     kidding me?” he said. She called 911 about 8 a. m. She called again at 8:39 a. m. A dispatcher told her that they were busy with   calls. At 11:26 a. m. Kristin called once more. Officer Topaz Proctor responded, and Kristin yelled at him on the doorstep. Dave tried to calm her. She apologized for snapping at the officer. Now, they had more paperwork to handle: A new police statement. A call to the car insurance company. And a contract for a rental car.    The first clue:   Monday, Aug. 24, 2015  In the Van Goors’ mail was an envelope with no return address. Inside the envelope: a handwritten note, dated Aug. 21, 2015  —   the day after the armed robbery. The envelope also contained a reimbursement check from her company, made out to Kristin, for $95.   Hello Ms. Van Goor,   My name is Brenda, and on my way to work this morning I found this check near Texas Ave. and Dubois St. in S. E.   Days before the robbery, Kristin had signed the check and asked Dave to deposit it for her. It had been in his stolen backpack. Kristin immediately called Brenda to thank her and to tell her about the robbery. Then, she called the police. She thought the note was an important clue. If the check was found on a street in the Benning Ridge neighborhood, their Tiguan had to be nearby. Maybe the robbers lived in the neighborhood. She got through to a D. C. police detective who said that he knew the neighborhood quite well. “Go look for my car,” she begged. He later told the Van Goors that he spent a few hours looking but had no luck.    The next victim:  7:50 a. m. Friday, Aug. 28, 2015     Kimberly   recalls being robbed last year by a young man with a gun while walking in an alley adjacent to where she worked at the Center City Public Charter School in Southeast Washington. (Linda   Washington Post)  Kimberly   40, had just a few days to prepare for the first week of school at Center City, a charter school in the Hill East neighborhood. As the assistant principal, she had plenty of work to do. On her drive to school,    sang along to gospel tunes in her Honda Civic. Just before 8 a. m. she parked in a lot beside the school and unloaded three bags: a Michael Kors purse, a computer bag and a Kate Spade workbag filled with school supplies, a hammer and paint to redecorate her office. Still humming, she walked through the parking lot and into an alley on her way to the front door of the school. Then she saw a young man, dressed in a loose white   and black pants with a skullcap on his head, lingering nearby in the alley. “I saw him clear as day,” she said. The public high school, Eastern, was just down the block. Classes had already begun there, and she thought he was probably a student at Eastern. She passed him and then heard his footsteps scraping the gravel on the pavement behind her. She moved to the right, thinking he wanted to pass her along the   fence. Suddenly, he grabbed her purse strap, and she turned to face him. She racked her brain. She had taught for 17 years in the District. Maybe she knew his name. If I can call his name, maybe he won’t do this, she thought. He raised his shirt, flashing the handle of a gun tucked into his waistband. He put a finger to his mouth, signaling for her to be quiet. She then handed over her workbag and her purse, containing her wallet, cash, credit cards, driver’s license, and keys to her Civic and her home. He pointed at her computer bag, which held her MacBook. “Do you want that?” he asked, with chilling calm. “Yes,” she begged. “Please. ” Inside, there were irreplaceable work files. Student projects. Years of lesson plans. “Nah, give me that, too,” he told her. He took her last bag and then motioned for her to walk away. Her back toward him, she walked down the alley along the   fence toward the street. Her eyes were closed. She feared he was going to shoot her. She willed herself to keep walking. Just be numb. At the end of the alley, her eyes were still clenched shut. She opened her eyes, turned left and sprinted up the steps to the charter school. “Help me!” she screamed. “I’ve been robbed!”      Kimberly   a former assistant principal, was walking toward her school when she was robbed by a youth armed with a gun. She describes her encounter with the gunman. (Whitney  )      A crime alert: 8:15 a. m. Friday, Aug. 28, 2015  A block away, Kristin Van Goor stood in line at Mia’s, a local coffee shop. It had been a week since her husband was robbed. She read a new email on her phone. There was an urgent neighborhood crime alert: Someone had just been robbed at gunpoint, and the robber was on the loose in Hill East. Kristin had planned to walk to the Metro from the coffee shop, but she changed her mind. She decided to return home and drive her rental car instead.    A stakeout: Midmorning, Friday, Aug. 28, 2015  Dispatchers broadcast details of the crime to police officers in the neighborhood. Officer Proctor heard the description of the robber  —   of a young black male with a black skull cap and white  . Just moments before the robbery, the officer had seen a young man driving a black Volkswagen Tiguan who matched that description.    Kimberly   (Linda   Washington Post)  Kimberly  ’s husband drove into the District from their home in Upper Marlboro, Md. with the family’s spare car keys. She and her husband wanted to quickly move her Honda Civic away from the school parking lot. The gunman had the keys, and they thought he might come back for it. They moved the car back to their home. Officers staked out the school parking lot for several hours, thinking the man might return to try to find the car. At 10:56 a. m. they once again spotted the young black man, driving the Tiguan near the parking lot. When they tried to stop him, he fled east on East Capitol Street. About three miles from the start of the pursuit by police, the driver crashed the Tiguan into a city   machine near 51st Street and Ayers Place SE. The driver and two other men bailed out of the car. After a brief foot chase, the officers caught the driver but lost sight of the other men. Inside the SUV, they recovered  ’s ID card. On the passenger side, they found a .  semiautomatic pistol on the floor.    A ‘ ’ identification: 12:35 p. m. Friday, Aug. 28, 2015  After they caught the suspect, police called   at home. She needed to return to the school, where a police detective would be waiting for her.   sat in the back seat of the police cruiser as a detective drove her on East Capitol toward Southern Avenue. She was going to see the gunman in person. They arrived about a block away from the scene of the crash. The detective told   that he would record her reactions.    The Van Goors’ totaled Volkswagen Tiguan. (Courtesy of the Van Goor family)    would be asked to take a live look at the young man in handcuffs to see whether she could confirm that he was the man who robbed her.   was confident that she would be able to identify him. She had made an effort to stare into the young man’s eyes. She would not forget them. In clear view, they walked the young man toward the police SUV in the street. She worried that he could see her through the car windows and knew where she worked. He had her ID. He knew where she lived. She knew it was him. The pants were the same. He had changed his shirt, but he still wore the skullcap. She made the identification. But then she got jittery. Oh, my gosh, she thought. I’m about to send a black male to jail. She asked to see him once more. She thought of her own son. If you’re about to send this young man to jail, you better know for sure, she thought. She identified him for the second time, 100 percent sure. Later, police asked her to come to the station, where she collected some of the items that were recovered from the Tiguan. When the detective briefly left the room, she peered over his desk. There was a police photo of the young man who robbed her. And for the first time, a name: Joshua Mayo.      Kimberly   describes what it was like to identify the man with a gun who robbed her. (Whitney  )      Preliminary hearing: Tuesday, Sept. 1, 2015:  After being arrested on suspicion of armed robbery, Mayo was taken to Children’s National Medical Center in the District for minor injuries sustained in the crash. He was two weeks shy of his 18th birthday, but he would be charged as an adult in the armed robbery of  .    Joshua Mayo (Prince George’s County Department of Corrections)  The Aug. 29 charging papers also revealed a direct link between Mayo and the Van Goors: The Tiguan he crashed was their stolen SUV. Three days later, Mayo appeared in D. C. Superior Court for a preliminary hearing. Magistrate Judge Frederick Sullivan heard testimony from Officer Proctor, who described spotting Mayo in the Tiguan near the school parking lot, wearing a skullcap. Sullivan said there was “plenty” of probable cause to move forward. “Your client’s involved himself in extremely dangerous conduct,” Sullivan told the defense attorney. “He’s sticking a gun into people and taking their property . . . and then he’s fleeing in an automobile with other guys in the automobile and it looks as though there may be a couple of different crimes here. ” He ordered Mayo held without bond. A Pretrial Services official noted that there were also two arrest warrants for Mayo in connection with armed robberies in Prince George’s County, Md. in July. On Sept. 4, 2015, the Van Goors learned from a police officer that their stolen SUV had been recovered. They were told few details, only that their vehicle had been used as a getaway car in an armed robbery.    Joshua Mayo: Early fall 2015  Armed with the name “Joshua Mayo,”   took matters into her own hands. She wanted to know why Joshua was not in school on the day of the robbery, the first week of public school in the District. Her mind was racked with questions for him: Was it fun? Were you just doing this for kicks? Or were you doing this because you thought it was the way to survive? Assistant U. S. Attorney Vivien Cockburn was assigned to her case. “All the prosecutors would say is that he had been in a little bit of trouble,”   said. “They kept saying, ‘He’s done this before.’ ” She received an official letter telling her that she was the victim of a crime. It laid out her rights for compensation. The price of changing her locks  —   $716  —   could be covered by a victim’s fund. Meanwhile, the Van Goors were in the dark. “Every time I called the prosecutor’s office, they had no idea what was going on,” Kristin said. “When I tried to call back, I was never able to figure out if Dave’s robbery had been reviewed by a prosecutor or even been assigned to a prosecutor. ” No charges had been filed against Mayo for the crimes involving their family: the armed robbery of Dave and the theft and destruction of their SUV. Eventually, they learned from Cockburn that Joshua Mayo was the man who crashed their SUV. At 8:30 p. m. on Sept. 14, a woman named Rekha Patil showed up on the Van Goors’ doorstep. She asked for Dave, acting friendly, Kristin recalled. Kristin assumed she was a law school classmate. But Patil was an investigator for the D. C. Public Defender Service. She was there to help defend Joshua Mayo. She wanted to ask about the robbery. Kristin screamed at her to leave, immediately. Like Kristin, Kimberly   also had a bitter   with a woman from the Public Defender Service. She could not remember the woman’s name but said she did not think it was Patil. The woman, who had jet black hair pulled back into a ponytail, showed up at her school on Oct. 1, claiming to work for the defense team of Joshua Mayo. “I really want to talk to you because I don’t think you know what you’re doing,” the woman said, according to  ’s account. “You’re about to send an innocent young man to jail. ” “He wasn’t a young man the day he robbed me,”   said she told her. Patil referred a reporter to her bosses for comment. In a statement to The Washington Post, the Public Defender Service responded that its investigators have a constitutional right and duty to attempt to interview witnesses to crimes as part of the defense case. “PDS investigators need to, often under very tight time constraints, attempt to speak with any witnesses and victims to get their side of the story,” said Janet Mitchell, PDS supervising attorney. “Investigators are instructed to be persistent but also professional and respectful. ”    Kimberly   in the alley where she was robbed. (Linda   Washington Post)     The makings of a deal: Friday, Oct. 2, 2015  The next day, Mayo was offered a deal by the U. S. attorney’s office. The paperwork revealed yet another twist in Mayo’s brief but violent history.  He had been linked to a third armed robbery in the District of Columbia. In April 2015, a group of young men approached a    man in Southeast Washington and stole his phone. They also shot him in his right arm. With the stolen Samsung Galaxy phone, they made a selfie video of joy rides around the city. In the video, they blow smoke and flash a gun, laughing. What they did not know, however, was that the video automatically uploaded to the victim’s online cloud storage. Their faces were clearly visible. The victim turned the video over to police. In August, the D. C. police posted the video online and asked for tips. An anonymous tipster identified Joshua Mayo. On Sept. 4, after he had been charged with armed robbery in  ’s case, Mayo was charged with another count of armed robbery for taking the    man’s cellphone. Prosecutors wrote that Mayo, under D. C. law, would face a mandatory minimum prison term of five years for each armed robbery, since they were separate crimes. If convicted, he would be spending a mandatory 10 years in prison. But they offered him a generous plea deal. They would dismiss the charge of the first armed robbery  —   connected with the cellphone theft and shooting  —   in exchange for a plea to a misdemeanor charge of receipt of stolen property. The misdemeanor carried a penalty of 180 days in jail. For the second   charge  —   the crime against Kimberly    —   prosecutors would agree to accept an admission by Mayo of committing an armed robbery with an imitation weapon, even though police officers had recovered a real firearm  —   the .  semiautomatic pistol. The significance of the imitation weapon: Mayo would no longer be subject to the mandatory minimum of five years for armed robbery.  “I was like, ‘Are you kidding me?’ ”   said. “I knew damn well it wasn’t a toy gun. ” Richard Tischner, chief of the Superior Court Division for the U. S. attorney’s office, said “imitation weapon” clauses are sometimes stipulated as part of plea negotiations, even if real guns are used in the crimes. “It’s not a lie,” he told The Post. “It’s a concession to the case. ”    Signing the deal: 10 a. m. Friday, Oct. 9, 2015  Mayo pleaded guilty before Judge Todd Edelman. The judge approved a defense attorney’s request for a Youth Rehabilitation Act study for Mayo, who was now 18 years old.   had heard of the law before. As a teacher, she had worked with young men who had received the benefit of the law. “Tell me your thoughts about it,” Cockburn asked her, according to  ’s recollection.   said she opposed it in Mayo’s case. “In some cases, I just feel like it doesn’t work,” she said. “Especially if he’s been in trouble already. At some point and time, you have to be fully responsible for your actions. ” The   plea deal had been infuriating to   . And now, Mayo was up for the Youth Rehabilitation Act. “It really is a game,” she told The Post.      Kimberly   a victim of armed robbery, describes how she felt about the plea deal the assailant was offered under the Youth Rehabilitation Act. (Whitney  )      A victim’s connection: Wednesday, Oct. 14, 2015  It had been six weeks since the car crash, and the Van Goors had not been allowed to see their vehicle. Finally, on a Wednesday morning, the Van Goors traveled to an impound lot in Southwest Washington to take a look at their totaled Tiguan. The front end was completely bashed in, and the car reeked of mold. The Van Goors desperately wanted one item back: Dave’s keychain. It held a small memento in honor of his brother, who had died several years before. The SUV was full of rubbish: umbrellas,   frozen lunches and cologne. The cup holders were filled with cigarette ashes. They could not find the key chain. But they did find a debit card, in a side pocket of the SUV. It belonged to a woman named Kimberly  . Kristin did a Google search for the woman’s name. She saw that the woman worked as an assistant principal at Center City charter school. Later that afternoon, Kristin called the school and asked to speak with  . The two women swapped stories over the phone.   told Kristin that prosecutors had already offered Mayo a plea deal for the school robbery. He had accepted it. Kristin was stunned. No one from the U. S. attorney’s office had told her anything about a plea offer. The offer made a reference to Mayo’s crashing the Van Goors’ SUV but guaranteed that he would face no further charges in the incident.    The indictment: Tuesday, Feb. 2, 2016  While Joshua Mayo was in the D. C. jail awaiting sentencing, a grand jury impaneled in Prince George’s County indicted him on charges of armed robbery, robbery,   assault,   assault, use of a firearm in a crime of violence, theft and conspiracy. Meanwhile, jail officials in the District conducted a Youth Rehabilitation Act study ordered by Judge Edelman to see whether Mayo could benefit from rehabilitative treatment. The results would not be disclosed to the public, but they would be given to Edelman.    Conflicting thoughts: Winter 2016    was on the fence about attending the sentencing. “At the beginning, I was all for it,” she said. “As time went on, the fear set in. ” She refused to go outside for recess. She carried her car keys in her bra. She began carrying a small Taser in her purse. “He will be able to sleep,” she said of Mayo. “I don’t sleep. I watch my back. ” Cockburn told her, repeatedly, that they desperately needed her voice for Judge Edelman’s consideration at the sentencing.   had one request for the prosecutor: If she attended, could she give two books to Mayo? She wanted to share “The Autobiography of Malcolm X” and “Cooked,” the memoir of a prison cook who turned his life around and became a famous casino chef. Cockburn, who declined to be interviewed for this article, told   that it would not be possible.   did not see the point of attending the sentencing.  No one called the Van Goors to inform them of the sentencing date. They learned of it while researching the case through court records. Kristin planned to show up, mainly because she wanted to see Mayo’s face. She believed that he was the young man who held a gun to her husband’s head. But the sentencing was postponed two months, and by that point, the   frustrations had worn her down. She did not attend.      The wife of an   victim describes her reaction to the lenient sentence the robber received under the District’s Youth Rehabilitation Act. (Whitney  )      The sentencing: Tuesday, March 15, 2016  On the day of the sentencing, Cockburn apologized to Judge Edelman for  ’s absence. “I urged the victim to come. And I wanted  —   unfortunately, she is not here today. I wanted to very briefly describe this person to you,” she said. “The victim is this tiny lady. She only comes up to my shoulder, but she is a spitfire. She is a very lively, engaged woman. ” But Cockburn said that over several months, she saw the victim suffer. “She speaks to me on the phone and tells me how she’s now, and has been, afraid to even step out of her own building, and she is the assistant principal,” she said. “This is not a woman that is shaken easily, and yet now, she looks over her shoulder, she finds other people to go outside, and she is struggling. ” Cockburn asked for five years prison time. She said the totality of Mayo’s violent crimes should warrant appropriate punishment. Defense attorney John Fowler, from the Public Defender Service, said the government was too focused on punishment and deterrence rather than rehabilitation. He said Mayo should serve no more than 36 months in prison. Fowler told the judge that Mayo’s upbringing had been plagued by health problems and difficulties in D. C. public schools. Mayo dropped out of school after the 10th grade, according to court records. Fowler told the judge that Mayo had suffered from a heart ailment since he was a toddler. “I don’t think he ever got the support that he needed,” Fowler told the judge. Fowler said that Mayo had “taken advantage of the very limited opportunities” at the D. C. jail. He was attending classes there five days a week to work toward his GED. The attorney said he worried that prison would be particularly hard on Mayo. For instance, if Mayo got into a fight, or took a punch to the face, he said that the consequences could be severe. “He doesn’t have the health of an  ” Fowler said. “He doesn’t have the heart of an   . ” Judge Edelman asked Mayo whether he would like to say anything. “I want to say that I apologize for my actions,” Mayo told the judge. “I own up to them. And I don’t want everybody to say I’m a bad person. ” Edelman, who declined to comment for this article, indicated that he was conflicted. “We have such a young person, who has so much of his life ahead of him and who has arguably been very let down by, for example, our educational system,” he said. “And on the other hand, you have such a chilling act or set of acts here. . . . It’s an armed robbery with a .  handgun. ” Prosecutors had brought up the links between Mayo and the robbery of   the cellphone case and the Van Goor case. “The government submits that the defendant’s connection to three armed robberies is not a coincidence, and indicates a disturbing pattern of criminal activity by the defendant,” the prosecutor’s sentencing memorandum states. Edelman acknowledged that there was “some connection” between Mayo and the two other armed robberies in the District. The judge also made reference to the pending Prince George’s   case, which could bring a sentence of 10 to 15 years. Additionally, the judge mentioned that Mayo had a firearm charge in family court, a juvenile matter that was not part of his adult record. Ultimately, the judge sentenced Mayo to serve 42 months in prison for the armed robbery, with credit for the five months he had already spent in jail. The sentence was 18 months below the mandatory minimum for armed robberies with real guns. The judge also added six months for the misdemeanor    charge connected to the cellphone armed robbery and shooting, for a total of 48 months. Edelman granted the defense attorney’s request for Youth Rehabilitation Act status, saying that it was appropriate to treat Mayo as a youthful offender. And, as the judge pointed out, the prosecutor had not objected. The leniency was infuriating to  . Mayo was getting time shaved off, but she would be scared for life. Hell no, she thought. No one is shaving that off for me.   eventually left her job at the charter school and moved to an alternative school for young adults. She did it for Joshua, she said. “I still believe that no one wakes up and just says, ‘This is who I am,’ ” she said. “Somewhere, he was made into this. Somewhere, he has gotten lost. When I looked into Josh’s eyes that day, I saw a kid. I didn’t see a robber. ” She stopped herself. “Shame on me, maybe,” she said.       Kimberly   describes the new path she is taking with her career as a result of what happened to her. (Whitney  )     The aftermath: Summer 2016  Last spring, Mayo was briefly sent to a federal prison in New Jersey, where he began serving his sentence. This summer, he was extradited to Maryland to face charges in the July 29 armed robberies. Mayo, now 19, pleaded guilty in October to possession of a firearm and two counts of armed robbery and faces between five and 15 years of prison time. He is scheduled to be sentenced in January. Mayo, through his   attorney in Maryland, declined to comment for this article. There have been no charges filed in the armed robbery of Dave Van Goor. The case remains under investigation, according to William Miller, a spokesman for the U. S. attorney’s office. Miller said his office disputes the victims’ assertions about their interactions with prosecutors  —   he said his office had had “extensive communication” with the Van Goor family and contested  ’s account that she was upset about the plea deal. But he declined to provide details or make prosecutors available for interviews. “Generally speaking, we devote considerable time and resources to ensuring that victims are kept informed and heard throughout proceedings, and their views are given strong consideration,” Miller said. The Van Goors tried to move on with their lives, but the fear and the frustration persisted. They still wanted justice. At a minimum, they thought Mayo should be charged with wrecking their SUV. “It’s all so frustrating,” Kristin told The Post. “They arrested the man who totaled it. How is he not being held accountable for what he did?” In June, a family friend wrote a letter on their behalf to Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) and to  . C. Police Chief Cathy L. Lanier and U. S. Attorney Channing Phillips. “The Van Goors’ case is a textbook example of what is wrong with how DC approaches crime, especially how DC approaches violent gun crime,” wrote the friend. Kristin received phone calls from Lanier and the Van Goors’ representative on the D. C. Council, Charles Allen (  6). On June 13, she met with Phillips and two assistants at the Paul bakery a few blocks from the courthouse. “I thank you for bringing your concerns to our attention,” wrote Phillips to Kristin in an email the following day.  “We always strive to do better and your comments were insightful and instructive. ” Kristin was encouraged. Another assistant U. S. attorney, Kacie Weston, soon got in touch with the Van Goors. She had been assigned to review the case. Kristin felt optimistic that prosecutors intended to charge Mayo with felony destruction of property. At the end of August, Weston called Kristin. Weston said her colleagues did not think they could charge Mayo for totaling the Van Goors’ car. Weston explained that Mayo’s signed admission in the plea deal about the car wreck essentially barred prosecutors from pursuing him on that charge. Kristin could not believe it. When she tried to respond, her voice started to crack. Her words failed her. She told the prosecutor she had to go. Choking back tears, she hung up the phone. "
142085,217449,Dylann Roof gets his attorneys back for part of the Charleston church shooting trial,Washington Post,Mark Berman,2016-12-05,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161206001457/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2016/12/05/dylann-roof-wants-his-attorneys-back-for-part-of-the-charleston-church-shooting-trial/
","     The white man charged with killing nine black parishioners inside a Charleston, S. C. church last year, who had asked to represent himself in court, reversed course and now wants his defense attorneys back for part of the trial. This request from Dylann Roof, 22, came less than a week after a judge approved his decision to represent himself in the federal   trial stemming from the church massacre  —   and it was filed just three days before jury selection is scheduled to begin on Wednesday. Roof was indicted on 33 counts related to the massacre at the Emanuel AME Church, and he faces a possible death sentence in the case. He also faces a potential death sentence in a separate state trial on charges of murder and attempted murder; that trial is set to begin in January. U. S. District Judge Richard Gergel agreed to Roof’s latest request on Monday. Gergel had said last month that he would allow Roof to represent himself in the case, though he warned him it was “strategically unwise” to abandon attorneys including David Bruck, who has extensive experience with   cases. Bruck and Roof’s other attorneys had been appointed as standby counsel to assist him during the case.  On Sunday, Roof requested that his attorneys be reinstated to represent him in the first portion of the trial, which deals with whether he will be found guilty. This message was relayed in a   filing from Bruck and Roof’s other attorneys that was followed by a handwritten message signed by Roof:    Roof’s handwritten note. (Court records)  Roof’s request to restore his attorneys deals only with the first portion of the trial and does not extend to the part focusing on the death penalty. If Roof is found guilty, the penalty phase of the trial will focus on whether he should or should not be sentenced to death. Federal authorities have previously outlined some of their reasons he should be sentenced to death, noting in the indictment that three of the victims of the shooting were between 70 and 87 years old. One of the aggravating factors that can warrant a death sentence, according to the federal   statute, is if a victim is “particularly vulnerable due to old age. ” When the Justice Department announced that prosecutors would seek a death sentence, it argued that Roof “demonstrated a lack of remorse,” that he had specifically targeted the church’s Bible study group to “magnify the societal impact” of the rampage and that “his animosity towards African Americans played a role in the murders. ” Roof’s decision to still seek to represent himself in the penalty phase, meanwhile, could impact what evidence is introduced in an effort to keep him off death row. One of the mitigating factors that can be used to argue for life imprisonment rather than a death sentence is whether a defendant has any sort of impairment. Bruck had indicated in a court filing that he intended to raise the issue of Roof’s mental state during the penalty phase, writing in a court document that he planned “to introduce expert evidence relating to a mental disease or defect or any other mental condition bearing on the issue of punishment. ”  After the church massacre, authorities found a manifesto online that belonged to Roof. It was filled with racist characterizations of black people and contained images of Roof holding a Confederate battle flag and standing in front of a Confederate museum. Prosecutors say they believe Roof “ ” online, taking on violent white supremacist beliefs through the Internet. In addition, authorities say they found two handwritten manifestoes from Roof, one in his jail cell and the other in his car, along with a list of churches. Attorneys for Roof have offered to plead guilty in exchange for a life sentence, but federal prosecutors have not accepted that agreement. In a hearing last month, Roof said he wanted to maintain his plea of not guilty in the case. This story, first posted at 9:59 a. m. has been updated.

","   Donald Trump sold all his shares in companies in June, his spokesman said Tuesday, a move that could have created a cash windfall as he ramped up to begin a costly general election presidential campaign that at the time he claimed he would personally support with “major contributions. ”  The   could help address    worries about his stock portfolio, a sizable part of Trump’s financial life that was worth roughly as much as $40 million as of December 2015, a May disclosure filing shows.  Trump’s stock portfolio, the May filing shows, included shares in a number of banks, oil giants and other companies with business pending before the U. S. government and whose value could rise due to Trump’s decisions in office. Those stock holdings, ethics advisers said, offered a potentially troublesome facet of Trump’s private finances that could entangle his public  . Beyond comments to The Post, Trump representatives have not provided records of stock transactions or other details since the May filing. Trump spokesman Jason Miller, who told The Post about Trump’s stock sale Tuesday morning, did not immediately answer why Trump had sold the shares, how much he sold them for, or whether he has bought anything since. Trump will not be required by law to file another personal financial disclosure until May 2018.     Donald Trump has a lot of potential conflicts of interest as president  —   but there’s no law that specifically requires a commander in chief to remove themselves from all of their business interests. The Fix’s Peter W. Stevenson explains why presidents usually put their assets in a ”blind trust” to avoid problems. (Peter   Washington Post)    Trump’s campaign had given no indication of the sale in the five months since it apparently took place in June. As president, Trump will be subject to the STOCK Act, a law passed in 2012 that requires elected officials, including the president, to publicly disclose any stock transactions worth at least $1, 000 within 45 days. Trump has refused to release his tax returns, which would provide more detailed information about his financial holdings. Trump’s stock portfolio, which is separate from his broader real estate and branding businesses, included stocks and bonds invested in companies such as Apple, AT&T, ExxonMobil and Goldman Sachs.  The June stock sale would have coincided with a point when Trump was pouring money into his presidential campaign. During the Republican primary, Trump loaned his campaign $47 million of his own money. In June, as the general election began, he formally forgave the loan and began making cash infusions to his campaign, first donating $2 million on June 22. Trump then gave $2 million a month between July and August before donating $10 million in October. Much of Trump’s campaign was ultimately funded by other donors. In all, Trump gave his campaign $66 million, federal filings show  —   short of the $100 million that he repeatedly claimed he was spending on his race. Miller, the Trump spokesman, told The Post about Trump’s stock sale Tuesday morning, following Trump’s criticism of aviation giant Boeing. Trump tweeted that Boeing’s federal contract to build new Air Force One jets should be cancelled because costs had gone “out of control. ” Trump was once a company shareholder, tweeting in January 2013 that “@Boeing stock went way down because of   so I just bought stock in @  great company!” Trump reported owning between $50, 000 and $100, 000 of Boeing stock in the May filing. In the three years between Trump’s original tweet about buying Boeing stock and June 2016, Boeing’s share price climbed about 70 percent. Trump has tweeted that he will separate from his own business, the Trump Organization, but has provided no additional details other than promising to hold a press event on Dec. 15 to outline his plans.   Trump told Fox Business News in August that he was dumping stocks because he predicted the market was crashing, saying, “I did invest, and I got out, and it was actually very good timing. ” Despite Trump’s August comments, stock prices have generally been on the rise since June. Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks told The Post last month that Trump had in June also sold his shares in Energy Transfer Partners, the majority stakeholder in the $3. 7 billion Dakota Access pipeline project that has drawn protests from environmentalists and Native Americans. The Army Corps of Engineers said Sunday it would not allow the oil pipeline to be drilled further near a Standing Rock Sioux reservation, but Trump has said he supported completing the pipeline. The company’s chief executive was a major campaign donor to Trump, but its stock had declined in value in the face of protests.  Trump said in a financial filing released in May 2015 that he owned between $500, 000 and $1 million worth of stock in Energy Transfer Partners. By May 2016, when Trump updated his annual filing, the value of the holding had fallen to less than $50, 000. Norm Eisen, who served as ethics counselor to President Obama and has criticized Trump over his conflicts, said it would be “absolutely a step in the right direction” if Trump had sold his stock holdings in June, divesting himself of ownership in companies whose fates could be tied to his policies. But he added that it is now important to know how Trump spent the money he earned from the sale. “We need to know, has he put them in conflict free assets . .. or has he bought other stocks or assets that would create new conflicts?” he asked. “It’s all the more reason that we need a prompt and full financial disclosure. If he did liquidate all his stocks, what did he do with the money? What bank is the money in? What did he buy? It’s a lot of money. ” He called this the latest example of the tension between Trump’s promise to drain the swamp and how he has managed his own business conflicts. “The swamp draining should begin with Trump’s own wetlands,” Eisen said.

","           Donald Trump tweeted Tuesday morning that Boeing’s contract to build the next Air Force One should be canceled because of the high cost of the program.  Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!  —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 6, 2016 Boeing was selected as the manufacturer in January 2015, but it wasn’t much of a competition. Boeing’s   was the only plane made in the United States that could meet the requirements for the presidential aircraft while also being “consistent with the national public interest,” Air Force Secretary Deborah Lee James said in a statement at the time. She insisted that the Pentagon “will insist upon program affordability through   procurement practices. ”  Talking to reporters Tuesday morning at Trump Tower in Manhattan, Trump explained his tweet: “The plane is totally out of control. It’s going to be over $4 billion for Air Force One program, and I think it’s ridiculous. I think Boeing is doing a little bit of a number. We want Boeing to make a lot of money, but not that much money. ” And in a call with reporters, Trump spokesman Jason Miller said that Trump plans to closely examine the Pentagon’s budget and look for areas where he can find savings. “I think this really speaks to the  ’s focus on keeping costs down across the board with regard to government spending,” he said. “I think people are really frustrated with some of the big price tags that are coming out for programs, even in addition to this one. So we’re going to look for areas where we can keep costs down and look for ways where we can save money. ” The entire cost of the program, including development costs, is expected to reach $4 billion, according an analysis by Todd Harrison, a defense analyst with the Center for Strategic and International Studies. In a statement, Boeing said that so far it is only under contract for $170 million. And that’s not yet for manufacturing, but rather “to help determine the capabilities of this complex military aircraft that serves the unique requirements of the President of the United States. We look forward to working with the U. S. Air Force on subsequent phases of the program allowing us to deliver the best plane for the president at the best value for the American taxpayer. ” An Air Force official, not authorized to speak publicly about the program, said that the current plane will be 30 years old next year, and the new ones aren’t slated to come online until the  . By then the technology aboard the current plane will be dated and it will become increasingly hard to maintain it. Any delays to replace it could cause significant problems, the official said.    Air Force One. (Carsten   Images)  Richard Aboulafia, an aerospace analyst with the Teal Group, said Trump’s tweet was “completely nonsensical and based on exactly nothing. But it’s very difficult to adjudicate on complicated program management and military requirements questions with Twitter as your medium. ” Loren Thompson, a defense consultant, said that “Air Force One has unique communications, safety and   features so that the president can function under the most trying circumstances  —   like nuclear war. ” The price tag, he said, “is driven by the demands of the mission. ” Boeing is under contract to build two planes to serve as Air Force One. “I think once [Trump] sees an actual Air Force One and the unique capabilities it is outfitted with he may start to understand why it is so expensive to replace,” Harrison said. Air Force One is a symbol of presidential power at home and abroad, servicing under the call sign “Air Force One” when the president is on board. But it is also a “flying command post,” as Harrison said. “In the event of a nuclear attack, this is where the military will keep the president safe,” he said. Trump’s tweet was reminiscent of when Sen. John McCain took aim at the fleet of presidential helicopters at the beginning of the Obama administration, saying in 2009, “I don’t think that there’s any more graphic demonstration of how good ideas have cost taxpayers an enormous amount of money. ”  President Obama, then just a few weeks in office, said the fleet was “an example of the procurement process gone amok” leading defense officials to kill the program outright and then restart the procurement process. By then, the helicopter program was well underway and did have significant problems. But Air Force One is different, Harrison said, because “it’s still very, very early. It hasn’t had a chance to have any cost overruns yet. ” He said it was curious that Trump would single out Air Force One when there are so many other defense programs that have gone wildly over budget and behind schedule. But this isn’t the first time Trump has highlighted the costs of Air Force One. In July, he objected to the use of the plane for campaign events: “Taxpayers are paying a fortune for the use of Air Force One on the campaign trail by President Obama and Crooked Hillary,” he tweeted. “A total disgrace!” He brought it up again at a rally in North Carolina in July. “Now Air Force One is a very old Boeing 747,” Trump said. “It sucks up a lot of gas. A lot of fuel. Boy, the fuel bill. You turn on those engines, I can tell you, it’s a lot of money. ” Trump reported owning between $50, 001 and $100, 000 in Boeing stock in his most recent financial disclosure, which was filed in May 2016 and disclosed his 2015 holdings. He sold the shares in June, according to his spokesman. Boeing’s stock was down 0. 64 percent in morning trading. Jenna Johnson contributed to this report.

","This post has been updated. Shares of stock in aircraft manufacturer Boeing fell nearly $2 a share before markets opened on Tuesday.     The reason? A tweet from the  .   Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!  —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 6, 2016   Were Boeing to lose a $4 billion contract, that would certainly cause people to be skeptical of future earnings. But this, as seems always to be the case with Donald Trump tweets, is not the full story. As our Christian Davenport reports, the contract with Boeing is currently $170 million. The government’s plan to replace Air Force One actually involves two different planes which would serve future presidents for years to come. Boeing won the contract in 2015; the new planes are expected to be operational in about a decade. The $170 million isn’t for manufacturing, after all. It’s for Boeing’s work ”determin[ing] the capabilities” of the planes they will eventually produce. It was natural to wonder, given the apparently unprompted nature of Trump’s tweet, if part of his comment was meant to suggest he would prefer to use his existing aircraft for the job of the presidency. His campaign spent $6. 7 million on his personal aircraft after he announced his candidacy, and he has called Air Force One ”a step down” from his personal aircraft ”in every way.” (Not size, mind you.) Once Trump received a Secret Service detail, the agency paid $1. 6 million for its agents to travel with him    money that went to TAG Air, a company owned by Trump.         Trump’s current plane is also a Boeing. The Air Force wouldn’t let Trump keep using his plane as president, though, unless it were significantly upgraded. As CNN reported earlier this month, Trump’s personal plane would need to be upgraded with critical functionality to serve as his official aircraft. That includes missile detection and avoidance systems, electromagnetic shielding,   refueling mechanisms and confidential communications systems. The cost of those upgrades would be up to Trump. As it turns out, though, the Trump tweet may not have been unprompted. CNN’s Jake Tapper noted on Twitter that shortly before the tweet (which was posted at 8:52 a. m. Eastern) the Chicago Tribune posted an article quoting the company’s CEO, Dennis Muilenberg. (The comments were made at a speech on Friday, not in an interview with the Tribune, as this article originally indicated.) ”Anyone who paid attention to the recent campaigns and the election results realizes that one of the overarching themes was apprehension about free and fair trade,” Muilenberg said at the Illinois Manufacturing Association last week, as noted by Tribune columnist Robert Reed. Fair trade has helped Boeing, which prides itself on being America’s largest manufacturing exporter. ”Last year, we delivered 495 737s from our factory in Renton, Wash. to customers around the world,” Muilenberg continued, noting that a third of the planes were sent to China. ”This phenomenon would have been unimaginable when I started at the company in 1985.” Those are pointed comments. It was Trump, of course, who robustly criticized free trade during the general election. And it is Trump who, this week, seemed to threaten a trade war with China.      Shortly after tweeting that Boeing’s contract to build the next Air Force One should be canceled, Dec. 6,   Trump told reporters in the lobby of Trump Tower he wants the company ”to make a lot of money but not that much money.” (The Washington Post)   That story has a dateline of 7:30 Central time    8:30 Eastern. Trump’s tweet came out a few minutes later. We don’t know that Trump was responding to the Tribune story. We do know that the last time he tweeted an     opinion, about   it was immediately after a Fox News segment showing students burning flags. We also know that Trump’s tweet tanked Boeing’s stock price, albeit only briefly. In 2013, Trump tweeted about having just bought stock in Boeing (”great company! ”) but his spokesman said on Tuesday that the   no longer holds stock in Boeing, or anything else, having sold it all in June. The fluctuations in Boeing’s stock price that may have stemmed from Trump’s annoyance at a news article criticizing his policies in the lightest of terms, then, only affected other people. Update: Some good news for shareholders: Boeing’s stock ended the day up slightly."

","         “Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!”  —   Donald Trump, in a tweet, Dec. 6, 2016   Donald Trump targeted Boeing in a tweet, accusing it of letting costs go out of control in the building of a new Air Force One jet.   Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!  —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 6, 2016   Trump is not a stickler for accuracy, but there are number of inaccuracies in his tweet. Let’s break them down one by one. “Boeing is building . . . ” Earlier in 2016, Boeing received a $170 million contract to design a replacement for the aging pair of Air Force Ones used by the president. Boeing is not actually building the jet, though logically it is the only U. S. manufacturer with the capability to build such an aircraft. “   …     a brand new 747 Air Force One   …     ” At a minimum, there would be two Air Force Ones. You need a spare in case there is a problem with one. The jets generally have a life cycle of 30 years. A plane only receives the call sign “Air Force One” when the president is on board. This is actually a highly modified version of the Boeing   jet. “Costs are out of control, more than $4 billion” Cost have actually not been set. The Defense Department’s   plan indicates a cost of $2. 9 billion over the next five years for design and development. It’s logical to assume at least another $1 billion in additional expenses to complete and procure the aircraft. So an estimate of $4 billion  —   for design, testing and manufacture of at least two jets  —   is not completely out of line. But the budget is subject to approval by Congress and the actual design of the aircraft. Boeing literally needs to   the plane from the ground up, so there are many   expenses. Air Force One needs to be designed to survive a nuclear war. It requires all sorts of undisclosed security upgrades and countermeasures. It can refuel in flight. The actual cost of the plane will depend on the equipment that goes into it. There also needs to be extensive testing, probably lasting two years, before the plane is deemed ready for presidential travel. Congress obviously would have a say in the final price tag. The Boeing 757 jet used by the secretary of state was supposed to get   engines but at the last moment, they were killed by  . Ted Stevens ( ). This resulted in some cost savings  —   and also that the secretary of state would always have to refuel in Alaska on flights to and from Asia. Boeing says it made no money making the last set of Air Force One jets and does not expect to make money on this order, as it is more a matter of prestige. “Cancel the order!” Nothing has been ordered yet. But the program could be eliminated. This may not be a problem for Trump, but certainly would affect his successors. The current aircraft were delivered in 1990, and as we noted, the life cycle is about 30 years. The Pentagon says the current fleet “faces capability gaps, rising maintenance costs, and parts obsolescence as it reaches the end of its planned    . ” Todd Harrison, a defense budget expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said “the program is very new and hardly had a chance to get started yet. ” So, in effect, there are no real cost overruns yet. He added that the estimated $4 billion cost is reasonable given the requirements of the project.

142091,217460,He ‘lied his a– off’: Carrier union leader on Trump’s big deal,Washington Post,Danielle Paquette,2016-12-06,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161207004552/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/12/06/he-got-up-there-and-lied-his-a-off-carrier-union-leader-on-trumps-big-deal/
","     The Secret Service agents told the Carrier workers to stay put, so Chuck Jones sat in the factory conference room for nearly three hours, waiting for   Donald Trump. He’d grown used to this suspense.  Seven months earlier, at a campaign rally in Indianapolis, Trump had pledged to save the plant’s jobs, most of which were slated to move to Mexico. Then the businessman won the election, and the 1, 350 workers whose paychecks were on the line wondered if he’d keep his promise. Jones, president of the United Steelworkers 1999, which represents Carrier employees, felt optimistic when Trump announced last week that he’d reached a deal with the factory’s parent company, United Technologies, to preserve 1, 100 of the Indianapolis jobs  —   until the union leader heard from Carrier that only 730 of the production jobs would stay and 550 of his members would lose their livelihoods, after all.   At the Dec. 1 meeting, where Trump was supposed to lay out the details, Jones hoped he would explain himself. “But he got up there,” Jones said Tuesday, “and, for whatever reason, lied his    off. ” In front of a crowd of about 150 supervisors, production workers and reporters, Trump praised Carrier and its parent company, United Technologies. ”Now they’re keeping  —   actually the number’s over 1, 100 people,” he said, “which is so great. ” Jones wondered why the   appeared to be inflating the victory. Trump and Pence, he said, could take credit for rescuing 800 of the Carrier jobs, including   positions.      The Post’s Fact Checker took a closer look at the claims   Donald Trump made during a speech in Indiana on Dec. 1, about the deal to keep jobs at a Carrier plant there that were due to be shipped to Mexico. (Jenny   Washington Post)   Of the nearly 1, 700 workers at the Indianapolis plant, however, 350 in research and development were never scheduled to leave, Jones said. Another 80 jobs, which Trump seemed to include in his figure, were   clerical and supervisory positions. (A Carrier spokesperson confirmed that 800 factory jobs once earmarked for Mexico are staying.) And now the   was applauding the company and giving it millions of dollars in tax breaks, even as hundreds of Indianapolis workers prepared to be laid off. “Trump and Pence, they pulled a dog and pony show on the numbers,” said Jones, who voted for Hillary Clinton but called her ”the better of two evils.” “I almost threw up in my mouth. ” Spokespeople for Trump did not respond to the Post’s request for comment.  In exchange for downsizing its move south of the border, United Technologies would receive $7 million in tax credits from Indiana, to be paid in $700, 000 installments each year for a decade. Carrier, meanwhile, agreed to invest $16 million in its Indiana operation. United Technologies still plans to send 700 factory jobs from Huntington, Ind, to Monterrey, Mexico.  T. J. Bray, 32, one of the workers who will keep his job, sat in the front row during the Dec. 1 meeting as Trump spoke. A corporate employee had guided him specifically to that seat, he said, so he suspected he might be part of Trump’s remarks.   On Carrier’s makeshift stage, Trump paraphrased the words of an unnamed Carrier employee who talked to an NBC reporter after the election. Bray was the only Carrier employee who had appeared on television that day. Apparently, he realized, Trump was saying he inspired the deal.      Speaking at the Carrier plant in Indianapolis, Dec. 1,   Donald Trump said he decided to call the company so it would not ship jobs abroad after watching a television news report about the factory. (The Washington Post)   “He said something to the effect, ‘No, we’re not leaving, because Donald Trump promised us that we’re not leaving,’ and I never thought I made that promise,” Trump said. “Not with Carrier. I made it for everybody else. I didn’t make it really for Carrier. ” In fact, Trump did make that commitment, and it’s on video.   ”They’re going to call me and they are going to say ’Mr. President, Carrier has decided to stay in Indiana,’” Trump had said at the April rally. ”One hundred percent    that’s what is going to happen.” Last week, though, the   told the Carrier crowd he hadn’t meant that literally. “I was talking about Carrier like all other companies from here on in,” Trump said. ”Because they made the decision a year and a half ago. But he believed that was  —   and I could understand it. I actually said  —   I didn’t make it  —   when they played that, I said, ’I did make it, but I didn’t mean it quite that way. ’” Trump asked if the employee he’d been referencing was in the audience. A woman yelled that her son was, and Trump began to compliment that son, though he hadn’t spoken in the television news segment. (Bray said that a United Technologies spokesperson later told him Trump meant to single him out.) “I was confused when he was like, ‘I wasn’t talking about Carrier,’” Bray said. “You made this whole campaign about Carrier, and we’re still losing a lot of jobs. ” Bray clapped that day, anyway, for the 800 that would remain on American soil.  *This story has been updated More on Wonkblog: After Trump pledged to keep Carrier jobs in U.

142092,217461,"In West Virginia coal country, voters are ‘thrilled’ about Donald Trump",Washington Post,Marc Fisher,2016-12-06,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161207004552/https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/in-west-virginia-coal-country-voters-are-thrilled-about-donald-trump/2016/12/06/8eb0b0ca-b8c2-11e6-b994-f45a208f7a73_story.html
","  BUCKHANNON, W. Va.  —   Bill Nesselrotte owns a coal company that doesn’t mine coal anymore. Still, a few days each week, he straps on a backpack and pushes through the brush to collect jars of water from streams, ponds, wells and springs  —   samples to prove to the government that he’s not a polluter.  There has been no drilling, no blasting for more than two years on the 150 acres Nesselrotte leases here  —   not since the bottom dropped out of a market that once provided a good livelihood for him and a couple dozen other people in West Virginia’s dramatically narrow valleys. These days, his mine is nothing but a   business, selling limestone to anyone who shows up with a dump truck, $150 a load, barely enough to keep one man employed. But to keep crushing rocks, Nesselrotte must keep his coal permits active, and that means collecting water samples, 48 trips a month. A slew of other new rules keeps him at his   table, slaving over paperwork deep into the night. Such burdens are, he says, a major reason 76 percent of Upshur County voters last month put their trust in the man who promised to slash government regulations and bring back coal  —   Donald Trump. Coal country offers a counterweight to the palpable anxiety about Trump in some parts of the country. Here, people said they are “euphoric” and “thrilled” about the incoming president, even in the valley where Nesselrotte has no customers for his coal. That optimism is pervasive even after Trump last week chose as his commerce secretary Wilbur Ross, the Manhattan billionaire who in 2006 owned the mine just down the hill, where an underground explosion killed 12 miners, the region’s worst coal disaster in decades. “West Virginians are realists,” said Nesselrotte, a mining engineer by education and a serial entrepreneur by virtue of living in a place that still depends on coal, even though nearly every mine within an hour’s drive has closed in recent years. “The mines have been shut down, the railroads have been torn up, the preparation plants have closed. A lot of stuff has been done that can’t be undone.   A load of black locust logs, used for fence posts, rolls through town in Buckhannon, W. Va. (Jeff   The Washington Post)  “But I’m really looking forward to this president,” he said. “It’s kind of refreshing to see people come into government who know how business works. ” Still, for some, especially for families who felt the mine disaster firsthand, the naming of Ross has dulled the thrill of Trump’s victory. “I don’t like that choice,” Vickie Boni, 74, said. “I always felt the company was responsible. ” Boni’s   John Boni, was the fire boss, in charge of checking safety at the Sago Mine. Five days before the explosion, he alerted superiors to a leak of dangerous methane gas. A freak lightning strike ignited the methane, investigators later said. Right after the explosion, John Boni retired, after 36 years in the mines. A few months later, he put a bullet in his head. Still, Vickie Boni remains optimistic that Trump will live up to his promise to restore coal jobs. “That’s people’s livelihoods,” she said. Her father went into the mines at 14 and was killed in a mine at 44. Her son might have ended up mining, too, but there was no work, so he moved to North Carolina, a story that many older parents here tell about their   children. Ross did not respond to a request for comment about the Sago disaster. An inveterate buyer of deeply troubled companies, he had bought the mine only a couple of months before the explosion and was not   when the men were killed. In a televised interview in 2006, soon after the tragedy, Ross told ABC that he knew the mine had been cited with 208 violations, that he accepted responsibility for the disaster, that he had not made a personal contribution toward a fund for the miners’ families, and that his company “never scrimped on safety expenditures. ” Several investigations concluded that the mine’s owner, International Coal Group, was responsible for the safety violations, but that the violations did not cause the explosion. Only one miner who was trapped survived.   A limestone pond on Bill Nesselrotte’s mine. The mining operation now sells crushed limestone instead of coal. (Jeff   The Washington Post)  Helen Winans’s son Marshall died at Sago, and although she blames the company for what happened, she does not see Ross as culpable. “It wasn’t his fault,” she said, “it was the people here. People went into the mine unprotected because they’d been drinking. The company should have had better safety, and the inspectors should have the sense to shut them down and slap fines on them, but it’s dangerous work. ” Dangerous, but essential, she said: Before the price of coal collapsed, before the number of working miners in the state fell to a   low of 15, 000, miners could make $60, 000, even $75, 000 a year, without a high school education. Walmart money doesn’t come close. Winans, 85, lost one son in the mine and another on a gas drilling rig. Her husband died of black lung disease after a life in the mines. Eighteen years later, Winans still hasn’t remarried because marriage would end her black lung benefits. “The government makes you live in sin,” she said. She’s lived with a man for years, always feeling a bit guilty about it, “but I’m not giving up that money for a piece of paper that says ‘I do.’ ” Despite the tragedies that have marked her life, Winans prays for the return of coal, and she says Trump will make it happen. “I like the way he talks  —   straight,” she said, “not like that Hillary [Clinton] the way she got up there and shook her finger and said she’d shut every mine down. What would that do to West Virginia?” (In March, the Democratic presidential candidate had said in a CNN town hall that “we’re going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business, right? . . . Now we’ve got to move away from coal and all the other fossil fuels. ”) Trump’s appeal here is stylistic as well as   said David McCauley, the mayor of Buckhannon, the county seat, a pretty and bustling town of 5, 700. It’s about coal, but also about being ornery and oppositional. “Trump was just what people here have always been  —   skeptical of government, almost libertarian,” McCauley said. “He’s a West Virginia pipe dream: He’s going to undo the damage to the coal industry and bring back the jobs, and all of our kids down there in North Carolina are going to come home. ” McCauley, who is also a professor at West Virginia Wesleyan College, one of the town’s biggest employers, was taken aback when Trump named Ross. “The whole history of West Virginia is exploitation by outside influences,” he said. “Now the guy 80 percent of us voted for turns around and nominates one of the least favorite names in Upshur County. If he brings in more billionaires and Mitt Romney is secretary of state, people will say, ‘Well, wait a minute now.’ But if the economy turns around, he’ll get the credit. ” McCauley, 58, is a Republican but not a Trumpian. He was a Jeb Bush delegate and ended up voting for Clinton “because the last thing we need is two or three more Antonin Scalias” on the Supreme Court. Like many here, he doesn’t fit neatly into Clinton’s “basket of deplorables. ” He’s   rights,   marriage, he said, “a fervent      guy, a social progressive. ” But McCauley is a Republican because government seemed too big and intrusive, and because, as he put it, “you could not move to Buckhannon and settle into a public position without being a Republican. I can do my job better when people say, ‘He’s one of us.’ ” West Virginia’s Democratic roots are obvious, even though the state hasn’t voted blue in a presidential race since 1996. Upshur County’s delegate to the state legislature, Bill Hamilton, calls himself “an oxymoron Republican,” because he’s closely bound to the unions. Like many here, his skepticism of the big businesses that own many mines sits deep in his bones, and the Sago disaster only cemented that doubt. One miner who was killed was Hamilton’s client at his insurance agency, another was his lockermate from junior high school and a third was a family acquaintance. Hamilton never worked in the mines, warned away by his father, who toiled underground until he was drafted to fight in World War II, and who lost two brothers to mining. Still, he finds himself fervently hoping Trump will reopen the coal fields and invest in technology to diminish the environmental damage. Coal, he said, remains the state’s lifeline. But although Hamilton came around to Trump after initially supporting Ohio Gov. John Kasich, he wonders if the selection of Ross means Trump might not really be a friend to miners. Hamilton has been pushing Congress to pass a bill to preserve pension benefits that thousands of miners are set to lose next year because so many coal companies have gone belly up. “Ross bought companies and then severed the benefits to make more profit,” Hamilton said. “So do you think that bill’s going to go anywhere now?” Thomas Toler remains “euphoric” about the Trump win and the prospect of a coal revival. Toler’s uncle was killed in the Sago disaster; the two had worked together in the mines for years. Thomas could never go back underground after the trauma: “It was survivor’s guilt, and just not being able to be there with him. ” But the tragedy made Toler, 55, no less devoted to the industry that defines his family and his community, and he said he misses the mines every day. “It’s your parents’ and your grandparents’ and your life,” he said. “You just accept the risk, just like driving an automobile or playing football. You have to live. And my uncle, like me, loved it more than anything. If you have a curious mind or any interest in geology, you’re setting foot every day where no man has ever set foot before. ” Toler said his hopes now are bound up in Trump’s presidency. “I guess I really want to believe it’s really going to be different,” he said. The shuttered Sago Mine is now a gentle, grassy hillside marked only by a   fence. Up the hill, Nesselrotte would like to restore a similarly green cover to the barren rock of his idled surface mine, as he has done at nine other locations through the years. “All my other mines, you can’t even tell it was ever mined,” he said. “This one, I’m ashamed of. ” But Nesselrotte cannot afford to plant trees at the site, an open wound of brown and gray threaded with black veins of   coal. And he would like to finish mining it first. So he waits, selling the occasional load of rocks, hoping to drill again and to bring back the workers he had to lay off. “I’m realistic. I know Trump will have to compromise,” Nesselrotte said. But he was “tickled to death” last week when Trump announced a deal in which Carrier, the   and heating company, will keep about a thousand jobs in Indiana instead of moving them to Mexico. “And he’s not even in authority yet,” Nesselrotte marveled. “I’m thinking we could be back in business. ” "
142093,217462,Trump announces Japanese corporate giant is investing $50 billion in the U.S.,Washington Post,Ana Swanson,2016-12-06,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161207004552/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/12/06/trump-announces-japanese-bank-investing-50-billion-in-the-united-states/
","           Donald Trump announced Tuesday that Japanese telecom and internet conglomerate SoftBank would invest $50 billion in the United States and create 50, 000 new jobs, saying that the decision wouldn’t have been made without Trump’s election win. Trump appeared in the lobby of the Trump Tower on Tuesday with Masayoshi Son, the chief executive of SoftBank, to announce the news, and later on Twitter claimed credit.   Masa said he would never do this had we (Trump) not won the election!  —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 6, 2016   It was not immediately clear how much of the investment was new, or how much would come directly from SoftBank itself. Son told The Wall Street Journal in an interview that the money would come from a $100 billion joint investment fund announced in October by SoftBank and the Saudi Arabian government to invest in the global technology sector. SoftBank has said it would provide at least $25 billion for the fund in the next five years, while Saudi Arabia’s public investment fund pledged to invest up to $45 billion in the same time period. The additional $30 billion would come from outside investors. During a trip to India last week, Son said he was close to securing the remaining funds. Although Trump claimed credit for the investment, Roger Entner, an analyst at Recon Analytics, argued that much of the $50 billion may have already been destined for U. S. technology companies. ”I think it’s making hay out of something that was there already,” said Entner. ”In all likelihood, this comes out of the $100 billion fund. Considering the extremely large part that the U. S. has in the   economy, [Son] would have probably invested something in the neighborhood anyway.” Son told reporters at Trump Tower that the funds would be invested into American  . As he spoke, Son brandished a piece of paper with the same figures that Trump had announced. The paper appeared to specify that the investment would be made in the next four years. The paper also contained the logo of Foxconn, a major supplier for Apple’s iPhones. It was not immediately clear what role Foxconn would play in the deal, but analysts speculated the company could be responsible for the additional $7 billion in investment and 50, 000 new jobs listed on the paper. Foxconn could not be reached for comment. ”Seven billion [U. S. dollars] could mean that they’re going to build a factory or multiple factories in the U. S. to assemble phones. We don’t know that, but that would be the speculation,” says Entner.    Son holds a paper with details of SoftBank’s $50 billion investment, announced Tuesday, Dec. 6. The Washington Post  Trump also tweeted the news Tuesday afternoon.   Masa (SoftBank) of Japan has agreed to invest $50 billion in the U. S. toward businesses and 50, 000 new jobs. ...  —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 6, 2016   Softbank owns roughly 80 percent of telecom company Sprint. Following the announcement, shares of Sprint Corp surged nearly 4 percent as of  . The announcement also raised suppositions that Son might be seeking to curry favor for his U. S. business interests. Sprint and SoftBank abandoned an effort to purchase rival telecom carrier   in 2014 after U. S. regulators signaled the deal might violate   laws. But in August, Bloomberg quoted people familiar with his thinking as saying that Son still held out hope for the merger. A Trump administration could consider a potential merger between Sprint and   differently, analysts said. Speaking from the lobby of the Trump tower, Son said that he wanted to celebrate Trump’s election “because he would do a lot of deregulation. ” Jeff Kagan, an   telecom industry analyst, said Son could be courting Trump to improve the chances of the merger, but he also described Son as an ambitious entrepreneur who was likely looking for further opportunities. ”Maybe he sees there’s a different possibility for a Sprint and   partnership. But that’s only one slice of the pie. I don’t think Masayoshi Son is that small of a thinker,” said Kagan. ”He sees opportunities, based on what we’ve all seen happen in the last few weeks. And he wants to be a player.” A   billionaire, Son has earned a reputation as somewhat of a maverick. Since founding SoftBank in 1981, he has built the company into a telecom, internet and financial leviathan with purchases including an early investment in Chinese   giant Alibaba and the acquisition of the Japanese unit of British mobile phone company Vodafone. SoftBank also led a $1 billion investment round in online lender Social Finance Inc last year. In November, a meeting between Trump, his daughter Ivanka and the Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe raised controversy over potential conflicts of interest between a Trump presidency and his businesses. Ivanka has been appointed to take charge of Trump’s businesses during his time in office, which include a chain of international hotels."

"," Is America becoming a rogue state?  The State Department stopped using the term years ago to describe the likes of Iran and North Korea, figuring it was needlessly provocative. But it would seem the incoming Trump administration plans to handle its affairs  —   domestic and foreign  —   in a manner that meets the dictionary definition of a “rogue state” as one “that conducts its policy in a dangerously unpredictable way. ” Even before Donald Trump threw   relations into a new round of turmoil by speaking with the Taiwanese leader and by trolling a nation of 1. 4 billion people on Twitter, Trump and his team set off new chaos between   India and Pakistan, with Trump praising the repressive regime of the latter and pledging to visit, while a member of his transition team told the former that Trump supports designating Pakistan a terrorist haven.  Trump snubbed our closest ally, Britain, by having   calls with nine foreign leaders before granting British Prime Minister Theresa May the honor. He shattered protocol by suggesting Britain name Nigel Farage, the Brexit leader, ambassador to the United States. Meanwhile, NATO leaders meeting in Brussels this week were on edge about Trump’s coziness with Russia and his dismissive words about the alliance. According to foreign government accounts, Trump praised Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte’s campaign against drug users and dealers, which has killed at least 4, 500 people in five months. And he hailed Kazakhstan dictator Nursultan Nazarbayev  for his “fantastic success” that can be called a “miracle. ”      The Washington Post’s Jia Lynn Yang explains the back story on relations between the U. S. China and Taiwan and the ramifications of Friday’s telephone call between   Donald Trump and Taiwanese President Tsai  . (Alice Li, Victoria   Washington Post)   Jittery world leaders are unlikely to be reassured to learn that the man Trump tapped to run the Pentagon goes by the nickname “Mad Dog. ” The domestic picture is no less chaotic. Trump is now open to keeping the Paris climate pact, after calling climate change a hoax. He campaigned against Goldman Sachs as a symbol of corruption and is now stocking his administration with Goldman bankers. He pledged to reinstate waterboarding and to repeal Obamacare but is rethinking both. He riled supporters with a pledge to prosecute and imprison Hillary Clinton but has reconsidered. He dropped his pledge to ban Muslims or those from   countries from entering America in favor of better vetting of all immigrants. He now says his border wall may be a fence in parts, and he dropped his talk of mass deportation of illegal immigrants.  His nominee to be commerce secretary assures Americans that “tariffs are the last thing” to which the Trump administration would resort  —   only to be contradicted by Trump himself, who tweeted Sunday that here will “soon” be a 35 percent tariff on imports from companies that offshore jobs.  But for all the promises Trump is breaking, there is one he has kept without wavering: his vow to be unpredictable. “We must as a nation be more unpredictable,” he said this year. “We have to be unpredictable, and we have to be unpredictable starting now. ”  Some suggest that there is a method to Trump’s madness, that he is trying to make   adversaries think he is irrational and capricious, thereby making foes and rivals wary of pushing him too far. This is why North Korea’s Kim Jong Un gets a wide berth. On a lesser scale, this also underpinned Richard Nixon’s “Madman Theory” during the Vietnam War: If he appeared to be crazy enough to use nuclear weapons, the theory went, North Vietnam and the Soviet Union might back down.  But in Trump’s application of the Madman Theory there seems to be less theory than madman. There may be advantages to keeping foes and opponents off guard, but Trump is baffling friends and allies, too. In foreign affairs, unpredictability spooks allies and spreads instability. And unpredictable policy at home has long been seen as toxic for business. For these reasons, George W. Bush made predictable leadership a matter of pride. When I covered his White House 16 years ago, I found that the best way to predict Bush’s actions was to listen to his words: He did exactly what he said he would do. Many didn’t like the result, but Bush made it easy for Republicans in Congress to follow his lead. Now, Trump’s uncertain trumpet is having the opposite effect. The corporate welfare offered to Carrier’s parent company to keep jobs in the United States has some previously supportive conservatives complaining about crony capitalism. His revived talk of high tariffs on imports has GOP congressional leaders worried about a trade war. On his decision to speak with the Taiwanese leader, Trump’s   defenders were split: Was it a meaningless courtesy, as some Trump advisers said? Or a    shift in U. S. policy, as others claimed? The widespread chaos suggests Trump isn’t signaling new policies as much as he’s winging it. His unpredictability is not a theory. It’s the absence of one.

","   Jeremy   is president of J Street, a   organization that advocates a diplomatic resolution to the   conflict.     In recent days, attacks on Rep. Keith Ellison ( .) over his attitudes toward Jews and Israel have picked up steam. Running for chairmanship of the Democratic National Committee, Ellison is but the latest public figure with   views that depart from the hawkish dogma of the traditional   establishment to find his personal credibility and qualification for high office under fire. Let’s be clear: Like all of us, Ellison has made mistakes for which he has apologized. But if the goal of   advocacy is to educate and change minds, then wouldn’t it be cause for celebration that a public figure who at one time defended the Nation of Islam has come to believe in the state of Israel’s right to exist and defend itself? I personally have talked at length with Ellison about Israel and the Middle East. I’ve traveled with him to the region, where we met Israeli and Palestinian officials, activists and civilians. I  —   and all those who’ve taken the time to get to know him  —   have always found him to be deeply thoughtful and  . While my organization and I do not comment on internal Democratic deliberations and make no endorsement for the position of chair, it is absolutely clear that Ellison is qualified for the position and, like other candidates, worthy of serious consideration.  He is a strong supporter of the   solution, believing both the Palestinian and the Jewish people have the right to  . He believes concessions and compromise on sensitive issues are the only way to bring a peaceful end to the   conflict and secure Israel’s future as a Jewish and democratic state. These views are entirely consistent with those of the large majority of Jewish Americans and, in fact, a great deal of the Israeli security establishment. Like him, they oppose actions by both sides, such as settlement expansion and incitement to violence, that make resolving the conflict more difficult. Like him, they support the Iran nuclear agreement for its success in defanging Iran’s nuclear program through diplomacy, without firing a shot. Unfortunately, some American Jewish leaders choose to define “ ” not in terms of one’s concern for Israel’s future, but by lockstep adherence to the positions taken by the sitting Israeli government. For years, there have been efforts to silence or delegitimize voices in our politics and our community who speak out about the strategic and moral dangers of the ongoing occupation of the West Bank, its devastating impact on Palestinians and its dangerous implications for the country going forward. Rather than engage in meaningful and substantive debate, some of these voices prefer to simply label those with whom they disagree as “” or even worse, “ . ” As in Ellison’s case, they unearth regrettable or poorly chosen words uttered years ago, take them out of context and use them as a weapon. These tactics greatly hurt our national discourse on Israel and the Middle East. They limit open and honest debate over the best ways to help Israelis and Palestinians advance peace and democracy in the region. They force to the sidelines or silence many with critical views. They create the false impression that American Jews are monolithically hawkish, and that we applaud and endorse shortsighted and   policies advanced by the current Israeli government. Moreover, at a time when incidents of genuine   and xenophobic hatred are on the rise across the country and white nationalists are crawling out from under their rocks  —   with cover from some aides to the    —   campaigns such as the one directed at Ellison shamefully misdirect ire toward people who agree with the Jewish community’s values of tolerance and respect. Recent polling makes clear that Ellison represents the policy views of the significant majority of Democrats and of Jewish Americans. Leaders with similar views and values are going to be the future of the Democratic Party, of our country and of the American Jewish community. It is time for those who disagree to halt the personal attacks and smears. These tactics do not win friends for the Jewish community or help ensure that American policy will be   in the long run. Frankly, they may have the opposite effect. Enough is enough. Disagreements over policy should be welcome and encouraged in a healthy democracy.

"," Whatever else future historians say about Donald Trump’s early foreign policy moves, they’re likely to note the erratic and, in many ways,   nature of the  ’s initial dealings with China, the country many analysts view as the United States’ most important   rival. Devising a wise strategy for challenging China’s ascendancy in Asia is arguably the top foreign policy task for a new president. But if Trump planned to take a tougher stance, this was a haphazard way to do it. The   instead stumbled into a   foreign flap, insulting Beijing and causing it to lose face, without having a clear,   plan for what he seeks to accomplish.  Worse, Trump’s fulminations about China come just as his plan to withdraw from the   Partnership is undermining the United States’ standing with allies in Asia. Trump, in effect, is ceding economic ground to China at the very moment he claims to be taking a harder line. Is this a cool, calculating strategy from the dealmaker? It looks to me more like a hot mess.   Trump’s phone call Friday with Taiwan’s president needn’t have created this crisis. The Chinese at first seemed willing to give the inexperienced Trump a pass  —   blaming the   call on “petty” maneuvering by Taipei. Beijing presumably recognized that this wasn’t the time to pick a fight, and Trump should have adopted the same stance.  But Trump, evidently feeling cornered, doubled down. He unleashed a Twitter storm about China’s currency manipulation (a largely bogus charge he repeated through the campaign) and its aggressive actions in the South China Sea (a real problem requiring strong, steady U. S. leadership). An embarrassed China is sure to take countermeasures, which will further confound U. S. policy.         The episode reinforced two points about Trump: He loves to be flattered by calls from foreign leaders (including “presidents” of countries the United States doesn’t recognize). And he’s   and reacts to criticism with the pique of an American Kim Jong Un.  Twitter amplifies Trump’s tendency for personal overreaction. In an era of nuclear weapons, this sort of undamped presidential oscillation could be seriously dangerous to global health.  To understand this China flap, try imagining it through the eyes of Henry Kissinger, the former secretary of state who created the template for modern U. S.  relations. On Friday, he was in Beijing saying soothing things about Trump; a few hours later, the   threw a stink bomb into the edifice Kissinger started building 45 years ago.   President Xi Jinping had welcomed Kissinger on Friday as a potential intermediary with Trump. “We are now in a key moment,” Xi said. “Dr. Kissinger, I am all ears to what you have to say about the current world situation and the future growth of  . S. relations. ”  Kissinger suggested that Trump, despite his inexperience, would be pragmatic. After his meeting with Xi, he told CNN’s Fareed Zakaria, “This   it’s the most unique that I’ve experienced in one respect: He has absolutely no baggage. ” He argued that despite Trump’s inflammatory campaign positions, analysts “should not insist in nailing him to positions that he had taken in the campaign on which he doesn’t insist. ”  Then  —   kaboom!  —   the Taiwan call, which raised questions about the durability of Kissinger’s 1972 Shanghai Communique that set the basic framework of the “One China” policy. This jousting over Taiwan wouldn’t be so worrisome if other aspects of the U. S.  policy were intact. But Trump’s pledge to tear up the TPP in his first days in office has sent the other 11 nations that signed the pact scrambling for cover  —   with some talking of making new deals with a Beijing that is eager to fill the void.  Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, the United States’ most important Asian ally, said last month that TPP members would consider joining a rival,   trade agreement known as the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, or RCEP. “There’s no doubt that there would be a pivot to the RCEP if the TPP doesn’t go forward,” Abe said. Peru and Australia, two other TPP signatories, also indicated they might join the RCEP. “If you want to stand up to China, the last thing you should do is walk away from TPP,” said Michael Froman in an interview. He’s the U. S. trade representative Trump blasted during the campaign as an incompetent negotiator.  It must be said that Trump’s slapdash,   Asian maneuvers over the past week make Froman look like a negotiating genius by comparison. Trump just faced his first foreign policy test with the Taiwan flap and muffed it. Let’s hope he learns something.

142097,217467,How Trump should renegotiate the Iran deal,Washington Post,Joseph I.

","   Joseph I. Lieberman, a former U. S. senator from Connecticut, is chairman of United Against Nuclear Iran. Mark D. Wallace, a former U. S. ambassador to the United Nations for management and reform, is chief executive of United Against Nuclear Iran.     Like   Donald Trump, we vigorously opposed the Iran nuclear agreement, so we sympathize with his promise to “dismantle” it. But we hope that he and his administration will first try to aggressively enforce and then renegotiate the deal beyond the confines of the nuclear issue to make it better for us and the world. Before such renegotiations begin, the Trump administration could strengthen its hand by closely consulting with our allies in Iran’s neighborhood  —   Israel and the Arab states. They were missing from the group that developed and consented to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) as the agreement is formally known. That was wrong, for two main reasons: because the Arab states and Israel are our allies and the Iranians are not, and because the countries in the region have the greatest equities at stake and should have a significant voice in the outcome. To date, the Iranian regime has made clear it has no intent to honor the spirit or letter of the JCPOA. Iran’s pattern of reckless behavior has accelerated over the past year. Its     and   rhetoric has grown stronger, and its actions have matched its rhetoric. Last month, 11 Arab states publicly accused Iran before the United Nations of meddling in their internal affairs. In June, the State Department again designated Iran the world’s leading state sponsor of terrorism.     President Obama said the Iran deal is an example of the gap between rhetoric and reality during a news conference Monday, Nov. 14. (The Washington Post)   The American people see clearly what is happening. According to a recent survey by United Against Nuclear Iran, a large majority of American registered voters view Iran as the greatest state threat facing the United States  —   ahead of North Korea, Russia and China. Only the Islamic State and   are deemed bigger threats. With U. S. leadership, the new coalition could address the policy omissions in the JCPOA by, for example, securing an agreement with Iran to verifiably curb its regional aggression, state sponsorship of terrorism and domestic repression of human rights. In exchange, Iran could be given   sanctions relief and even normalization of relations. However, if Iran refuses, the United States and our allies will have great leverage to hold Tehran accountable under the existing accord. Iran has already twice exceeded its allotted limit for heavy water; it has   multiple ballistic missiles, in defiance of U. N. Resolution 2231, which endorses the nuclear deal; and, according to German intelligence estimates, Iran has continued its “illegal   procurement activities” at a “quantitatively high level. ” The United States and its partners have closely adhered to the letter of the JCPOA; they should demand that Iran do the same. The Trump administration can also designate the entire Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) as a foreign terrorist organization. To date, only its extraterritorial Quds Force has been labeled as such by the Treasury Department. If done correctly, such a move could freeze foreign investment in Iran because of the IRGC’s pervasiveness in the Iranian economy through front companies. Trump can also support legislation in Congress punishing sectors of the Iranian economy that support Iran’s ballistic missile program, and he can propose measures to curb Iranian access to U. S. dollars. To persuade Iran to abide by both the letter and spirit of the JCPOA, as Dennis Ross and retired Army Gen. David H. Petraeus have argued, strengthening deterrence will be key. Setting forth a “blunter statement on the consequences” of continued Iranian intransigence  —   even in an authorization for the use of military force in the most dire crisis  —   might change Ayatollah Ali Khamenei’s calculations. If Iran does not change course, the   should make clear he is prepared to impose a new round of comprehensive secondary sanctions against Iran  —   and then to walk away, with cause, from the JCPOA. Then it will be time, as the   has said, to tear up this agreement. Such a    strategy will make clear that the United States is willing to work with Iran but that there will be consequences for the Iranians if no diplomatic solution is reached. At its best, such an approach can be transformational. At the least, it will rewrite the current nuclear deal, relegating to history a period in which the great powers legitimized Iran’s rogue nuclear program without asking the regime to change its radical, terrorist, repressive and expansionist ways.

"," THE OBAMA administration announced Sunday that it is denying an easement needed to build the Dakota Access Pipeline, which would run crude oil from North Dakota to Illinois. The project is mostly built on private land but requires approval from the Army Corps of Engineers to cross federally regulated waters, including Lake Oahe, a section of the Missouri River. The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe  which governs a reservation near the lake, objects that the project threatens its water and violates sacred land. The protest camp the tribe created has swelled with activists from across the country, who have clashed with local authorities. So, with the harsh Dakota winter descending on the camp, the Army Corps said Sunday it would examine new routes in consultation with tribal leaders. It is hard not to have sympathy for the tribe. Driven off their territory and cordoned into a small reservation, the Standing Rock and other Native American communities were victims of grave injustice as white Americans moved relentlessly west in pursuit of land and fortune. The area outside the reservation still holds historical and cultural significance, which deserves careful consideration.  Yet that is exactly what the Standing Rock Sioux already received, to the degree the federal government could provide it. A September court ruling denied its request for an injunction against the project, in part because, according to U. S. District Judge James E. Boasberg, the federal government exceeded legal requirements that it consider potential archeological damage and seek input from Native American leaders when considering permits for pipeline water crossings. In fact, the court documented the great lengths to which the Army Corps went to engage with the Standing Rock Sioux and adjust the routing when concerns were aired. The tribe demanded more, including that the Army Corps scrutinize the pipeline route from beginning to end  —   even though the agency does not have jurisdiction over the private land on which most of it will run. Mr. Boasberg noted that the tribe made this request for administrative overreach based on little serious evidence of impending harm. “Standing Rock needs to offer more than vague assertions that some places in the Midwest around some bodies of water may contain some sacred sites that could be affected,” the judge wrote.  For its part, the Army Corps insists it faithfully followed the law but that it made a “policy decision” to seek “a more robust consideration of alternatives and additional public information,” according to a spokeswoman. Yet it is not as though the originally proposed route, which at places carefully snaked around sensitive sites, was arbitrary. In fact, it would parallel an existing gas pipeline tunneling below Lake Oahe. If this new process uncovers a Goldilocks route that everyone can support, great. But, as with any infrastructure project, it is unlikely there is a magic solution that satisfies every preference. Politicizing the permitting process, moreover, is unlikely to make it fairer. The Dakota Access affair is the second major instance of pipeline activism in recent years. It and Keystone XL became highly visible symbols of much larger fights about the environment and tribal rights. But no matter how big the issues activists attached to them, these pipelines, at their core, are nothing more than routine infrastructure projects, thousands of which underpin the U. S. economy. The approval or denial of one or two will do little to cure global oil addiction or right generations of harm to tribal groups.

142099,217469,"Hospitals warn Trump, Congress of massive losses with Affordable Care Act repeal",Washington Post,Amy Goldstein,2016-12-06,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161207004552/https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/hospitals-warn-trump-congress-of-massive-losses-with-affordable-care-act-repeal/2016/12/06/3de2f7de-bbd8-11e6-91ee-1adddfe36cbe_story.html
"," The nation’s hospital industry warned   Trump and congressional leaders on Tuesday that repealing the Affordable Care Act could cost hospitals $165 billion by the middle of the next decade and trigger “an unprecedented public health crisis. ” The two main trade groups for U. S. hospitals dispatched a letter to the incoming president and Capitol Hill’s top four leaders, saying that the government should help hospitals avoid massive financial losses if the law is rescinded in a way that causes a surge of uninsured patients. The letter, along with a consultant’s study estimating the financial impact of undoing the Affordable Care Act, makes hospitals the first sector of the   industry to speak out publicly to try to protect itself from a sharp reversal in health policy that Trump is promising and congressional Republicans have long favored. When it was enacted in 2010, the   law was a product of a delicate balancing act among various parts of the   industry. Each essentially agreed to sacrifices in exchange for the prospect of millions of Americans gaining insurance to help cover their medical expenses. Since Trump’s election last month, most   sectors have quietly been trying to glean  —   and influence  —   the thinking within Congress’s GOP majority and the  ’s transition team.     Post reporter Amy Goldstein walks us through what changes health care will face under a Trump presidency.   Donald Trump campaigned on his promise to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. (The Washington Post)   America’s Health Insurance Plans (AHIP) the insurers’ main lobby, has been holding private meetings with members of Congress. According to an AHIP spokeswoman, the group is urging that a repeal of the Affordable Care Act avoid disrupting newly gained coverage, eliminate certain taxes the law placed on insurers and replace the requirement that most Americans carry insurance with strong financial incentives for coverage. In contrast, the American Hospital Association and the Federation of American Hospitals (FAH) convened a news conference Tuesday to release the study’s findings and draw attention to their concerns. Charles N. “Chip” Kahn III, president of FAH, a   group, said the amount of money that hospitals could lose under a repeal of the Affordable Care Act was “unsettling. ” Joann Anderson, president of Southeastern Health, a financially fragile rural hospital in Lumberton, N. C. one of that state’s most economically depressed areas, said the prospect of repealing the health law without a replacement to keep people insured is “  . . . We cannot take additional cuts. ” The study, by the health economics consulting firm Dobson DaVanzo, used as its starting point a bill that is the only Affordable Care   legislation that Congress has produced. It was vetoed early this year by President Obama. That legislation would have eliminated crucial parts of the health law  —   among them, federal subsidies for health plans people buy through insurance marketplaces created by the law, penalties for violating its insurance requirements, and the expansion of Medicaid that 31 states have adopted. Borrowing from Congressional Budget Office estimates, the study says a similar repeal would cause an additional 22 million people to be uninsured by 2026. By then, it predicts, hospitals would lose $165 billion as a result  —   and $102 billion more unless the government reverses certain payment cuts the law made to hospitals that treat many uninsured patients. The hospital groups say that if Trump and Congress repeal the Affordable Care Act without replacing it right away, they should also restore government payments for hospital care of Medicare and Medicaid patients to what they were before the 2010 law. When it was enacted, the premise was that hospitals could absorb lower payments if more people were insured. A spokeswoman for House Speaker Paul D. Ryan ( .) noted that Ryan has said he favors a transition period to phase out the law but has not specified how long he prefers. A spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell ( .) said that the senator has held over 100 meetings with hospital leaders, employees and patients “to hear   about the damage the law is doing. ” Spokesmen for the Trump transition team did not answer repeated requests for a reply, except for a note that said: “We have received your request. Due to the volume of requests coming in, response time may be slower than usual. ”  "

","       CHARLESTON, S. C.  —   The room where it happened looks like a million other church basements. Shiny linoleum floors. A drop ceiling. Folding chairs and tables. And, this week, workers hanging festive green and red Christmas decorations. Mother Emanuel is trying to heal by relying on what the Rev. Eric S. C. Manning calls “an unshakable faith and trust in God. ” Parishioners are struggling to recover from what prosecutors call the methodical bloodlust of a   dropout radicalized to hate blacks in the septic swamp of the Internet’s   fringes. The brutal night of June 17, 2015, is about to come alive again for the worshipers of Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church, and the rest of this historic seaside city, with Wednesday’s scheduled opening arguments in the federal hate crimes trial of Dylann Storm Roof.  “The wound is open, the pain will be there, surely. We are taking one day at a time,” Manning said in his basement office, next to the room where nine black men and women, ages 26 to 87, were killed. “Our faith is founded on the fact that God said, ‘Trust me.’ ”    The Rev. Eric S. C. Manning took over after the death of the Rev. Clementa Pinckney, who was killed in Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church on June 17, 2015. (Alex Holt for The Washington Post)  The killings so horrified the nation that President Obama came here and led an emotional memorial service by singing “Amazing Grace. ” Now some are questioning the Obama administration’s decision to seek the federal death penalty when Roof, 22, has offered to plead guilty in exchange for a sentence of life in prison, potentially averting a painful trial. “It’s a political statement as much as anything else and really unnecessary at this point,” said Andrew J. Savage III, a longtime Charleston lawyer here who represents the three survivors of the attack and many family members of the victims. The Roof trial comes as Charleston is also grappling with the racially charged case of white former police officer Michael Slager, who killed Walter Scott, an unarmed black man, as he was running away from a traffic stop in April 2015. The judge in Slager’s trial declared a mistrial Monday when jurors said that they could not reach a verdict. Prosecutors have vowed to retry Slager, whose defense attorney is Savage.  Charleston, where the first shots of the Civil War were fired, has a long and difficult history with race relations. But the Roof and Slager cases have forced this genteel Southern city that prides itself on politeness and civility to discuss issues of race more openly.      Attorneys for the family of Walter Scott, the black man who was shot dead by police officer Michael Slager, reacted on Monday to news of his mistrial, saying the officer has ”delayed” justice but will not ”escape” it. (Reuters)   “This has caused an awakening,” said Joseph P. Riley Jr. who retired in January after more than 40 years as the city’s mayor. “We thought we were living in a   society, and this was a hurtful and heartbreaking  . We’re all more aware now. ” Riley, who still chokes up talking about the killings at the church often referred to as “Mother Emanuel,” said they have “caused everyone in this city to talk more fully about matters of race. ” He said “new alliances” of lawyers and other professionals have been formed to discuss race, and “we talk to each other, we don’t talk at each other. ” Riley is also leading an effort to build a $75 million International African American Museum on the site of a Charleston wharf where hundreds of thousands of slaves arrived in the United States. “We will confront this hateful bigotry,” he said.     A grand jury indicted Dylann Roof, who confessed to killing nine people during Bible studies at a historic black church in Charleston, S. C. on 33 federal counts, including hate crime charges. (Charleston County Sheriff’s   Press)  Roof’s guilt is essentially uncontested. He has offered to plead guilty. The remaining question is his punishment, and the federal government is seeking death  —   a sentence it pursues in only the most extreme cases, such as that of Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh. Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch announced in May that federal prosecutors would seek the death penalty for Roof, who is also scheduled to face a state murder trial in January that potentially carries the death penalty. The Justice Department’s court filing in the case cited Roof’s planning and premeditation, “animosity towards African Americans” and “lack of remorse” and said he chose a church for his rampage to “magnify the societal impact. ”  Lynch made her decision over the objections of some advising her, including William Nettles, then the U. S. attorney in South Carolina, and Vanita Gupta, the head of the Justice Department’s civil rights division, according to a person familiar with the deliberations. Nettles said that because local prosecutors were already seeking the death penalty for Roof, it was unnecessary for the federal government to do the same. “My view of federalism was that we should be like good dinner guests: We should come when we’re invited, help clean up and leave, and that our role was to do what the state was unwilling or unable to do,” Nettles said in an interview. Since the federal death penalty was reinstated in 1988, the government has put just three inmates to death, including McVeigh. There are 62 inmates on federal death row compared with nearly 3, 000 awaiting state executions, according to the Death Penalty Information Center, a   nonprofit. The most recent addition to the federal list was Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev. Despite seeking the death penalty for Roof, the Justice Department has announced what is effectively a moratorium on federal executions while authorities review their policy, and it does not appear it will conclude before the new administration takes over.  Obama has called the death penalty “deeply troubling” but has remained in favor of using it for particularly heinous crimes.   Donald Trump, meanwhile, has been a vocal supporter of the death penalty. A recent University of South Carolina poll found a racial disparity in views on Roof’s punishment that reflects black distrust of the death penalty, which has been used disproportionately against black defendants. Although Roof is white, the polls found that almost 65 percent of black South Carolina residents said that they thought Roof should not be executed. In the same poll, about 65 percent of whites said that they thought he should. In Charleston this week, families of the victims were divided about whether Roof should be executed, but most seemed willing to accept whatever justice the courts impose.      Read the victims’ stories View Graphic     Read the victims’ stories  Manning, who took over the position held by the Rev. Clementa Pinckney, 41, the first person shot, said the church is opposed to the death penalty on religious grounds, but parishioners also respect “civil law. ” “The government is well within their rights to do what needs to be done,” Manning said. “At the end of the day, we are just looking for justice. ” Steve Schmutz, a lawyer representing family members of three of the victims, said his clients “are trusting the U. S. attorney’s office. ” “The government is going for the death penalty, so they support it,” he said. “If the government hadn’t gone for the death penalty, I think they would have supported that. ” Kevin Singleton, 43, whose mother, Myra Thompson, was killed, said that he thought executing Roof or sentencing him to life would be a deterrent to “copycats” who might be inspired to do something similar. “Life in prison, the death penalty  —   at the end of the day, it’s not going to bring anybody back,” he said. “It’s not going to be closure. ” In preliminary hearings, U. S. District Judge Richard M. Gergel found Roof competent to stand trial and reluctantly agreed to Roof’s “unwise” request to act as his own lawyer. But over the weekend, Roof reversed himself and Gergel agreed to allow him to reinstate his legal team. Family members had been preparing to be questioned directly by Roof on the witness stand. Savage said that they had viewed it as “their opportunity to look him in the eye” and that they were “not intimidated at all. ”  One of those scheduled to testify is Felicia Sanders, who survived the attack by falling on the floor and shielding her    granddaughter. Savage said Sanders watched as the gunman killed her aunt, Susie Jackson, 87, and her son, Tywanza Sanders, 26  —   the oldest and youngest victims. Polly Sheppard, a retired nurse, the only other adult survivor, is also slated to testify. Savage said Roof deliberately spared Sheppard that night, because, Roof told her, “I want you to tell the world what happened in here. ”       A    white man accused of murdering nine people in a historic black South Carolina church makes his first court appearance. (Reuters)   Sanders and Sheppard gave emotional speeches in support of   legislation at last summer’s Democratic National Convention. Sanders quoted from the words her son, Tywanza, said to Roof just before he was killed: “We mean you no harm. You don’t have to do this. ” “Two days later, I forgave the shooter that murdered him,” Sanders told the convention. “Hate destroys those who harbor it. I refuse to let hate destroy me. ” Savage said many family members had trouble accepting that someone as young as Roof could have acted alone. So in   he said, federal prosecutors invited Sanders, Sheppard and a small group of others to watch a video of Roof’s initial interview with the FBI. “They were overwhelmed with the hatred he had and what he expressed and his unrepentance,” Savage said. “They almost had a hope that somebody else was involved, in the sense that you didn’t want to attribute such a horrific   to such a young person. The video went a long way to convince them otherwise. ” Aja’ Risher, 32, whose grandmother, Ethel Lance, 70, was killed, said that she is not an enthusiastic supporter of the death penalty but that it would be appropriate in Roof’s case. “I would like for the same mercy to be shown to him that was shown to my grandmother,” she said. “If this case does not warrant a death penalty, then what case would?”  Zapotosky reported from Washington. Mark Berman and Sari Horwitz in Washington contributed to this report.      "
142101,217471,Pentagon buries evidence of $125 billion in bureaucratic waste,Washington Post,Craig Whitlock,2016-12-05,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161207004552/https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/pentagon-buries-evidence-of-125-billion-in-bureaucratic-waste/2016/12/05/e0668c76-9af6-11e6-a0ed-ab0774c1eaa5_story.html
","            The Pentagon has buried an internal study that exposed $125 billion in administrative waste in its business operations amid fears Congress would use the findings as an excuse to slash the defense budget, according to interviews and confidential memos obtained by The Washington Post.  Pentagon leaders had requested the study to help make their enormous   bureaucracy more efficient and reinvest any savings in combat power. But after the project documented far more wasteful spending than expected, senior defense officials moved swiftly to kill it by discrediting and suppressing the results. The report, issued in January 2015, identified “a clear path” for the Defense Department to save $125 billion over five years. The plan would not have required layoffs of civil servants or reductions in military personnel. Instead, it would have streamlined the bureaucracy through attrition and early retirements, curtailed   contractors and made better use of information technology. The study was produced last year by the Defense Business Board, a federal advisory panel of corporate executives, and consultants from McKinsey and Company. Based on reams of personnel and cost data, their report revealed for the first time that the Pentagon was spending almost a quarter of its $580 billion budget on overhead and core business operations such as accounting, human resources, logistics and property management.     The data showed that the Defense Department was paying a staggering number of people  —   1, 014, 000 contractors, civilians and uniformed personnel  —   to fill   jobs far from the front lines. That workforce supports 1. 3 million troops on active duty, the fewest since 1940. The   study could find a receptive audience with   Donald Trump. He has promised a major military buildup and said he would pay for it by “eliminating government waste and budget gimmicks. ”     Robert “Bobby” L. Stein, former chairman of the Defense Business Board. He serves as managing director of Chartwell Capital Management and president of the Regency Group. (Thomas   of Chartwell Capital Management)  For the military, the major allure of the study was that it called for reallocating the $125 billion for troops and weapons. Among other options, the savings could have paid a large portion of the bill to rebuild the nation’s aging nuclear arsenal, or the operating expenses for 50 Army brigades. But some Pentagon leaders said they fretted that by spotlighting so much waste, the study would undermine their repeated public assertions that years of budget austerity had left the armed forces starved of funds. Instead of providing more money, they said, they worried Congress and the White House might decide to cut deeper. So the plan was killed. The Pentagon imposed secrecy restrictions on the data making up the study, which ensured no one could replicate the findings. A   summary report that had been made public was removed from a Pentagon website. “They’re all complaining that they don’t have any money. We proposed a way to save a ton of money,” said Robert “Bobby” L. Stein, a   investor from Jacksonville, Fla. who served as chairman of the Defense Business Board. Stein, a campaign bundler for President Obama, said the study’s data were “indisputable” and that it was “a travesty” for the Pentagon to suppress the results. “We’re going to be in peril because we’re spending dollars like it doesn’t matter,” he added. The missed opportunity to streamline the military bureaucracy could soon have large ramifications. Under the 2011 Budget Control Act, the Pentagon will be forced to stomach $113 billion in automatic cuts over four years unless Congress and Trump can agree on a   spending deal by October. Playing a key role in negotiations will probably be Trump’s choice for defense secretary, retired Marine Gen. James Mattis. The Defense Business Board was ordered to conduct the study by Deputy Defense Secretary Robert O. Work, the Pentagon’s    official. At first, Work publicly touted the efficiency drive as a top priority and boasted about his idea to recruit corporate experts to lead the way. After the board finished its analysis, however, Work changed his position. In an interview with The Post, he did not dispute the board’s findings about the size or scope of the bureaucracy. But he dismissed the $125 billion savings proposal as “unrealistic” and said the business executives had failed to grasp basic obstacles to restructuring the public sector.       The Post’s Craig Whitlock discusses the $125 billion in administrative waste, as well as its implications for the Pentagon and Congress. (The Washington Post)   “There is this meme that we’re some bloated, giant organization,” he said. “Although there is a little bit of truth in that . . . I think it vastly overstates what’s really going on. ” Work said the board fundamentally misunderstood how difficult it is to eliminate federal civil service jobs  —   members of Congress, he added, love having them in their districts  —   or to renegotiate defense contracts. He said the Pentagon is adopting some of the study’s recommendations on a smaller scale and estimated it will save $30 billion by 2020. Many of the programs he cited, however, have been on the drawing board for years or were unrelated to the Defense Business Board’s research. Work acknowledged that the push to improve business operations lost steam after   Secretary Chuck Hagel was replaced by Ashton B. Carter in February 2015. Carter has emphasized other goals, such as strengthening the Pentagon’s partnerships with   firms. “We will never be as efficient as a commercial organization,” Work said. “We’re the largest bureaucracy in the world. There’s going to be some inherent inefficiencies in that. ” ‘Dark matter’ Work, a retired Marine officer, became deputy defense secretary in May 2014. With the military budget under the most pressure since the end of the Cold War, he sought help from the Defense Business Board, an advisory panel known for producing management studies that usually gathered dust. Work told the board that the outcome of this assignment would be different. In a memo, he directed the board to collect sensitive cost data from the military services and defense agencies that would reveal how much they spent on business operations.    Pentagon officials knew their   bureaucracy was overstaffed and overfunded. But nobody had ever gathered and analyzed such a comprehensive set of data before. Some Defense Business Board members warned that exposing the extent of the problem could have unforeseen consequences. “You are about to turn on the light in a very dark room,” Kenneth Klepper, the former chief executive of Medco Health Solutions, told Work in the summer of 2014, according to two people familiar with the exchange. “All the crap is going to float to the surface and stink the place up. ” “Do it,” Work replied. To turn on the light, the Pentagon needed more outside expertise. A team of consultants from McKinsey was hired. In a confidential August 2014 memo, McKinsey noted that while the Defense Department was “the world’s largest corporate enterprise,” it had never “rigorously measured” the “  speed, agility or quality” of its business operations. Nor did the Pentagon have even a remotely accurate idea of what it was paying for those operations, which McKinsey divided into five categories: human resources;   management; supply chain and logistics; acquisition and procurement; and   management. McKinsey hazarded a guess: anywhere between $75 billion and $100 billion a year, or between 15 and 20 percent of the Pentagon’s annual expenses. “No one REALLY knows,” the memo added. The mission would be to analyze, for the first time, dozens of databases that tracked civilian and military personnel, and labor costs for defense contractors. The problem was that the databases were in the grip of the armed forces and a multitude of defense agencies. Many had fought to hide the data from outsiders and bureaucratic rivals, according to documents and interviews. Information on contractor labor, in particular, was so cloaked in mystery that McKinsey described it as “dark matter. ”  Prying it loose would require direct orders from Work. Even then, McKinsey consultants predicted the bureaucracy would resist. “This is a sensitive exercise conducted with audiences both ‘weary’ and ‘wary’ of efficiency, cost, sequestration and budget drills,” the confidential memo stated. “Elements of the culture are masterful at ‘waiting out studies and sponsors,’ with a ‘this too shall pass’ mindset. ” Overstaffed chow hall From the outset, access to the data was limited to a handful of people. A $2. 9 million consulting contract signed by the Pentagon stipulated that none of the data or analysis could be released to the news media or the public. Moreover, the contract required McKinsey to report to David Tillotson III, the Pentagon’s acting deputy chief management officer. Anytime the Defense Business Board wanted the consultants to carry out a task, Tillotson would have to approve. His office  —   not the board  —   would maintain custody of the data. “Good news!” Work emailed Tillotson once the contract was signed. “Time to cook. ” In an Oct. 15, 2014, memo, Work ordered the board to move quickly, giving it three months to produce “specific and actionable recommendations. ” In a speech the next month, Work lauded the board for its   expertise. He said he had turned it into “an operational arm” of the Pentagon leadership and predicted the study would deliver transformational results. In an aside, he revealed that early findings had determined the average administrative job at the Pentagon was costing taxpayers more than $200, 000, including salary and benefits. “And you say, hmmm, we could probably do better than that,” he said. The initial results did not come as a surprise. Former defense secretaries William S. Cohen, Robert M. Gates and Chuck Hagel had launched similar efficiency drives in 1997, 2010 and 2013, respectively. But each of the leaders left the Pentagon before their revisions could take root. “Because we turn over our secretaries and deputy secretaries so often, the bureaucracy just waits things out,” said Dov Zakheim, who served as Pentagon comptroller under President George W. Bush. “You can’t do it at the tail end of an administration. It’s not going to work. Either you leave the starting block with a very clear program, or you’re not going to get it done. ” Arnold Punaro, a retired Marine general and former staff director for the Senate Armed Services Committee, said lawmakers block even modest attempts to downsize the Pentagon’s workforce because they do not want to lose jobs in their districts. Without backing from Congress, “you can’t even get rid of the guy serving butter in the chow hall in a local district, much less tens of thousands of jobs,” he said.    Deputy Defense Secretary Robert O. Work, the Pentagon’s    official, ordered the Defense Business Board to conduct the study. (Kate   The Washington Post)  ‘Time to hunt!’ The Defense Business Board assigned five members to conduct the study alongside consultants from McKinsey. Scott Rutherford, senior partner at McKinsey’s Washington office, declined to comment. The team ran into resistance as several Pentagon offices delayed requests for data, according to emails and memos. Work and Tillotson had to intervene to get the data flowing. At one point, more than 100 people were feeding data from different sectors of the bureaucracy. Laboring under its tight deadline, the team hashed out an agreement with Pentagon officials over which job classifications to count in their survey. The board added a sixth category of business operations  —   real property management. That alone covered 192, 000 jobs and annual expenses of $22. 6 billion. On Christmas Eve, Klepper emailed Work and Tillotson to thank them for putting their muscle behind the project. Without it, he said, “this would all have been DOA and the naysayers would all have been right. ” He hinted the board would make some   recommendations and expressed relief its work had not been torpedoed. “I have to admit, with all the caution, negative reaction and pushback,” Klepper said, “I had a bit of concern at the end of the analysis some form of censorship would stop us from showing the true opportunity. ” Work replied that he could not be happier. “Time to hunt!” he said in an email, adding that he was “very excited about 2015” and ready to make “some bold moves. ” The year kicked off with promise. On Jan. 21, 2015, the Pentagon announced Stein, the   investor, had been reappointed as the board’s chairman and praised him for his “outstanding service. ” The next day, the full board held its quarterly public meeting to review the results of the study. The report had a dry title, “Transforming DoD’s Core Business Processes for Revolutionary Change,” and was packed with charts and jargon. But it began plainly enough. “We are spending a lot more money than we thought,” the report stated. It then broke down how the Defense Department was spending $134 billion a year on business operations  —   about 50 percent more than McKinsey had guessed at the outset. Almost half of the Pentagon’s   personnel  —   457, 000   employees  —   were assigned to logistics or   jobs. That alone exceeded the size of United Parcel Service’s global workforce. The Pentagon’s purchasing bureaucracy counted 207, 000   workers. By itself, that would rank among the top 30 private employers in the United States. More than 192, 000 people worked in property management. About 84, 000 people held   jobs. The study laid out a range of options. At the low end, just by renegotiating service contracts and hiring   workers, the Pentagon could save $75 billion over five years. At the high end, by adopting more aggressive productivity targets, it could save twice as much. After a discussion, the full board voted to recommend a middle option: to save $125 billion over five years. Hordes of contractors Afterward, board members briefed Work. They were expecting an enthusiastic response, but the deputy defense secretary looked uneasy, according to two people who were present. He singled out a page in the report. Titled “Warfighter Currency,” it showed how saving $125 billion could be redirected to boost combat power. The money could cover the operational costs for 50 Army brigades, or 3, 000   Joint Strike Fighters for the Air Force, or 10   strike groups for the Navy. “This is what scares me,” he said, according to the two people present. Work explained he was worried Congress might see it as an invitation to strip $125 billion from the defense budget and spend it somewhere else.  A few weeks later, Carter replaced Hagel as defense secretary. Carter sounded as though he would welcome the kind of revolutionary change the board was urging. “To win support from our fellow citizens for the resources we need, we must show that we can make better use of every taxpayer dollar,” Carter said in an inaugural message in February 2015. “That means a leaner organization, less overhead, and reforming our business and acquisition practices. ” In briefings that month, uniformed military leaders were receptive at first. They had long groused that the Pentagon wasted money on a layer of defense bureaucracies  —   known as the Fourth Estate  —   that were outside the control of the Army, Air Force and Navy. Military officials often felt those agencies performed duplicative services and oversight. But the McKinsey consultants had also collected data that exposed how the military services themselves were spending princely sums to hire hordes of defense contractors. For example, the Army employed 199, 661   contractors, according to a confidential McKinsey report obtained by The Post. That alone exceeded the combined civil workforce for the Departments of State, Agriculture, Commerce, Education, Energy, and Housing and Urban Development. The average cost to the Army for each contractor that year: $189, 188, including salary, benefits and other expenses. The Navy was not much better. It had 197, 093 contractors on its payroll. On average, each cost $170, 865. In comparison, the Air Force had 122, 470 contractors. Each cost, on average, $186, 142.    Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter has emphasized goals such as strengthening the Pentagon’s partnerships with   firms. (Alex   Images)  Taking fire Meantime, the backlash to the $125 billion savings plan intensified. On Feb. 6, 2015, board members briefed Frank Kendall III, the Pentagon’s chief  . Kendall’s operations were a major target of the study; he oversaw an empire of purchasing agents and contractors that were constantly under attack from Congress for cost overruns and delays. Kendall put up a stiff fight. He challenged the board’s data and strenuously objected to the conclusion that his offices were overstaffed. “Are you trying to tell me we don’t know how to do our job?” he said, according to two participants in the meeting. He said he needed to hire 1, 000 more people to work directly under him, not fewer. “If you don’t believe me, call in an auditor,” replied Klepper, the board’s restructuring expert. “They’ll tell you it’s even worse than this. ” In an interview, Kendall acknowledged he was “very disappointed” by the board’s work, which he criticized as “shallow” and “very low on content. ” He said the study had ignored efforts by his agencies to become more efficient, and he accused the board of plucking the $125 billion figure out of thin air. “It was essentially a ballpark,   number,” he said. Still, Kendall knew that lawmakers might view the study as credible. Alarmed, he said, he went to Work and warned that the findings could “be used as a weapon” against the Pentagon. “If the impression that’s created is that we’ve got a bunch of money lying around and we’re being lazy and we’re not doing anything to save money, then it’s harder to justify getting budgets that we need,” Kendall said. More ominously, board members said they started to get the silent treatment from the Pentagon’s highest ranks. Briefings that had been scheduled for military leaders in the Tank  —   the secure conference room for the Joint Chiefs of Staff  —   were canceled. Worse, the board was unable to secure an audience with Carter, the new defense secretary. Stein, the board chairman, accused Carter of deliberately derailing the plan through inaction. “Unfortunately, Ash  —   for reasons of his own  —   stopped this,” he said in an interview. Peter Cook, a spokesman for Carter, said the Pentagon chief was busy dealing with “a long list of national security challenges. ” He added that Work and other senior officials had already “concluded that the report, while   had limited value. ” The fatal blow was struck in April. Just three months after Stein had been reappointed as board chairman, Carter replaced him with Michael Bayer, a business consultant who had previously served on the panel and clashed with Stein. Bayer declined to comment. A few weeks later, Klepper resigned from the board. The $125 billion savings plan was dead. In an interview, Tillotson, the Pentagon’s acting deputy chief management officer, called the board’s recommendations too ambitious and aggressive. “They, perhaps, underestimated the degree of difficulty we have in doing something that in the commercial sector would seem to be very easy to do. ” Yet he acknowledged that its overall strategy for scaling back the bureaucracy was sound and that, given more time, it would be possible to realize huge savings. “If we had a longer timeline, yes, it would be a reasonable approach,” he said. “You might get there eventually. ” Ending the debate Frustration, however, persisted in some corners over the Pentagon’s unwillingness to tackle the inefficiency and waste documented by the study. On June 2, 2015, Navy Secretary Ray Mabus delivered a speech at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank. He complained that 20 percent of the defense budget went to the Fourth Estate  —   the defense agencies that provide support to the armed forces  —   and called it “pure overhead. ”    Navy Secretary Ray Mabus takes his seat to testify to the Senate Armed Services Committee in February 2016. (Kevin Lamarque  )  He singled out the Defense Finance and Accounting Service and the Defense Logistics Agency, which together employ about 40, 000 people, as egregious examples. When a reporter in the audience asked whether he thought the agencies should be abolished, Mabus resisted the temptation to say yes. “Nice try on getting me into deep trouble,” he replied. But trouble arrived in Mabus’s email the next day. “Ray, before you publicly trash one of the agencies that reports through me I’d really appreciate a chance to discuss it with you,” wrote Kendall, the Pentagon’s chief   whose management portfolio included the Defense Logistics Agency. He said that if Mabus had a complaint, he should raise it directly with their mutual bosses, Carter and Work, and copied the email to both.  In his interview with The Post, Kendall said he was “completely blindsided” by the Navy secretary’s criticism, “so I sent him what I thought under the circumstances was a pretty polite note. ”  Mabus did not back down. In an emailed retort to Kendall, he referred to the   Defense Business Board study. “I did not say anything yesterday that I have not said both publicly . . . and privately inside this building,” he said. “There have been numerous studies, which I am sure you are aware of, pointing out excessive overhead. ” That prompted a stern intervention from Work. “Ray, please refrain from taking any more public pot shots,” Work said in an email. “I do not want this spilling over into further public discourse. ”  Evelyn Duffy contributed to this report.

"," For 45 minutes, police said, Edgar Maddison Welch, cradling an     rifle, roamed the Comet Ping Pong pizza restaurant looking to prove an Internet conspiracy theory that the popular D. C. restaurant harbored juvenile sex slaves. The few patrons had fled before Welch shot off the lock to an inside door, sending a bullet into a computer tower. The North Carolina man then turned the gun on an employee who emerged from the back holding pizza dough. The worker ran out, unharmed. With D. C. police massing outside on Sunday afternoon, Welch finally walked out with his hands up  —   but not before he finished his search. He had come to rescue the children, court papers say he later told police, and now was convinced that none was being harmed there. D. C. Magistrate Judge Joseph E. Beshouri on Monday ordered Welch  —   known to his friends by his middle name, Maddison  —   jailed until his next hearing on Thursday. He faces several   charges, including assault with a dangerous weapon.     Comet Ping Pong customers came out to support the restaurant after a gunman entered it with an assault rifle, firing it at least once. Several other businesses on the block have received other threats as well. (Whitney   Washington Post)   Assistant U. S. Attorney Sonali Patel said Welch was a danger to the community and a flight risk based on the notoriety of his alleged crimes. His lawyer with the Public Defender Service argued that her client should be released because he had no prior violent offenses.  Welch, bearded and dressed in a white plastic jail jumpsuit for the D. C. Superior Court hearing, said only his name when asked to identify himself. Family and friends said they are struggling to understand how Welch apparently became so fixated on a fake news story that he drove from North Carolina with a Colt long rifle, a .  revolver and a shotgun, determined to take action. The viral Internet tale, which emerged shortly before the presidential election, falsely linked Hillary Clinton, her campaign chairman and the owner of Comet to the alleged   conspiracy.  Welch, described by some friends as a devoted father to two young girls, toyed around with filmmaking and writing, and he had attended a community college. He is an avid hiker. He and his wife are separated, and he has custody of the children. One of Welch’s closest friends of the past eight years said she does not think he intended to shoot anyone. “He most likely really believes the conspiracy theory,” said Kathy Sue Holtorf, who produced one of his films and appeared with him in another. “He’s a good guy with the best of intentions. He probably saw himself as more on a hero mission to save children than anything else. ”         C. restaurant Comet Ping Pong on Sunday.

","  BRUSSELS  —   The United States is discussing with Syrian rebels their surrender and evacuation from Aleppo, as Russia on Tuesday threatened the imminent “elimination” of anyone who refuses to leave the city. “Those who refuse to leave of their own accord will be wiped out,” Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said in Moscow. “There is no other solution. ” Secretary of State John F. Kerry, in Brussels for a meeting of NATO foreign ministers, said he plans to meet with Lavrov later this week for further talks on a proposal for the rebels’ departure that was first discussed Friday. But hopes of agreement on the new plan to stop the carnage in Aleppo, where   Syrian forces made further gains Tuesday in reclaiming   eastern neighborhoods of the city amid widespread civilian casualties, appeared again to falter amid charges, countercharges and confusion.    Lavrov charged, and administration officials sharply denied, that the United States had “revoked” the Friday evacuation proposal. “Serious conversations with our partners do not work,” he said, adding that the United States had notified Moscow that it would not attend a new meeting on the plan. Lavrov said a U. S.  U. N. Security Council resolution over the weekend calling for a   Aleppo truce with the rebels in place, was proof that other U. S. officials had “disavowed” Kerry’s efforts. Russia and China vetoed the resolution. They chose to do so, Britain’s U. N. ambassador, Matthew Rycroft, said, “because of their   misplaced faith in a despot who has killed nearly half a million of his own people, who has sanctioned the murder of civilians as they flee the   ruins of Aleppo. ” Syrian President Bashar   Rycroft said, “would rather reduce Syria to rubble than to negotiate an overdue peace. ” Meanwhile, Kerry told reporters here that he was “not aware of any specific refusal” to meet with Lavrov. During a stop Monday in Berlin, he said the two would meet Thursday in the German city of Hamburg, where they will attend a meeting of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. Administration officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity about the sensitive discussions, suggested that Lavrov was trying to cause mischief and avoid anything that would end the conflict while Russia and Syria destroy as much of the Assad opposition as possible. A brutal government offensive over the past week has driven the opposition out of much of the territory in eastern Aleppo it has held since 2012, and the city is thought to be just days away from falling.       The Syrian army announces the capture of a large swath of eastern Aleppo in an accelerating attack that threatens to crush the opposition. (Reuters)   The U. S. goal, the officials said, is to save as many lives as possible before that happens. They said it had been clear from the start of the most recent   talks that the rebels would have to be consulted on a departure plan. Those discussions, the officials said, are ongoing. Rebel leaders acknowledged that they were discussing evacuation with the United States but said they had yet to be presented with a comprehensive proposal. “The U. S. and Russia couldn’t agree, so there was no plan put up for acceptance,” said one person close to the opposition who spoke on the condition of anonymity as the rebels confront their own disagreements. The evacuation plan  —   under which U. S.  rebels and civilians would depart the city under secure conditions, leaving only the forces of the    group formerly known as Jabhat    —   is different from previous plans.  Russia maintains that the group  —   which Moscow and Washington deem a terrorist organization  —   is the only target of the assault on Aleppo. An earlier proposal by the United Nations called for the group’s fighters to leave the city, with guaranteed secure travel to their stronghold in the neighboring province of Idlib. That would have allowed about a   civilians under siege in eastern Aleppo, along with opposition forces, to remain and facilitated the negotiation of a truce and the flow of humanitarian aid.  Now, the proposal is for everyone else to leave, with only Jabhat   which recently renamed itself Jabhat Fatah   remaining. The United States believes that only a few hundred of the group’s fighters are in Aleppo, while Russia insists there are thousands.  Louisa Loveluck in Beirut contributed to this report.        "

","       PEARL HARBOR, Hawaii  —   When John D. Anderson reached his battle station in the USS Arizona’s No. 4 turret that morning, he realized the gigantic guns could do nothing against the swarms of attacking Japanese airplanes.  But his twin brother, Delbert “Jake” Anderson, was manning an antiaircraft gun out on deck, and was in the thick of the action. “He needs help,” John told his turret commander, and asked if could join his brother. Both men were 24. The sons of a judge, they were born in Verona, N. D. in 1917. Both had joined the Navy in 1936. John was a boatswain’s mate second class; Jake, a boatswain’s mate first class. Both wound up on the Arizona, which at that moment on Dec. 7, 1941, was a maelstrom of fire, smoke and explosions. They would never meet up that Sunday morning, and only one would survive the day. Wednesday, 75 years later, John Anderson’s ashes are to be interred underwater in the remnants of his old turret, rejoining Jake, whose body was never recovered from the ship. The Arizona interment is one of two scheduled for Wednesday that, along with many other commemorations this week, will probably mark the last major anniversary of the attack attended by survivors. The brothers’ reunion, on the anniversary of the attack, brings together one twin who enjoyed a long and varied life, and one whose life stopped at Pearl Harbor. John lived through the rest of the war. He settled in Roswell, N. M. became a local TV personality and died last year at age 98, one of the Arizona’s last survivors. Only five of the original 334 are left. Jake is eternally 24, still “aboard” the Arizona and one the first Americans killed in World War II. John’s family said they believed they should rest together. “He talked all the time about his brother,” John’s son, John D. Anderson Jr. of Carlsbad, N. M. said in a telephone interview last month. They “wrote letters back and forth to each other when they were on different ships. And Jake really wanted him to get on the Arizona with him. ” “They were really close,” he said. During the attack, while searching through the inferno for his brother, John was ordered off the battleship by an officer. “I’m not leaving,” he told the officer, according to a 2011 oral history recorded by videographer Don Smith. “My brother’s here someplace. I’ve got to find him. ” “He couldn’t have made it,” he said the officer replied, and shoved John into a rescue vessel. But after they reached shore, John grabbed an empty boat and went back to the Arizona in the midst of the attack, nearly losing his life in the process. “He just kept saying, ‘I’ve got to find my brother, I’ve got to find my brother,’ ” his son recalled. A wrenching moment in history  Warden was just going back for seconds . . . when this blast shuddered by under the floor and rattled the cups on the tables. . . . He stopped in the doorway . . . and looked back at the messhall. He remembered the picture the rest of his life. It had become very quiet and everybody had stopped eating and looked up at each other. . . . “This is it,” somebody said quite simply.    —   James Jones, “From Here to Eternity”       The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor and the USS Arizona on Dec. 7, 1941, pushed the United States into World War II. But the battleship wasn’t supposed to be docked at the harbor on that date. The Washington Post’s Michael Ruane takes us back to that fateful day in American history. (Claritza Jimenez, Michael   Washington Post)     years later, the Japanese surprise attack on Pearl Harbor remains one of the most wrenching and intimate events in American history. As with the   terrorist attacks, or the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, people remembered where they were when they heard the news. The cost of the attack was stunning: On the Arizona alone, 1, 177 sailors and Marines were killed. More than 900 of them were never recovered.  Thirteen hundred more people died on other ships and elsewhere around the harbor. Many men were blown apart. One survivor recalled that the sky “rained sailors. ” Another remembered dozens of Navy hats floating on the surface of the water. Eleven hundred men were wounded, many horribly burned. “Flames from the inferno leapt up the metal steps and barred our escape,” Arizona survivor Donald Stratton, now 94, wrote in his new memoir, “All the Gallant Men. ” “My   had caught fire, burning my arms and my back,” he wrote. “My legs were burned from my ankles to my thighs. My face was seared. The hair on my head had been singed off, and part of my ear was gone. ” Eighteen U. S. warships were sunk or crippled, along with hundreds of planes destroyed and damaged. The Arizona went down, as did the battleship USS Oklahoma, entombing hundreds of sailors when it capsized. (Today, newly exhumed remains of the Oklahoma’s sailors are still being identified in Defense Department labs.)    The battleship USS Arizona burns in the Hawaiian port of Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7, 1941, after being hit by Japanese   strike aircraft. (REUTERS)   The Japanese, gambling that they could cripple U. S. forces as they expanded their Asian empire, launched the daring attack with 31 ships, including six aircraft carriers, and more than 350 airplanes. Their armada sailed in secret across the stormy northern Pacific Ocean to within striking distance of Hawaii. Its only encounter was with a lone Soviet freighter, which steamed by in silence. The Americans, although forewarned, were overconfident, dismissive of Japanese capabilities, and not expecting the blow to come at Pearl Harbor, historians say. The first U. S. servicemen killed in World War II were three soldiers in two Piper Cubs shot down while on a sightseeing flight as the attack began about 7:55 a. m. Some Americans threw tools, potatoes and binoculars at the enemy aircraft. Others could only shake their fists. A frantic radiogram went out: “AIRRAID ON PEARLHARBOR X THIS IS NO DRILL. ” The effect was electrifying. “Pearl Harbor absolutely shattered Americans’ image of themselves,” said historian Steve Twomey, author of “Countdown to Pearl Harbor. ” The country saw itself as having a fine Army and Navy, and the protection of two oceans. “The wars were always ‘over there,’ ” he said. But within hours that Sunday “millions of families knew . . . that their sons and their brothers and their fathers were going to go war . . . and many of them were not going to come back,” he said. The attack would bring 9 million Americans into the war, and create the powerhouse United States of the 21st century, said historian Craig Nelson, author of “Pearl Harbor, From Infamy to Greatness. ” “Almost every aspect . . . of the United States and its international position in the world . . . comes from the reaction to Pearl Harbor,” he said. It also gave history President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s legendary “A date which will live in infamy” speech, delivered to Congress the next day. It produced the slogan “Praise the Lord, and pass the ammunition,” uttered by Lt. j. g. Howell M. Forgy, a chaplain on the embattled cruiser USS New Orleans. And it provided the story of the heroic African American sailor Dorie Miller, a    mess attendant on the USS West Virginia who manned an antiaircraft gun and opened fire on enemy planes. Miller was decorated for valor, but was killed in the sinking of a ship he was on later in the war. Many of the sailors, soldiers and Marines at Pearl Harbor were children of the Depression and the Dust Bowl who had joined the service to escape poverty and starvation. The   crew on the Arizona was similar in size to the population of some of the small towns the sailors had come from. Now they had hot meals, a hammock to sleep in and a steady paycheck. ‘The Japanese are here’ John Anderson had just made the arrangements for church services on the Arizona’s fantail that Sunday and had gone to the mess hall to get some breakfast. Suddenly, he heard a loud explosion. “I thought, ‘What in the dickens is that?’ ” he said in his video account. He went out on the deck, “looked up and saw this plane dipping . . . and it had red balls on its wings,” he said. “I said a cuss word and said, ‘The Japanese are here,’ ” he remembered. He hurried to sound the alarm, but before he could, a bomb fell nearby and “knocked me silly. ” He got up and ran to his battle station in the turret, which had huge   guns to fire at enemy ships. “I was a gunner,” he said. “I got into the seat and said, ‘Manned and ready.’ ” But he hadn’t seen any enemy ships or enemy shell fire. “There’s all bombs and machine gun fire,” he said he told the turret captain. “We can’t do any good in here. We need some gunners on the antiaircraft batteries. ” “I’d like to get out there and get on a gun with my brother,” he said. The Andersons were among 26 sets of brothers on the ship, but the only twins. The turret captain gave him the okay.

He tried to search for his brother during the attack, but John Anderson was ordered off the battleship by an officer. (Anderson family photo)    Anderson left the turret, and started up a ladder to the antiaircraft guns. “I got to the top of the ladder and an enormous explosion occurred,” he said. “People were blown all over the place, all kinds of body parts . . . and tremendous fires broke out. ” He was driven back toward the turret. “On my way back, I grabbed a guy by the hand who was on fire, and I held on to him,” he said. “He was from Greenfield, Ohio. I never forgot that. I saved him. I got him out of there. ” Meanwhile, officers were ordering survivors off the doomed ship, as more bombs struck. Anderson refused to go until he was forced. Reaching Ford Island, in the middle of the harbor, he looked back at the Arizona. It was still on fire, but his brother and others were out there. He spotted a small boat floating by with nobody in it, and with a buddy swam out, got in and headed back to the ship. There, he gathered three wounded men into the boat. There was no sign of Jake. “We had to take what we could get,” he said, and they headed for shore. As they did, the boat was hit and blown apart. Anderson said his buddy and the three wounded sailors were lost. “I was the only one left alive,” he said. He made it to shore and collapsed on the beach. After the attack ended, he was assigned to another ship, became part of Navy raiding parties and fought his way across the Pacific  —   “in so many scrapes and fights that I forgot the names of the places. ” At first, he heard nothing of Jake, but he was told later that someone had seen him felled at his post by gunfire. “That was the last anybody ever had on my brother,” he said. Wednesday afternoon, about 40 members of his family are scheduled to gather at the USS Arizona memorial in Pearl Harbor as they return Anderson to what is left of Turret No. 4, and to his shipmates and his brother.

142105,217475,Washington Post reporter to write memoir about his 18 months in an Iranian prison,Washington Post,Karen Heller,2016-12-06,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161207004552/https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/post-reporter-to-write-memoir-about-his-18-months-in-an-iranian-prison/2016/12/06/27ea0398-b80c-11e6-b8df-600bd9d38a02_story.html
"," Washington Post reporter Jason Rezaian, who spent 18 months detained in an Iranian prison before his release in January, will write a book about his ordeal for Ecco.  The memoir, tentatively entitled “Hostage: 544 Days, 400 Million Dollars, the Nuclear Deal & Me,” is scheduled for publication in 2018.  “Not knowing when I would get out was an incredible ordeal for my family and me to endure,” says Rezaian, who is studying at Harvard on a Nieman Fellowship. “Now that it’s over, the hard work of putting my life back together continues, and that, too, has included many incredible and often surreal moments. ” Rezaian, 40, was born in San Francisco to an Iranian father and an American mother and was raised in Marin County, Calif. He had lived in Iran since 2009 as a freelance journalist before joining The Washington Post in 2012 as Tehran correspondent.  The book will share his experiences growing up as an Iranian American in the United States and reporting from Iran, as well as the story of his imprisonment. Rezaian says, “I’m looking forward to the opportunity to tell this exciting story, which, while intensely personal, also deals with one of the biggest international news stories of recent times. ” The book was acquired by     TV host Anthony Bourdain, who has an imprint with Ecco, a division of HarperCollins.  Rezaian and his wife, journalist Yeganeh Salehi, were filmed in 2014 for CNN’s “Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown” program about Iran weeks before the couple’s arrest in July. Salehi, who was born in Iran, was detained for more than two months.  “It’s an important story. Harrowing and suspenseful, yes. But it’s also a deep dive into a complex and egregiously misunderstood country with two very different faces,” Bourdain says. “There is no better time to know more about Iran, and Jason Rezaian has seen both of those faces  —   the warmth and hospitality of the people, and the cruelty and absurdity of its security apparatus. I am very proud to be publishing him and grateful to have him back. ”  Rezaian was tried on espionage and related charges in a   trial. He spent 544 days in Tehran’s notorious Evin prison in the wing for political prisoners, 49 of them in solitary confinement.  In October, Rezaian and his family filed a federal lawsuit against the Iranian government, claiming that he was psychologically tortured and used to influence concessions from the U. S. government in Iran’s nuclear negotiations.  “I follow news from Iran very closely still,” he says, “especially the stories of dual nationals like me, who are currently being held hostage there for political reasons. ” Rezaian is a Terker Distinguished Fellow at George Washington University’s School of Media & Public Affairs, where he delivers a monthly guest lecture.  Since his release, “I’ve spent my time recuperating and reconnecting with my family, friends and colleagues,” he says. “I’m catching up on all that happened while I was gone, eating food that I love  —   burritos, lobster rolls and a lot of ramen  —   and following the Golden State Warriors with passion. ”  And, now, writing his memoir.

142106,217476,Suspect in Lyon sisters murders charged in 1996 rape of 6-year-old girl in Virginia,Washington Post,Dan Morse,2016-12-06,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161207004552/https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/public-safety/suspect-in-lyon-sisters-murders-charged-in-1996-rape-of-girl-in-northern-virginia/2016/12/06/78867cc0-bb3e-11e6-ac85-094a21c44abc_story.html
"," A former carnival worker awaiting trial for the 1975 murder of two young Maryland girls  —   Katherine and Sheila Lyon  —   was indicted this week in connection to an unrelated rape of a     in Northern Virginia in 1996, according to court records made public Tuesday.  Lloyd Lee Welch, 59, allegedly assaulted the Virginia victim on a houseboat in Prince William County. The indictment charges him with felonies of rape, aggravated sexual battery and indecent liberties.   The latest charges might give authorities leverage to try to learn more from Welch about the case of the Lyon sisters who disappeared from a shopping mall north of Washington on March 25, 1975, when Sheila was 12 and Katherine, 10. For four decades, detectives made no arrest in the Lyon case.  That changed last year, when Welch was charged with two counts of   murder. Detectives had found his name in old case files from the era in 1975 when he’d been considered a witness, not a suspect, and   him multiple times.    Lloyd Lee Welch Jr. who is awaiting trial for murder in the deaths of Lyon sisters Sheila, 12, and Katherine. 10, after their 1975 disappearance in Maryland, was indicted in Virginia in an unrelated case this week. (Courtesy of Bedford County Sheriff’s   of Bedford County Sheriff’s Office)  Snippets of the freshly recorded interrogations played in court earlier this year in connection with the Lyon murder case indicate detectives and prosecutors believe Welch knows more about what happened to the girls and about others who may have been involved. Their bodies have not been found. Welch has denied he harmed the Lyon sisters. His attorneys in the murder case  —   Aaron Houchens and Anthony Anderson  —   could not be immediately reached for comment Tuesday. The woman in the new Virginia case, now, 27, described her account of an assault in an interview with The Washington Post   “I remember it very clearly,” she said. “It will never leave my mind. ” The woman spoke to The Washington Post on condition her name not be used. The Washington Post generally does not identify people who report they were victims of sexual violence unless they choose to be identified. Her account to the Post was consistent with what she has recently told investigators, according to two law enforcement officials with direct knowledge of the case. She said she was six when she met Welch at a carnival with her family on the day she said he attacked her.  “He came across as a very nice person,” she said. “He plays that ‘I’m a nice guy’ very well. You would think he was someone who you could get along with and trust. ” The night of the alleged assault, she said, she went to sleep on a houseboat where she and her family lived. She said she slept on the bottom bunk of a bed, with two younger brothers sleeping on the top bunk. She said two adults were in a different part of the boat. She said she awoke to Welch raping her but remained silent because she was afraid he would hurt her. “I didn’t know what to do. I kept acting like I was asleep,” she said. She said the alleged attack was not reported to the police at time. Her accusations in the incident surfaced recently as part of the broader Lyon sisters investigation, according to the woman and law enforcement officials. The woman said “it’s a burden I’ve had to carry. If I see someone who looks like him, it freaks me out. ” She said she thinks often about the Lyon sisters and their family and said she hopes her case can be used to find more answers for them. “I’m hoping that they do find all the answers they are looking for,” she said. Finding answers has been a priority for Maryland and Virginia officials overseeing the investigation. According to authorities, when Welch was 18, he and others abducted the Lyon sisters from a shopping mall in Wheaton, killed them and disposed of their bodies on a rural mountain in Bedford County, Va.   At the time the sisters went missing, Welch worked for a traveling carnival company. He lived in Maryland in the Hyattsville area. He had burglary convictions in 1978 in Montgomery County and 1982 in Prince George’s County. Later, in South Carolina, he pleaded guilty to grand larceny and to molesting a    girl.  Then, in Delaware, he pleaded guilty to molesting another    girl. “An outrageous criminal history,” Delaware prosecutor Susan Purcell characterized his record in court in 1998. In the Lyon sisters’ case, detectives combing case files several years ago came across Welch’s name in a report from 1975. They studied his statements, and tracked him to a prison in Delaware where he was serving time on the molestation case, and began interviewing him during repeat visits.  Based on what they heard, detectives said in court records, they had come to believe Welch and others disposed of the girls’ bodies in Bedford County, Va. A grand jury was convened in Bedford, and last year Welch was indicted on two counts of murder in the deaths of Katherine and Sheila Lyon.  His trial date is set for April. "

","     The   piece of apparel during the holidays? Sweaters? Nope. Scarves? No. Ties or hats? Not those either. Socks. The dowdy necessity long regarded as one of the most boring gifts ever, is suddenly cool. Sales of socks  —   particularly funky, patterned, novel varieties  —   are on the upswing, as more Americans look to express themselves through their footwear, according to market research firm NPD Group. And as the holidays near, retailers say we’re approaching peak buying season: Roughly 20 percent of sock purchases take place in December. “There are no rules anymore: Color explosions, crazy themes, patterns without any rhyme or reason,” said Gary Henkin, senior vice president of global sales at Polo Ralph Lauren Hosiery, which includes the popular brand Hot Sox. “Socks have become the ultimate impulse buy. ”  A decade ago, he says, men might have looked to unique ties to express their personalities. But as   becomes the norm in the workplace  —   and   loungewear takes hold everywhere else  —   people are increasingly turning to socks to make a statement. More than 253 million pairs of socks were bought as presents last holiday season, outperforming shirts, sleepwear and sweaters, according to data from the NPD group. And many retailers say this holiday season is shaping up to be the busiest one yet for sock sales. “Oh my goodness gracious, absolutely, socks are an enormous revenue center for us,” said Michele Cosby, owner of Chocolate Moose, a novelty gift shop in downtown Washington. “Christmas and Hanukkah are far and away the biggest sock times for us. ” Currently on the store’s shelves: 111 varieties, including pairs covered in rolls of toilet paper, pizza slices, cows, penguins and Michelangelo’s David that sell for $6 to $12. Cosby says holiday demand for socks has been particularly pronounced in recent years, as customers look for inexpensive and practical gifts. Many people, she said, end up buying socks as Secret Santa gifts for colleagues or relatives. “People are hard to buy for. They have everything,” she said. “Socks are practical  —   they’re useful and fun, and something you can get for someone even if you don’t know them very well. ” At Joy of Socks, a   website that carries 2, 500 varieties of socks, nearly half of the company’s annual sales take place in the last couple of months of the year. The company begins stocking holiday socks in August. “It does seem awfully early, but guess what? That’s when people start buying them,” owner Suzanne Hawes said. “By October, it’s  . ”  This year’s varieties include blue knee socks that say “Mazel Tov,” as well as socks with sledding penguins, kittens in stockings and dogs spinning dreidels. Hawes, who founded the company out of her apartment in 1998, says it’s not uncommon for customers to buy one of each type of holiday sock to give as gifts. “Socks are an easy thing to buy and, well, sock away for gifts,” she said. “They don’t take up a lot of space, and everybody needs them. ”  One of the company’s   lines, by Blue Q, comes adorned with sayings like “Duchess of Sassytown” and “Well, this sucks,” as well as more   designs. “It’s a way to express yourself,” Hawes said. “Sometimes having the ‘f’  on your socks, even if nobody else can see them, is enough to get you through the day. ” Read more: Donating $100M, Sandberg shows how women are leaning in after the election Why vegetarians are peeved about Britain’s new £5 bill D.

142108,217482,"Trump to name Scott Pruitt, Oklahoma attorney general suing EPA on climate change, to head the EPA",Washington Post,Chris Mooney,2016-12-07,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161208000747/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2016/12/07/trump-names-scott-pruitt-oklahoma-attorney-general-suing-epa-on-climate-change-to-head-the-epa/
","           Donald Trump is expected to nominate Scott Pruitt, the attorney general of the oil and   state of Oklahoma, to head the Environmental Protection Agency, a move signaling an assault on President Obama’s climate change and environmental legacy. Pruitt has spent much of his energy as attorney general fighting the very agency he is being nominated to lead. He is the third of Trump’s appointees who have key philosophical differences with the missions of the agencies they have been tapped to run. Ben Carson, named to head the Department of Housing and Urban Development, has expressed a deep aversion to the social safety net programs and fair housing initiatives that have been central to that agency’s activities. Betsy DeVos, named education secretary, has a passion for private school vouchers that critics say undercut the public school systems at the core of the government’s mission. The news about the choice of Pruitt was confirmed by a transition official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity before the official announcement. Pruitt, who has written that the debate on climate change is “far from settled,” joined a coalition of state attorneys general in suing the agency’s Clean Power Plan, the principal   policy aimed at reducing U. S. greenhouse gas emissions from the electricity sector. He has also sued, with fellow state attorneys general, over the EPA’s recently announced regulations seeking to curtail the emissions of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas, from the oil and gas sector. On his Linked In page, Pruitt boasts of being “a leading advocate against the EPA’s activist agenda. ”  After he was elected attorney general in 2010, Pruitt established a “Federalism Unit” to “more effectively combat unwarranted regulation and systematic overreach by federal agencies, boards and offices,” according to his online biography. And he has gone on to challenge the administration not just over the environment but over a host of other areas. He joined other Republican attorneys general in a lawsuit over Obama’s immigration policies. He has also sued the administration over the Affordable Care Act, saying the   mandate on religious employers to provide coverage including contraception was unconstitutional. He has sued over the   financial reform. An ally of the energy industry, Pruitt, along with Alabama Attorney General Luther Strange, came to the defense of ExxonMobil when it fell under investigation by attorneys general from more liberal states seeking information about whether the oil giant failed to disclose material information about climate change. “We do not doubt the sincerity of the beliefs of our fellow attorneys general about climate change and the role human activity plays in it,” they wrote at the conservative publication National Review. “But we call upon them to press those beliefs through debate, not through governmental intimidation of those who disagree with them. ” In an interview with The Post in September, as a D. C. federal appeals court was preparing to hear arguments over the Clean Power Plan, Pruitt detailed why he has remained a leading opponent of the EPA’s efforts to curb carbon emissions by regulating power plants.  “What concerns the states is the process, the procedures, the authority that the EPA is exerting that we think is entirely inconsistent with its constitutional and statutory authority,” he said at the time. Agencies such as the EPA, he said, should not be trying to “pinch hit” for Congress. “This is a unique approach by EPA, whether they want to acknowledge it or not,” he said of the provisions of the Clean Air Act that the agency had relied upon to write new regulations. “The overreach is the statutes do not permit [EPA officials] to act in the way they are. They tend to have this approach that the end justifies the means . . . They tend to justify it by saying this big issue, this is an important issue. ” But he added that’s where Congress should have authority, not EPA. “This is something from a constitutional and statutory perspective that causes great concern. ” Environmental groups reacted with alarm Wednesday at the nomination. And New York State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman vowed to “use the full power” of his office to wage a legal battle to “compel” enforcement of environmental laws under Trump. “Scott Pruitt has a record of attacking the environmental protections that EPA is charged with enforcing. He has built his political career by trying to undermine EPA’s mission of environmental protection,” said Fred Krupp,  president of the Environmental Defense Fund. “Our country needs  —   and deserves  —   an EPA administrator who is guided by science, who respects America’s environmental laws, and who values protecting the health and safety of all Americans ahead of the lobbying agenda of special interests. ”  Rhea Suh, president of the Natural Resources Defense Council, said that “over the past five years, Pruitt has used his position as Oklahoma’s top prosecutor to sue the EPA in a series of attempts to deny Americans the benefits of reducing mercury, arsenic, and other toxins from the air we breathe; cutting smog that can cause asthma attacks; and protecting our wetlands and streams. ” Pruitt has also fought to limit the scope of the federal government in regulating pollution of rivers under the Waters of the United States rule. Sen. Edward J. Markey ( .) who has been active on environmental issues, said, “Scott Pruitt would have EPA stand for Every Polluter’s Ally. ” In 2014, the New York Times reported that a letter ostensibly written by Pruitt alleging that the agency overestimated air pollution from natural gas drilling was actually written by lawyers for Devon Energy, one of the state’s largest oil and gas companies. Industry representatives expressed satisfaction with the choice Wednesday. “The office he headed was present and accounted for in the battle to keep EPA faithful to its statutory authority and respectful of the role of the states in our system of cooperative federalism,” said Scott Segal, head of the policy group at the lobbying and legal firm Bracewell. “Given that we are almost two decades overdue for an overhaul of the Clean Air Act, there is interest on both sides of the aisle to look at that statute. ” David Rivkin, a constitutional litigator who represented Pruitt and Oklahoma in challenging the Clean Power Plan, said he believed Pruitt would be able to make sure the EPA lives up to its mission of protecting air and water while avoiding federal overreach.  “General Pruitt has been the leader among the AGs in defending federalism, the key feature of our constitutional architecture,” said Rivkin, a partner at Baker Hostetler, adding that he believed Pruitt would “ensure both environmental protection and constitutional fidelity. ” Pruitt’s outlook reflects his home state: Oklahoma ranked fifth in the nation in onshore crude oil output in 2014, has five oil refineries, and is home to the giant Cushing oil storage and trading hub, where the price for the benchmark West Texas Intermediate grade is set every day. Although oil and natural gas production sagged in the 1990s and early 2000s, the surge in horizontal fracturing, or fracking, has boosted output. The state’s natural gas output accounts for 10 percent of the nation’s overall total. For the week ended Oct. 28, there were 73 drilling rigs in operation in Oklahoma. Pruitt has served as head of the Republican Attorneys General Association, a group that has relied heavily on funds from ultraconservative groups and the oil industry. The biggest contributors this year included the Judicial Crisis Network, the U. S. Chamber of Commerce’s Institute of Legal Reform, Sheldon Adelson, oil conglomerate Koch Industries and Murray Energy, a leading coal mining company. Pruitt, a Kentucky native who moved to Oklahoma to attend the University of Tulsa law school, has also been active in religious groups. He serves as deacon of the First Baptist Church of Broken Arrow. In 2012, Pruitt was named a trustee of the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary. Before serving as attorney general, he was a member of the state legislature. Dallas investor Doug Deason, a friend of Pruitt, said he expects the Oklahoma attorney general to immediately get to work rolling back the EPA’s “silly overreach” and to let states handle environmental oversight.  “Just like most Republican attorney generals, especially in   states, he has been really frustrated with the government and the EPA’s overreach into everything,” Deason said. But Deason said liberals will be happily surprised by Pruitt’s “ ” attitude, adding that he is “willing to look at things. ” “He will bring a more balanced, logical look” at environmental regulation,” he said. Pruitt’s selection was strongly supported by Oklahoma oil billionaire Harold Hamm. The nomination suggests an extraordinarily tough road ahead for the Clean Power Plan, president Obama’s signature climate policy. However, the precise fate of the regulation most immediately turns on the U. S. Court of Appeals for the D. C. Circuit, which has not yet ruled in the lawsuit brought by Pruitt and his fellow attorneys general against the agency Pruitt is now named to lead. “Some have suggested that Pruitt’s hands might be tied because he participated in litigation against the agency,” Segal said in an email. “This is a silly position. There is no conflict in representing your state on litigation dealing with rules of general applicability and then serving your nation as a federal official. ” Dismantling the regulation if it survives the courts would not be simple, because the agency has already finalized it  —   meaning that to undo and replace it would require a public notice and comment process. Environmental groups would likely sue the agency over such a move. However, some of the Clean Power Plan’s objectives appear to have been already realized long before it came into effect. The United States is already burning less coal and more natural gas, meaning fewer carbon dioxide emissions. In 2030, the EPA projected in its final Clean Power Plan rule, coal would be reduced to providing 27 percent of U. S. electricity, with natural gas at 33 percent. Yet this very year, according to the U. S. Energy Information Administration, natural gas will provide 34 percent of U. S. electricity, and coal 30 percent. Matea Gold contributed to this report.

Kelly picked to head Department of Homeland Security,Washington Post,Jerry Markon,2016-12-07,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161208000747/https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/retired-marine-gen-john-f-kelly-picked-to-head-department-of-homeland-security/2016/12/07/165472f2-bbe6-11e6-94ac-3d324840106c_story.html
","   Donald Trump has chosen retired Marine Gen. John F. Kelly to run the Department of Homeland Security, turning to a   border security hawk who clashed with the Obama administration over women in combat and plans to close the prison at Guantanamo Bay, according to people familiar with the decision. Kelly, who retired in February as chief of U. S. Southern Command, would inherit a massive and often troubled department responsible for overseeing perhaps the most controversial part of Trump’s agenda: his proposed crackdown on illegal immigration. DHS is the   Cabinet department, with more than 240, 000 employees who do everything from fight terrorism to protect the president and enforce immigration laws.  Kelly, 66, is a widely respected military officer who served for more than 40 years, and he is not expected to face difficulty winning Senate confirmation. Trump’s team was drawn to him because of his Southwest border expertise, people familiar with the transition said. Like the   Kelly has sounded the alarm about drugs, terrorism and other   threats he sees as emanating from Mexico and Central and South America. Yet Kelly’s nomination could raise questions about what critics see as Trump’s tendency to surround himself with too many military figures. Trump has also selected retired Marine Gen. James N. Mattis for defense secretary and retired Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn as national security adviser, while retired Army Gen. David H. Petraeus is under consideration for secretary of state.     View Graphic    Here are the people whose names have been floated for Trump’s Cabinet  Kelly, a Boston native, was chosen over an array of other candidates who also met with Trump after his surprise election victory last month. Those in contention included Frances Townsend, a top homeland security and counterterrorism official in the George W. Bush administration; Milwaukee County Sheriff David Clarke and Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach. Clarke and Kobach are vocal Trump backers, and Kobach is nationally known for his strong views on restricting illegal immigration.  Trump’s selection of Kelly for DHS was first reported by CBS News. The Washington Post reported last month that he was the leading candidate for the job. In the end, people familiar with the transition said, the choice came down to Kelly and Rep. Michael McCaul ( .) chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee. McCaul was considered an early favorite, but his chances were hurt by opposition from some conservatives who found him insufficiently tough on border security, the people said. Known inside the Pentagon as a thoughtful man who continued serving his country even after his son was killed in combat, Kelly has talked in stark terms  —   much like Trump  —   about the threats America faces in the Middle East and beyond. In speeches, he has expressed frustration with what he calls the “bureaucrats” in Washington, and he described the military’s counterterrorism operations abroad as a war against a “savage” enemy who would gladly launch more deadly attacks. “Given the opportunity to do another   our vicious enemy would do it today, tomorrow and everyday thereafter,” Kelly said in a 2013 Memorial Day address in Texas. “I don’t know why they hate us, and I frankly don’t care, but they do hate us and are driven irrationally to our destruction. ” His blunt manner led to conflicts within the Obama administration, where he served more than three years as Southern Command chief  —   overseeing military operations across Central and South America  —   and as senior military adviser to defense secretaries Robert M.

","           Donald Trump has selected Terry Branstad, the   Republican governor of Iowa, as ambassador to China, a transition official confirmed Wednesday. Branstad has extensive ties to China and a personal friendship with Chinese President Xi Jinping that dates back decades. If his nomination goes through, the move could help reassure China’s leadership that Trump understands the importance of healthy relations with Beijing. The Chinese reacted with concern to Trump’s   phone call Friday with Tsai   the leader of Taiwan, an island that China considers a rogue province. Trump attacked China repeatedly on the campaign trail, and in a pair of tweets Sunday, over its trade and currency policies, and has criticized the way it has staked its territorial claims in the South China Sea. He has threatened to slap tariffs of up to 45 percent on Chinese goods if Beijing doesn’t “behave. ” The selection of Branstad was first reported by Bloomberg News and confirmed Wednesday by a transition official who requested anonymity because the nomination had not yet been formally announced. Trump transition spokesman Jason Miller told reporters later Wednesday that Branstad has accepted the  ’s offer. “Governor Branstad obviously is Iowa’s   governor, someone who has considerable public policy experience but also someone who has a lot of experience and great grasp of trade issues, agriculture issues, has a tremendous understanding of China and Chinese people [and] is someone who very much impressed the ” Miller said. “It’s very clear that Governor Branstad is someone who will represent our country well on the world stage, and we couldn’t be prouder of this selection. ” China’s Foreign Ministry did not confirm the report but reacted warmly. “First of all, I would like to say that Mr. Branstad is an old friend of the Chinese people and we welcome him to play a greater role in promoting  . S. relations,” spokesman Lu Kang said at a regular news conference. “The U. S. ambassador to China serves as an important bridge linking the governments of the U. S. and China. We are willing to work with whomever takes this position to strive for the continued, sound and steady development of bilateral ties. ” Branstad met with Trump in New York on Tuesday and issued a written statement saying that he had enjoyed a “very cordial conversation” with the   and that they had spoken about the transition and the next administration. Branstad was among the most active Republican establishment figures backing Trump, campaigning regularly with him in Iowa. The governor’s son, Eric Branstad, managed Trump’s   campaign in Iowa, one of the contested battleground states. Although Trump finished second in the state’s Republican caucuses, he carried the state in the general election with 51 percent of the vote to Hillary Clinton’s 42 percent.      At a rally in Sioux City, Iowa, Nov. 6, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump thanked Iowa leaders, including Gov. Terry Branstad, who Trump said would be ”a prime candidate to take care of China.” (The Washington Post)   Branstad’s move to Beijing, should he be confirmed, would elevate Lt. Gov. Kim Reynolds (R) to the governorship. Reynolds, who has long been considered Branstad’s favored successor, would become Iowa’s first female governor. Under the Obama administration, experts say, the post of ambassador to Beijing had declined somewhat in importance. China policy was largely run out of the White House, with the president tending to immerse himself in many of the details.  Under Trump, the role could be more significant  —   and not only because the next president is likely to leave many of the policy details to his advisers. By taking a phone call from Taiwan’s democratically elected leader and continuing to tweet critical comments about China after his election win, the   has shown he will not be bound by diplomatic convention and wants to show he is standing up to China. Kerry Brown, professor of Chinese studies at King’s College London, said it would be important to have someone in the job who has the president’s ear and can call him up directly. “There’s definitely going to be problems in the first few months, so you need someone who’s going to get direct access to the president and get the president’s attention,” Brown said. “I get the feeling he’s not going to want piles and piles of briefings. He’s not going to wade through that. In a sense, that makes the personal system, where you can have people speak to him directly, very important. ” Branstad, if he is formally nominated by Trump and confirmed by the Senate, could have his work cut out for him trying to smooth over some of the ripples in the relationship  —   notably by reassuring the Chinese that the United States does not want confrontation and conflict andstill sees areas for cooperation. Jie Dalei, an associate professor at the School of International Studies of Peking University, reacted cautiously, saying the appointment could help communication “but is unlikely have too much impact at the   level. ” “At this point, his tweets and remarks certainly have attracted the most attention,” he said. “Compared to that, the appointment of an ambassador to China, though very thoughtful, is unlikely to fix the damage caused by the uncertainty of his tweets and Taiwan call. ” Last month, less than week after Trump’s victory, Branstad paid his seventh visit to China, meeting the country’s agriculture minister as well as officials from Iowa’s sister province, Hebei. He has described Xi as an “old friend” and, during a 2015 interview with state news agency Xinhua, proudly displayed photographs of two meetings with the Chinese leader. The first dated to 1985, when Xi made his first trip to the United States as a young agriculture officer from Hebei. The other was from 2012, when Branstad hosted a dinner at the Iowa Capitol for the   president of China. Branstad also met Xi on a visit to China in 2011. He said the pair spoke for 45 minutes as Xi reminisced about the hospitality he had received when he was in Iowa. The   governor is the   in American history, and his state voted for Trump by the largest margin for a Republican since Ronald Reagan in 1980. Iowa has strong economic ties to China; the state is the largest producer of corn and among the largest soybean producers in the United States. China has been a   market for Iowa’s agriculture and processed food, with exports from the state up by a factor of 13 between 2000 and 2010 to $6. 3 billion, according to Chinese state media. That fact alone may reassure some people that Trump will not start a trade war with China, since retaliation from Beijing in the shape of reduced soybean and corn imports would hurt not only Iowa but also other   agricultural states. Branstad was a vocal backer of the   Partnership, the   trade deal championed by the Obama administration that Trump has pledged to rip up on his first day in office. Branstad said his state’s large agricultural industry would benefit from the accord, boosting exports of pork, corn and poultry and creating jobs. The Obama administration said the TPP, which does not include China, was an important strategic initiative to more firmly link the U. S. economy to the   region as a hedge against China’s growing clout. But Trump denounced the TPP as a threat to American manufacturing workers, and Beijing has touted a rival Asia trade pact that does not include the United States. Branstad, 70, served as governor of Iowa from 1983 to 1999 and again starting in 2011. Trump will visit the state Thursday on his   victory tour. Two days before the Nov. 8 presidential election, during a rally in Sioux City, Trump called the governor to the stage, calling him “our prime candidate to take care of China. ” Denyer reported from Beijing.

","     Two juveniles have been charged with aggravated arson in connection with the East Tennessee wildfires that killed 14 people last week and left nearly 150 others injured, authorities said Wednesday. During an investigation, “information was developed that two juveniles allegedly started the fire,” the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation said in a news release. A petition was filed Wednesday in juvenile court charging the juveniles with aggravated arson, the TBI said. Both were taken into custody Wednesday morning and are being held at the Sevier County Juvenile Detention Center. Additional charges “are being considered,” District Attorney General Jimmy B. Dunn said at a news conference in Sevierville, Tenn. “Everything is on the table. ” The suspects are Tennessee residents, Dunn said. No additional information about the youths was made available, including their age and gender. “I understand that you have a lot of questions,” Dunn told reporters. “However, the law does not allow for the disclosure of additional information at this time. ” The “Chimney Tops 2” fire was first reported Nov. 23 in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park near Gatlinburg, according to the National Park Service. The wildfire exploded on Nov. 28, as massive walls of flames spread down the mountains into Gatlinburg and Pigeon Forge with shocking speed, according to those who fled with little more than the clothes on their backs.      Lt. Steve Coker of the Sevierville Fire Dept. captured video of the wildfires burning in eastern Tennessee as his fire crew moved through the town of Gatlinburg on Nov. 28. (Twitter @alliecoker7)   The fires that engulfed the two tourist towns outside the park and shut down one of the country’s most popular natural attractions left more than 1, 750 structures damaged or destroyed, most of them   residences. Additionally, thousands of wooded acres burned in the   national park in the United States. “To the residents of Sevier County: We stand with you and are committed to making sure justice is served in this case,” TBI Director Mark Gwyn said at the news conference Wednesday. He added: “Our promise is that we will do every effort to help bring closure to those who have lost so much. ” The investigation, Gwyn said, is ongoing. This is a developing story."

","      In “Jackie,” Natalie Portman portrays first lady Jacqueline Kennedy in the days immediately following John F. Kennedy’s assassination. It is a period of glazed grief, profound anxiety and   concern about her late husband’s legacy, which she is shown cementing by choreographing a funeral procession modeled on Abraham Lincoln’s and conducting an interview during which she very deliberately compares the Kennedy era to Camelot. Throughout the film, which opens this week in Washington, writer Noah Oppenheim and director Pablo Larraín pay tribute to Jacqueline Kennedy’s iconic persona, even as they challenge it  . She is portrayed as the figure of superb grace, taste and strength that endeared her to millions of Americans, but also as woman with a shrewd sense of history and symbolism who was far more knowing, even calculating, than her demure public persona suggested.  With its combination of rigorously detailed historical     archival footage and purely speculative fantasy  —   not to mention Portman’s searing physical and psychological performance  —   “Jackie” creates an unsettling, almost hallucinatory mix of fact and fiction. No sooner has Larraín seamlessly transported Portman into Mrs. Kennedy’s 1962 “Tour of the White House” television special than he confects a fantastical montage in which she staggers in a druggy haze through the East Wing, sipping vodka and trying on couture gowns from a life that is rapidly receding into a dim and idealized past. “Jackie,” in other words, is not a   biopic. Rather than reproduce the reassuring image of gentility and glamour we’ve come to associate with Jacqueline Kennedy, it continually undermines that consensus version of one of the 20th century’s most private public figures. Already, some viewers  —   especially baby boomers who came of age during the Kennedy era  —   have announced that they’re not interested in having their view of Jacqueline Kennedy ruined by Larraín’s countermyth. At a recent preview screening at the Avalon Theatre  —   named, appropriately enough, for another Arthurian enclave  —   a handful of viewers could be overheard expressing shock and dismay at being confronted with the fact that Mrs. Kennedy secretly smoked. As unsettling as “Jackie” often is, it’s also a consoling portrait of a time that, especially in this political season, in some ways seems worthy of halcyon legend after all. A week after her husband’s murder, angered by historians and writers who are already challenging his accomplishments, Mrs. Kennedy summons a writer from Life magazine to the Kennedy compound in Hyannis Port to advance her own version of the official narrative. Based on   journalist Theodore White, Billy Crudup’s unnamed author dutifully records Mrs. Kennedy’s dictation, ceding her full editorial control, including revealing erasures (“I don’t smoke,” she insists icily) and the Camelot comparison. As contentious as their conversation is at times, it now seems quaint that there was once as trusted and   a journalistic institution as Life for Mrs. Kennedy to use to connect with her public. Even the political transition to Lyndon B. Johnson’s administration, while certainly fraught, proceeds apace with admirable decorum and gravitas.     (Stephanie   Searchlight)     (Stephanie   Searchlight)    But planted within that fond look back are also the seeds of what was to come, seeds that the Kennedys themselves helped sow, wittingly or not, and that have now come into florid bloom. As figures who occupied the liminal space between politics and pop culture, they arguably presaged a time, 50 years later, when a   star could not just credibly run for president, but win.  Mrs. Kennedy’s invention and adroit deployment of the Camelot myth  —   which took firm hold despite some skeptical howls  —   looks relatively benign when juxtaposed with the fake news and outright falsehoods promulgated by the incoming administration, from   Donald Trump’s unfounded claim that 3 million people voted illegally in November to a virulent hoax involving the Washington pizzeria Comet Ping Pong that resulted in an armed gunman entering the restaurant this past weekend.  Alarmists might suggest that our willingness to indulge artistic liberties on the big screen has inured us to the far more consequential distortions that now plague a “ ” culture. But there’s a crucial difference between creative license and lying. In “Jackie,” Larraín announces his intention to depart from literal truth from the very beginning of the film when we hear the eerie, disorienting chords of Mica Levi’s boldly abstract score. Throughout the movie, through sound, image and Portman’s uncanny performance  —   often captured in claustrophobic,      —   the filmmakers make clear that their goal isn’t to deceive viewers with   “authenticity” but to provoke and challenge our most dearly held assumptions about what counts as authentic at all. Similarly, even the most contested   movies in recent history  —   “JFK,” “Zero Dark Thirty” and “Selma” among them  —   were obviously their authors’ impressions of events rather than raw feeds of the events themselves, if only because they were so clearly and explicitly framed. Everything about the filmgoing experience, from the smell of the popcorn to the size of the screen, conditions us to process what we’re seeing as entertainment  —   and, sometimes, art. We’ve now entered a   space in which the most crucial frames have disappeared. The facts that filmmakers use as fodder for leaps of interpretive imagination are now being routinely warped (or, more commonly, disregarded) in service to the dark arts of demagoguery, with grave    stakes. When Washington Post reporters interviewed purveyors of the Pizzagate conspiracy theory this week, one of them lightheartedly compared it to the same kind of hobbyism practiced by assassination buffs who take “JFK” as gospel; another called his amateur Pizzagate investigation “a work of art. ” Of course, to really appreciate a work of art, one needs critical thinking skills  —   a value embodied in “Jackie” by the title character but one that has been cast aside over years of politicians and pundits fulminating against “historically inaccurate” films while willfully ignoring the growing importance of media literacy, especially in public schools. As “Jackie” reminds us, there might have been a time when Americans relied on consensus history,   facts and shared notions of objective reality to acquit our participatory duties as informed citizens. Today, we’re more apt to pick and choose which narratives to accept, as if we’re deciding which movie we want to see at the multiplex on Friday night. In both equations, what we crave isn’t accuracy as much as fealty to our own   viewpoints, a   easily accommodated by an increasingly balkanized media culture. We’re all on the verge of becoming those ladies at the Avalon, reluctant to allow anyone to mess with our myths. The question is whether the islands we’ve built for ourselves can thrive simply by cultivating our most cherished fictions, while facts as we used to know them wither and die on the vine.

"," Kellyanne Conway, Donald Trump’s campaign manager, orchestrated the presidential election of a man who: ●Boasted on videotape, in vulgar terms, about assaulting women. ●Called women bimbos, pigs, slobs, dogs and hookers, publicly rated their breasts and buttocks and boasted during the campaign about his penis size. ●Won the election with the largest gender gap ever recorded: Not only did he lose women by a dozen points but he won men  —   many of them motivated by the gender resentment of Hillary Clinton  —   by a dozen points, too.  And now, a month after her candidate defeated the first woman ever to be a   presidential nominee  —   Trump called Clinton “shrill” and said her only asset was “the woman card”  —   Conway is playing the woman card herself.      Kellyanne Conway is Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump’s campaign manager  —   but the two aren’t always on the same page. (Peter   Washington Post)   “It’s a great time to be a woman in America,” Conway exulted Wednesday at the Women Rule Summit, a   event in Washington hosted by designer Tory Burch’s foundation, Google and Politico. “We’re a product of our choices, not just our circumstances. We’re independent thinkers. And it’s just a very special time. ” Her message to the audience, many of them young women: Women should “go for it” and “ask for what we think we deserve. ” What Conway is asking for now, after Trump’s win, is to return to a traditional gender role. She doesn’t want a job in the administration, because she wants to have time with her four kids, to help with homework and make meals. “My children are 12, 12, 8 and 7, which is bad idea, bad idea, bad idea, bad idea for mom going inside. ” But fathers of young children? That’s a different matter, she explained. When male colleagues suggested she could have a White House job, “I did politely mention to them that the question isn’t, would you take the job? . . . The real question is, what would your wife do? And would you want the mother of your children to do it?” When she puts it that way, she said, they replied that “they wouldn’t want their wife to take that job. ”  Conway endorsed the aspiration that “I could maybe help America’s women in terms of feeling less guilty about balancing life and career. ” But she seemed to lack   about the choice she made to help elect Trump. She spoke about how she didn’t like the way Clinton and Sarah Palin were treated in the 2008 campaign. “I left the 2008 campaign feeling really icky,” she said. “I had two daughters at the time, now three, and we just can’t feel good about that. It’s great to ask how we’re making opportunities for women, but do we even have each other’s support, frankly, on our way there?” She expressed no such misgivings about Trump’s 2016 run, in which he disparaged Carly Fiorina’s face, said both Clinton and Fiorina gave him headaches, used a vulgar word for female genitalia on the stump and suggested Megyn Kelly’s menstruation played a role in the Fox News personality’s tough questioning of him. He had previously fantasized publicly about a woman giving oral sex,   a Miss Universe and spoke of the importance of having “a young, beautiful piece of ass. ” Politico’s Anna Palmer, as moderator, was gentle in questioning Conway, waiting a   before mentioning the “Access Hollywood” video in which Trump bragged about grabbing women by the crotch. Conway assured everybody that Trump’s apology was “heartfelt,” then went on to say he was faced with a “false accuser” and that Conway “did not think about quitting, for a number of reasons I’ll keep private. ” She said Trump is “a gentleman. ” Outside the room at the Park Hyatt where Conway spoke, a photo booth for the Women Rule conference urged attendees to “tell us what empowers you. ” What empowered Conway on Wednesday was disparaging Trump’s former opponents (Clinton’s “scandalabra” and Tim Kaine’s paltry crowds) and the media for errant predictions of a Clinton victory. By contrast, Conway, like her boss, betrayed a fondness for  . She described her management style as patient, methodical, “tough and firm but gentle at the same time,” honest, candid, “very deferential and respectful,” and “with a big smile. ” But after this ugly campaign, Conway and her boss will need more than a big smile. “I was always raised to respect the office of the presidency and its current occupant,” said the woman whose boss led the campaign questioning the current president’s legitimacy as a   American.  Americans respect the presidency, but Trump will have to earn respect. And you don’t earn that by running a campaign that stirred up misogyny and   resentment  —   and then proclaiming it a victory for women.

","   Cary Nelson is a English professor at the University of Illinois at   and an affiliated professor at the University of Haifa. David Greenberg is a history professor at Rutgers University. They are members of the Alliance for Academic Freedom.       Since 2014, there has been a disturbing surge in the number of invited campus speakers being repeatedly interrupted or actually prevented from delivering a public lecture. A startling share of these silencing efforts have been directed at Israelis or other speakers sympathetic to Israel who have run afoul of the growing   movement on campuses. Behind this spike is an idea called “ . ” This concept, which   organizations began vigorously promoting two years ago, holds that any activities that might “normalize” relations between Israelis and Palestinians  —   from children’s soccer leagues to collaborative environmental projects to university panel discussions with both sides represented  —   should be summarily rejected because they treat both parties as having legitimate grievances and aspirations. Joint projects are to be shunned unless they begin with the premise that Israel is the guilty party. Shouting down speakers  —   including defenders of Israel  —   didn’t start with the adoption of  . But in the past such episodes were regarded as exceptional and scandalous violations of academic freedom. In one of the first of these episodes, in 2010, Michael Oren, a distinguished historian serving as Israel’s ambassador to the United States, tried to give a presentation at the University of California at Irvine, when   students interrupted him with epithets and slogans. He was unable to utter more than a few portions of his remarks at a stretch, although he did ultimately finish the speech. But that incident was widely condemned. Ten protesters were later found guilty of disrupting a speech and ordered to perform community service. Upholders of   rights insisted that at an institution of higher learning, you don’t shout people down; a liberal education requires that all views be given a hearing. And when Oren’s critics countered that Israel’s policies in Gaza and the West Bank placed its defenders beyond the protections of academic discourse, they found themselves in an impossible position.   principles, after all, are either universal or they become politicized and diminished, subject to the whim of those in power. In recent years, however,   has provided a new justification for singling out Israel’s supporters for silencing. For decades, Israel’s detractors struggled in vain to rebut the point that they were unfairly targeting a relatively liberal democracy while ignoring the far worse human rights violations of numerous state and nonstate actors.   offered a convenient principle specific to the   conflict  —   one that could create a rhetorical escape hatch from questions of why, by this logic, defenders of Iran, Saudi Arabia, Russia or China didn’t also deserve to be silenced. As   spread as a tactic, it acquired a higher status. Advocates of BDS  —   the campaign to boycott, divest from and sanction Israel  —   began to grant this “principle” a   character, lending its application to campus events an air of moral urgency and ethical superiority. By last year, BDS supporters had a transcendent reason to voice their contempt for academic freedom when they refused to participate in “normalizing” dialogue about the   conflict and to block campus access to speakers deemed sympathetic to Israel. As a result, such incidents proliferated. In October 2015, former Israeli Supreme Court chief justice Aharon Barak, noted for his support of Palestinian rights, had his own   talk interrupted and curtailed. The following month the   Israeli philosopher and New York University faculty member Moshe Halbertal had a University of Minnesota lecture disrupted. In February, Israeli Arab Bassem Eid was relentlessly heckled by BDS activists at the University of Chicago; in April, they blocked Jerusalem Mayor Nir Barkat from speaking at San Francisco State University.  In other cases,   prompted people to prevent a speech simply because it was   by a Jewish student group. At Brown University in March, the transgender activist Janet Mock canceled a speech after 160   students objected because the campus Hillel chapter was among the sponsors.   speakers have also faced calls to have their invitations rescinded. In 2013, the University of Michigan withdrew an invitation to Pulitzer   novelist Alice Walker, who has compared Israel to Nazi Germany. In 2011, the City University of New York withdrew an honorary degree to playwright Tony Kushner, a fierce critic of Israel, only to quickly reinstate it. These incidents, too, are completely unacceptable, but  —   significantly  —   they were   not the result of a policy espoused by an international campaign. The growing practice of silencing   speakers  —   of denying them the right to be treated as equals in campus debates  —   constitutes a dire threat to academic freedom. In our deeply polarized times, it is more important than ever that universities create opportunities for students and faculty to hear and engage with ideas that they don’t share. Their leaders must defend more vocally than they have thus far the   rights of all speakers on the   conflict. They must do so now, before the shouting down of unpopular views becomes, for lack of a better word, normalized.   Read more here:   Jill S.

Like many Americans who stand for progressive ideals, few young Taiwanese see someone like Donald Trump as a decent leader. However, the anxious reaction of the American media and foreign policy establishment to the Dec. 2 phone call between Taiwan’s President Tsai   and   Trump is also at odds with American values of human rights, freedom and democracy. Sharing these values, we are puzzled why many commentators have treated Trump’s move as an “affront” to authoritarian China rather than consider the possibility of normalizing relations with a democratic nation of 23 million people, many of whom share deep affinities with the United States.

S. pundits rarely skirt controversy for fear of “provoking” China. Why should the rhetoric change when it comes to Taiwan  —   a vibrant young democracy led by a female head of state which boasts universal health care and is poised to become the first place in Asia to legalize   marriage?  Taiwan’s current diplomatic isolation is a legacy of the Cold War. When the Carter administration cut official ties with Taiwan in 1979, the island was still under the rule of an exiled authoritarian regime which claimed itself as the legitimate representative of all of China. Taiwan’s uneven support from American conservatives, who saw Taiwan as a front line against communist China, is partly a result of this history. However, times have changed. Taiwan has democratized and its people are articulating new aspirations which deserve acknowledgment from Americans across the political spectrum.      The Washington Post’s Jia Lynn Yang explains the back story on relations between the U. S. China and Taiwan and the ramifications of Friday’s telephone call between   Donald Trump and Taiwanese President Tsai  . (Alice Li, Victoria   Washington Post)   Earlier this year, Taiwan underwent another peaceful transition of power, and for the first time a   coalition took both the presidency and legislature. This development was partly driven by the 2014 Sunflower Movement, which we participated in. A    occupation of the legislature and a rally of 500, 000 people that drew inspiration from the Occupy Wall Street movement, this was a protest against the collusion of business and political elites who threatened to sacrifice Taiwan’s sovereignty to enrich the 1 percent. This movement, the elections that followed and national opinion polls together demonstrate a new consensus: Taiwan does not claim to represent China, nor is it trying to become a part of China. Rather, we seek increased international space, recognition and dignity. While Taiwan has emerged from decades of authoritarian rule, due to both implicit U. S. practice and explicit Chinese interference, it is still unable to participate in organizations such as the United Nations and the World Health Organization. Despite having the world’s   GDP and a larger population than that of Australia, our flourishing multicultural society is internationally silenced and played as a pawn of superpower politics. It is clear that a single phone call from the U. S.   will not change Taiwan’s diplomatic status. However, the U. S. media response to Trump’s call has thrown Taiwan’s plight into stark relief. Some critics charged Trump with cynically pursuing profits for his hotel empire, which may be attempting to expand into Taiwan. But a new hotel is, as Trump himself might say, “peanuts” compared with Taiwan’s weapons trade with the United States. Trump’s tweets, which implied that Taiwan’s past purchases of billions of dollars of U. S. weapons entitled it to a phone call with the   are no less troubling than these hotel business rumors. If Trump’s chat with President Tsai turns out to be nothing more than a business call, it won’t be a call that many people will get behind. However, it is the very abnormality of American policy that allows such unsubstantiated rumors to circulate and compromise the possibility of transparency or public oversight. A simple phone call with the elected leader of Taiwan has not brought death or destruction. Instead, it has provided an opening, however fraught and imperfect, for a   reconsideration of an unhealthy and anachronistic policy. Dismissing Taiwan’s democracy is not only an affront to Taiwan but to democracy everywhere. Americans  —   liberal, conservative and otherwise  —   would do well to stop using Taiwan as a tool to score political points at home or against China, and instead examine their commitments to human rights, freedom and democracy."

","     THE MORNING PLUM: The emerging GOP plan to repeal Obamacare on a delayed schedule  —   and then maybe kinda sorta replace it later  —   has raised a big question: Will Democrats help Republicans pass a replacement that is far less generous and comprehensive than the health law is, allowing Republicans an escape from the political fallout from repeal? In an interview with me, Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer answered this question with a resounding No. Under no circumstances, he vowed, would Democrats throw Republicans such a political lifeline. “We’re not going to do a replacement,” Schumer said of the Senate Democratic caucus. “If they repeal without a replacement, they will own it. Democrats will not then step up to the plate and come up with a   solution that we will partially own. It’s all theirs. ” This could have   implications for the political battle over the health law that’s set to unfold  —   and indeed for the future of the health care system. Senate Republicans just announced that they will begin the process of repealing most of the health law in January, including the subsidies and Medicaid expansion that have helped cover many millions of previously uninsured people. Republicans are currently arguing over when exactly repeal should kick in  —   conservatives want it to be sooner, while GOP Senate leaders want to defer it to push off the political fallout until after the 2018 elections.  But whenever repeal does kick in, Republicans have insisted, they will have some kind of replacement ready. And here’s where Democrats come in. Republicans appear to be calculating that the looming prospect of millions losing insurance will force Dems to cooperate with them to pass a replacement that covers far fewer people and offers less in consumer protection than the ACA does. (They may need Dems to pass a replacement, because some conservatives may not vote for anything that spends and regulates to expand coverage.) But if Democrats do hold the line against anything far short of the ACA, they may be able to leverage Republicans into replacing it with something that is not nearly as regressive as the GOP replacement might otherwise have been.      Donald Trump has campaigned to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, otherwise known as Obamacare, once he gets into office. Now that he’s won the presidency with a majority Republican House and Senate, that feat might not prove to be too easy. Wonkblog’s Max Ehrenfreund explains. (Daron   Washington Post)   This is what Schumer is now vowing to do. Asked directly if Democrats would refuse to support anything that falls significantly short of the ACA in terms of expanding social welfare, Schumer said: “The odds, after they repeal without any replacement, of us sitting at the table to do something that will chop one arm off instead of two is very small. ” “They’re giving us tremendous leverage,” Schumer insisted. Time, of course, will tell whether Democrats make good on this vow. But it’s worth noting another important factor here: If Republicans do opt for    it could make a big mess very quickly, well in advance of any vote on a replacement, which could make the politics of this even worse for them. As Jonathan Cohn reports today, health experts are predicting that    could cause insurance markets to unravel very quickly. Insurance companies may exit the markets due to the uncertainty of seeing any replacement materialize. They may also pull out because Republicans look likely to repeal the individual mandate while trying to keep the protections for preexisting conditions (which cannot be repealed by a simple majority) which will make the risk pools older and sicker. The overall result could be millions losing coverage and all around chaos. Schumer said that in this scenario, Democrats would not toss Republicans a lifeline. “They broke it, they own it,” Schumer said. “All the problems in the health care system that they blamed on Obamacare will now be in their laps. We’re going to make sure that we say things would have been a lot better, had they been thoughtful and careful and worked with us to fix Obamacare. ”  It’s hard to say for sure how this will all play out. But here’s one possible scenario: Republicans do repeal much of Obamacare; a big mess ensues; Democrats refuse to participate in any vastly substandard replacement; Republicans are unable to pass it; no replacement materializes; and in several years, 20 million fewer people have health coverage. That would be a tremendous lurch backward. But Democrats would try to make Republicans own the outcome and the fallout, and this would all be   once again, heading into the 2020 elections. *************************************************************** * CRITICISM MOUNTS OF TRUMP’S CRAZY, AWFUL NSA PICK: CNN reports that demands are growing louder for Trump to rescind his choice of national security adviser, Mike Flynn, with 53 nonprofit groups demanding he reconsider. Among Flynn’s offenses: He has also spread false stories and     threats. He’s been criticized for dabbling in conspiracy theories and Islamophobia, for his questionable ties to foreign governments and for mishandling classified information while at the DIA, a post he was pushed out of. Other than that, Flynn will be just perfect for the role of talking Trump out of his own penchant for conspiracies and delusions as he makes deeply consequential national security decisions. * TRUMP’S ECONOMIC PROMISES AREN’T GONNA HAPPEN: The New York Times concludes that many of Trump’s economic promises will be very hard to honor. Among them: Preventing American companies from shipping jobs overseas; reviving manufacturing and coal; boosting growth to over 4 percent; and an infrastructure plan that isn’t a privatization scheme. In other words, most of Trump’s main economic planks are unlikely to happen. Of course, the steep tax cuts for the rich and the deregulation of Wall Street will likely end up happening. Shocking that those priorities are the ones that will be realized, isn’t it? * AMERICANS NOT TOO WORRIED ABOUT TRUMP CONFLICTS: A new Bloomberg Politics poll finds that Americans think Trump should keep his roles as businessman and president separate. But: 69 percent believe it goes too far to force him and his family to sell their business empire to avoid conflicts of interest  …    51 percent of those surveyed are very or mostly confident the billionaire businessman will put the nation’s best interests ahead of his family’s finances when he deals with foreign leaders. Oh well. This may only encourage congressional Republicans to abandon even any pretense of oversight. Of course, these numbers might change if and when real scandals come along. * KRIS KOBACH TO HEAD DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY? The Washington Examiner quotes a top transition official familiar with Trump’s thinking who says that Kansas Secretary of State Kric Kobach may be Trump’s pick to head the Department of Homeland Security. If this does happen, Kobach  —   one of the country’s most prominent immigration    —   may implement an agenda that is every bit as cruel and draconian as what Trump promised. Expect revocations of protections for dreamers;   deportations; and a lot more. * TRUMP’S FINANCES WILL REMAIN OPAQUE: Trump now says he sold off his stocks during the campaign, minimizing possible conflicts. But the Post points out this key context: Trump representatives have not provided records of stock transactions or other details since a   filing released in May. Over the past five months, Trump campaign officials gave no indication of the stock sale. Trump has also refused to release his tax returns, which would provide more detailed information about his financial holdings. Congressional Republicans could be raising a fuss about this if they wanted to. But they won’t, so Trump’s finances will remain opaque for the foreseeable future. * TRUMP IS ALL FOR BIG SPENDING ON STIMULUS: Trump has been named Time Magazine’s “Person of the Year,” and in the article we find this quote from him: He has little patience for the organizing principle of the Tea Party: the idea that the federal government must live within its means and lower its debts. Instead, he seems to favor expensive new infrastructure spending and tax cuts as economic stimulus, much like Obama did in 2009. “Well, sometimes you have to prime the pump,” he says. “So sometimes in order to get jobs going and the country going, because, look, we’re at 1% growth. ” Prime the pump! The tea party will surely be as outraged over this as they were over Obama’s stimulus, which was widely cast as a threat to the future of the republic. * AND COAL COUNTRY IS HOPEFUL ABOUT TRUMP: Marc Fisher has a nicely reported piece on how people in West Virginia coal country are deeply euphoric and hopeful about Trump ascending to the presidency. The Mayor of Buckhannon sums it up: “Trump was just what people here have always been  —   skeptical of government, almost libertarian. He’s a West Virginia pipe dream: He’s going to undo the damage to the coal industry and bring back the jobs, and all of our kids down there in North Carolina are going to come home. ” It will be interesting when news organizations revisit coal country in, say, three years to see if Trump has lived up to expectations.

142118,217492,How to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act — responsibly,Washington Post,Marilyn Tavenner,2016-12-07,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161208000747/https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/how-to-repeal-and-replace-obamacare--responsibly/2016/12/07/c392011a-bca3-11e6-91ee-1adddfe36cbe_story.html
","   Marilyn Tavenner is president and chief executive of America’s Health Insurance Plans (AHIP) the national trade association representing the   community.   For all the uncertainty created by November’s elections, one thing is clear: The Affordable Care Act (ACA) is about to undergo significant changes.  It is also clear that certain parts of the ACA have not worked as well as intended, particularly for individuals who buy health insurance on their own. As the new administration and lawmakers develop specific proposals to repeal and transition, it is imperative that they understand: Changes can either begin a stable transition to a better approach, or they can bring about even more uncertainty and instability. Some lawmakers have talked about immediate repeal and waiting years to replace. Others have talked about a stable, secure transition to a workable replacement. That’s what will work for the American people. As a longtime   expert and the leader of a group that represents the nation’s health insurers, let me suggest some straightforward steps that can make this possible.  First, the foundation of effective insurance markets is continuous coverage for everyone  —   those who utilize insurance to obtain quality care and those who are healthy but have insurance to protect them in case they get sick. Both types of consumers must be insured for coverage to remain affordable.  The individual mandate, requiring everyone to have insurance, will likely be removed. However, to continue the reforms that people want  —   such as making certain that those with preexisting health conditions can obtain insurance at an affordable price  —   we need to find alternative ways for people to get and stay covered.  Here’s why: If the majority of individuals purchasing insurance are those who require immediate medical care or have   medical needs, that will undoubtedly raise costs and reduce choices. While there is no single “silver bullet” to ensure that people get and stay covered, we should use proven solutions from Medicare and   employers, such as waiting periods or penalties for those who have had a break in coverage. Such continuous coverage incentives could go a long way to avoiding even higher premiums and fewer choices for everyone. Second, it will be important for Congress and the new administration to send strong signals that they are committed to market stability in 2017 and 2018. Right now, millions of Americans are choosing a private plan for next year  —   and millions more will be covered by Medicaid.  The best approach to keep insurance affordable and markets stable would be to fund temporary, transitional programs. These would include maintaining subsidies for   and   individuals to purchase insurance and financial help for plans that enroll   individuals, through at least Jan. 1, 2019.  There is no question that this funding is contentious. But it is essential to deliver stable plan options and predictable premiums until a replacement plan can be designed, developed and deployed. It can help build an effective bridge from repeal to replace  —   without jeopardizing care and coverage for millions of Americans. Third, Congress could reduce   costs for millions of Americans by eliminating the   tax on insurers. The Affordable Care Act taxes   premiums by more than $100 billion over 10 years, raising costs for seniors on Medicare, state Medicaid programs, small businesses and hardworking families struggling to make ends meet. Eliminating this tax  —   which has already been suspended for 2017  —   will lower premiums that millions of families and businesses pay. Finally, the new administration can take immediate action to bring down costs for consumers by implementing effective verification of individuals’ eligibility before they enroll in an insurance plan. This would help prevent people from waiting to sign up for coverage until they’re sick, then dropping it when they’re better  —   which raises costs for everyone.  Americans deserve affordable coverage that works. The individual insurance market was a challenge before the ACA and continues to be one today. Whether citizens are covered through their employer or on their own, through Medicare or Medicaid, our commitment is to find solutions that deliver   stability and   improvement. Both are essential if repeal and replace is going to work.   Read more here:    Henry J. Aaron and Robert D.

","     We have been chatting informally since Election Day with new and veteran lawmakers, philanthropic organizations, think tanks and longtime political operatives on both sides of the aisle. While unnerved by the election of a demagogic populist and queasy about its implications for democratic institutions, public discourse and America’s place in the world, no one in the few dozen we have spoken with at length is throwing up his or her hands, heading for the backwoods or declaring that the United States is finished. From all of these voices some major themes emerged: 1. Right and left must end their sworn allegiance to economic determinism. Democrats insisted that economic progress would induce workers to vote for a third Obama term. Both Democrats and Republicans thought that employed,   Americans outside the Rust Belt would abandon Donald Trump in droves; they didn’t. Liberals, conservatives and especially libertarians missed a truism: People are not always rational and are not purely economic beings. They look for a sense of community, status, recognition and a host of intangible rewards. A few smart voices, such as the American Enterprise Institute’s Arthur Brooks, have recognized that “an acute crisis has been rolling through   America. ” He explains: There is indeed a gap in this country, and it has now led to a political revolution, a significant realignment in American politics. But the relevant gap wasn’t income. It was dignity.   …     What precisely did Mr. Trump offer these voters? Snake oil, say critics. Most economists predicted that policies built on Mr. Trump’s   and antitrade rhetoric would hardly help unemployed,   people in places like Kentucky and West Virginia. But where these experts heard incoherent specifics, many voters heard a consistent deeper theme: A promise to work hard at restoring   Americans’ dignity by bringing back jobs and striking back at the cultural elites who disdain them. We can reject Trump’s message of xenophobia, sexism and racism and the urge from populists to infantilize white,   voters as helpless victims. We are left, however, with an acute need to cultivate a sense of belonging  —   to nation, community and shared values.        Donald Trump announced that a Japanese bank, Softbank, ”has agreed to invest $50 billion in the United States, and 50, 000 jobs.” Trump met with Masayoshi Son, the CEO of SoftBank, at Trump Tower Tuesday. (Video: The Washington  : Jabin   Washington Post)   2. Government likely won’t get better, so look elsewhere. Trump might be crazy like a fox  —   or he might be crazy and completely incapable of governance. Nevertheless, he presents us with the opportunity not only to rebalance power between the executive and legislative branches and between the federal and state governments, but between the public and private sector. The latter includes philanthropy, civil society and business. We all have looked too frequently to the government for fixes and mandates; now is the time to look to voluntary efforts, persuasion and advocacy aimed directly at business. (One silver lining to Trump’s election: An outpouring of donations and volunteer offers to charitable and public advocacy groups.) Two items caught our attention. First, Ikea announced it “will now offer up to four months paid parental leave to its U. S. workers of all genders, whether they’re salaried or hourly  —   and irrespective of whether they’re becoming parents via birth, adoption, or fostering. The move, announced on Tuesday, sets IKEA apart from its peers in the U. S. retail sector. ” Second, the Human Rights Campaign announced Monday: The nation’s major companies and law firms are advancing in record numbers vital policies and practices to protect lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer (LGBTQ) workers around the world, according to the 2017 Corporate Equality Index released. . . . The Corporate Equality Index (CEI) launched in 2002 to assess   policies and practices at Fortune 500 companies, also highlights how corporate leaders are increasingly stepping up to play a leading role in opposing   legislation  —   from statehouses to the U. S. Capitol. Through their actions, taken as LGBTQ workers and customers have been facing a record number of   bills in state legislatures across the country, business leaders are building on their longstanding commitment to expanding workplace equality for LGBTQ people. This year, a   517 businesses earned the CEI’s top score of 100, up from 407 last year. That’s a   increase of more than 25 percent   …     Leadership demonstrated by these businesses, including speaking out against discriminatory laws like North Carolina’s HB2, reflect more than a decade of work inside these companies to expand LGBT, and particularly transgender, workplace equality. All this was accomplished without extortion or gifts from the  . Philanthropic groups,   researchers, advocacy groups, labor and other   actors can stimulate business leaders’ enlightened  . Certainly there is a role for government and for compulsory rules, but so long as government remains dysfunctional, why not go directly to the source (e. g. all the Fortune 500 companies)? Truth be told, the worse government becomes, the more responsibility the private sector will need to assume for education, R&D and even promoting social cohesion. It’s hard to do business when your city is racked by racial tension, your employees cannot afford to buy their employers’ own products or populist fury is demanding we throw up trade barriers and stem the tide of immigration. 3. We need massive civic education. If we learned anything in the 2016 election, it is that a slick charismatic figure can trash the First Amendment, threaten all sorts of unconstitutional actions, incite violence and appeal to naked prejudice with nary a peep from the majority of voters. In fact, the more disrespectful of our democratic institutions and civil liberties Trump became, the louder they cheered. Part of this can be written off as appalling hypocrisy from “constitutional conservatives” and   leaders, but Trump capitalized on a vast wasteland of civic ignorance. There is a felt need for civic education not only in the schools but also for adults. Sen. Ben Sasse ( .) hit the nail on the head at a   forum recently when he reminded the audience that “America was an idea that was about something much bigger than what tribe you come from.   …     Government is a means to an end. And our government is a smaller issue than the American idea that is that set of things and truth claims that we believe about human dignity that unite us. And, right now, we have not been having that conversation for 50 years. ” (As an example, he pointed out that 41 percent of people younger than 35 told pollsters that “the First Amendment is dangerous because you might say things with your freedom of speech that hurt somebody else’s feelings. Actually, that’s the whole point of America. That we can say things that hurt each other’s feelings, because we believe so much in the dignity of the other person that we want to persuade them or be persuaded by them. ”) Perhaps if he does not get the secretary of state gig, Mitt Romney can lead a massive public campaign, organize local Constitution clubs, inspire think tanks and cajole lawyers and courts to teach fellow citizens about America’s foundational values  —   respect for the rule of law, equality before the law, the right of   and expression, etc. 4. The sane center has to be supported. If the left goes the way of democratic socialists and the right in the direction of European national front parties, we are going to need a coalition from   to   to support democratic norms and reasoned proposals for education, criminal justice and immigration reform. That can be fostered by supporting   in both parties (as No Labels does) joint policy initiatives between think tanks from different ideological perspectives (e. g. the   report on poverty) and, where possible, bipartisan legislative action (e. g. on combating opioid abuse and human trafficking). Would it have been better to elect a prepared, stable and intellectually coherent president? Sure, but in the meantime, there is plenty of good work to be done."

","  BEIRUT  —   Syrian government forces swept through the Old City of Aleppo on Wednesday as rebel forces  —   besieged and facing certain defeat  —   debated when to withdraw from their shattered stronghold. The army and allied militiamen now hold   of east Aleppo, four years after the area fell from government control.    The accelerating rebel collapse came as Secretary of State John F. Kerry and Russian Foreign Minister met in Hamburg, Germany, for yet another last ditch effort to agree on conditions that would allow the city to be evacuated. Lavrov emerged after just over an hour, saying he had to leave for another appointment. Kerry told reporters that the two had “obviously talked about the extraordinarily dire situation in Aleppo, and we exchanged some ideas about it and we intend to reconnect in the morning to see where we are. ” Asked before the meeting if Russia would support a   Lavrov told reporters as the meeting began that he had agreed “to support American proposal of the second of December. ” In a meeting between the two last Friday, Kerry proposed the safe departure of civilians and thousands in the   “moderate opposition,” leaving behind the    group that Russia and Syria insist is the target of their attacks.   When the rebels balked at the deal, Russia said it assumed it was of the table, but Lavrov agreed to meet with Kerry here, where both are attending a meeting of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. The militants themselves are at loggerheads over what to do next. On Wednesday, they called for a     to allow civilians, including an estimated 500 people in need of medical evacuation, to leave for the countryside north of the city.     But officials within the armed opposition, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said a much broader agreement was in the cards involving full withdrawal from what was once their most important stronghold. Activists said dozens of rebels had already fled. In 2012, the capture of east Aleppo was seen as one of the rebels’ biggest victories. It turned out to be a fatal overstretch, making this final confrontation for the former commercial capital inevitable. The eastern districts have been under siege since July while Syrian and Russian warplanes have launched rounds of bombardment, killing hundreds of civilians and destroying hospitals that treated the wounded.  More than 730 people have been killed in Aleppo since the start of a Nov. 15 government offensive and 80, 000 have fled, the Syrian Observatory added Wednesday.  Repeated government warnings  —   sent via text message or printed on airdropped leaflets  —   have urged residents to leave, warning that those who stay would be “annihilated. ” In comments published Wednesday, the Syrian president said victory in the Aleppo would be a “huge step” toward the end. But it comes at a huge cost. Thousands of civilians have been killed, and the recaptured districts lie in ruins, their apartment blocks shredded and infrastructure destroyed.  History has also been erased. The 14th century Old Souk has burned, and at the Umayyad Mosque, metal spikes twist out where a minaret once stood. Inside what remains of the rebel enclave, there is a growing humanitarian crisis. Amid blistering bombardment, thousands of residents displaced by the offensive now shelter inside abandoned apartment blocks.  Food has almost run out, and fuel stocks are so low that rescue workers say they are often unable to reach the wounded. Photographs from the area Wednesday showed several bodies piled outside a hospital.  “Even by Syrian standards, the recent bombardment and shelling have been the most intense in Aleppo,” said Hanaa Singer, UNICEF’s representative in Syria, in an emailed statement Wednesday. Yet many civilians fear for the future for the future that awaits them with a government victory.  The Syrian war has killed almost half a million people and spurred the greatest refugee crisis since World War II. It has also become a proxy battleground for geopolitical rivals. While Iran and Russia have kept Assad afloat, the United States, Turkey and the Persian Gulf states have offered varying degrees of support to groups that took up arms against the government in 2011. In recent months, that knotty diplomacy has focused mostly on stanching the crisis in Aleppo.  On Monday, Russia and China vetoed a U. N. Security Council resolution calling for a   truce in Aleppo. It was the sixth time that Moscow has blocked U. N. Action on Syria. President Obama and the leaders of Germany, France, Britain, Canada and Italy on Wednesday signed a public statement saying they “condemn the actions of the Syrian regime and its backers, especially Russia,” for the Aleppo attacks and their refusal to allow humanitarian aid into the city and other besieged areas of Syria. The Western leaders called on both Syria and Russia to agree to a plan proposed by the United Nations for a   humanitarian aid and talks on a transition government between the opposition and Assad. France will host a meeting in Paris on Saturday for opposition supporters from Europe and the Middle East; Kerry will attend. The leaders’ statement came after Russia and China on Monday vetoed a U. N. Security Council resolution calling for a   truce in Aleppo. It was the sixth time that Moscow has blocked U. N. Action on Syria. The multiple plans and proposals reflect both international desperation and rebel indecision. In response, Russia has displayed indignation at being accused of human rights violations and accused Washington and its allies of being unable to control the opposition forces they back.        Moscow has tried to sideline Washington’s efforts by sending representatives for talks with rebel officials in Turkey. Col. Abo Bakr, a Free Syrian Army representative present at negotiations, said a provisional deal, including a   and the withdrawal of    militants, was agreed to before talks fell apart as government troops continued their sweep through the city. “It became clear the Russians were procrastinating. They weren’t really negotiating, they were buying time and waiting for the military situation on the ground to become irreversible,” Bakr said.  The Kremlin confirmed Wednesday that a Russian military adviser in Aleppo died of wounds sustained in a rebel mortar attack. It was the third Russian fatality in Syria this week. As   forces moved in on the rebels’ final enclave, civilians there said they had nowhere left to run. In their voice messages, explosions crackled in the background. And when asked if they were safe, residents repeated the same words: “I’m alive. ”  DeYoung reported from Hamburg. Andrew Roth in Moscow and Zakaria Zakaria in Istanbul contributed to this report.        "

","  PEARL HARBOR, Hawaii  —     years after Japanese warplanes streaked over the hills here, laid waste to the harbor, and forced the United States into the cataclysm of World War II, thousands gathered on a placid Wednesday morning to pay tribute to those who died that day. Many assembled on a covered pier that jutted near the spot where remnants of the USS Arizona rest just beneath the surface, unmoved since it was shattered by enemy bombs on the morning of Dec. 7, 1941, killing 1, 177 sailors and Marines. Those in attendance came from across the country  —   including wrinkled old men from small towns, who as young men had been here and still choke up at the memory of lost shipmates. “We lived through it, came home, got married, had children and grandchildren and great grandchildren, and lived a big life,” Louis Conter, 95, who had been on the Arizona, said the day before. “They lost theirs immediately, and they’re the ones that should be called heroes,” he said.

(Photo by Kent   Images) (Kent   Images)  The dignitaries assembled on   Kilo Pier around sunrise, just about the time the first wave of 350 enemy planes from six aircraft carriers attacked that Sunday morning, sinking the battleships Arizona and USS Oklahoma and crippling a dozen other vessels.  The attack also destroyed planes and buildings in the area, and killed about 2, 400 people. Eleven hundred were wounded. In some ways, Wednesday morning was like the one 75 years ago, with ships tied up, and the sun turning the scattered clouds a pinkish blue. And, like that day, it was hard to imagine so violent an attack in such a peaceful spot. There was moment of silence during the proceedings, broken by a flyover of roaring Air Force fighter jets, and the mournful horn of a guided missile destroyer that glided by, a huge American flag waving in salute. All week, the community has been filled with visitors here to remember the day of “infamy,” as President Franklin D. Roosevelt called it. Some on Wednesday wore   emblazoned with pictures of individual survivors, and the names of ships they served on. The Navy’s Pacific Fleet Band, clad in white, played marches  —   an act reminiscent of the bands that were playing aboard ships as the attack began in 1941. Pearl Harbor survivors have been thronged with people eager to express gratitude, grab a selfie and hear their stories.   waited in a long line to have Don Stratton, 94, of Colorado Springs, sign copies of his new memoir, “All the Gallant Men. ” Stratton, one of only a handful of Arizona survivors left, was terribly burned on the battleship and escaped by climbing hand over hand across a rope that someone had thrown from a neighboring vessel. “I don’t know how I made it,” he said. “But I’m here. It was quite a day. ”  “I got a lot of shipmates out there,” he said Tuesday, referring to the wreck in the harbor, as he sat in a USS Arizona ball cap at a   table at the National Park Service site here. He owed them a salute of honor, “and I’m here to do that,” he said.  Visitors also crowded around James DeWitt, 95, of Culver, Ind. as he sat in his wheelchair at the Park Service site. He had been aboard the USS Antares, a supply ship that was towing a barge into Pearl Harbor, when the attack began.  “We [weren’t] going very fast, and we didn’t have an armament,” he said.  But the Antares spotted a Japanese submarine trying to sneak into the harbor, raised an early alarm and was later assailed by enemy planes. DeWitt was 20 in 1941. He had joined the Navy in 1939. The Antares had been at sea for 37 days and was just arriving at Pearl Harbor  —   “two and a half hours ahead of the Japanese,” he said. “We never did get into the harbor. ” He said he could see the smoke in the harbor from the first wave of attacking planes, and then the Antares, itself, became a target in the second attack, he said. “There were eight of us on the bow of the ship . . . and somebody yells. . . . And we hit the deck. About that time, they opened fire. . . . But they were shooting at the bridge, thank goodness. ” He said he saw an enemy plane fly by. Asked what it looked like, he said, “Well, I didn’t get too much time to look at it. . . . You could see the orange ball [insignia] under the wings. ” Conter, of Grass Valley, Calif. told reporters Tuesday of his last minutes on the Arizona, as the fires consumed the forward part of the ship and it gradually went under. “We stayed on the after end, and pulled bodies and people out of the fire,” he said. “They were coming out of the fire. We laid them down on deck, and were putting them on boats to get them to the hospital. “After about 40 minutes, we were getting water on the quarter deck up to our knees,” he said. An officer ordered “abandon ship,” he said. “We took what bodies we had, and what people we had, into the motor launch. We got them to the hospital. “We came back, and fought the fire until Tuesday, before we got off,” he said. “It burned for three days. ” The Japanese launched the surprise attack, hoping they could cripple U. S. forces in the Pacific, as they expanded their Asian empire. The remnants of the sunken Arizona, spanned by a white memorial arch, now rest adjacent to USS Missouri, the huge battleship on which the official Japanese surrender took place in 1945. The Arizona, begun in 1914, and the Missouri, begun in 1941, were both built in the Brooklyn Navy Yard and were both state of the art in their day. Now they are together, one sunk, one afloat, marking the beginning and the end of World War II for the United States and the men and women who served in it. "

","         Ohio lawmakers passed a bill late Tuesday that would prohibit abortion as soon as a fetal heartbeat can be detected  —   at around six weeks, before many women realize they are pregnant.    Ohio Gov. John Kasich (R). (John  )  If Gov. John Kasich (R) signs the bill, it would pose a direct challenge to Supreme Court decisions that have found that women have a constitutional right to abortion until the point of viability, which is typically pegged around 24 weeks. Similar bills have been blocked by the courts. Because of this, even many antiabortion advocates have opposed such measures. But some Ohio Republicans said they were empowered to support the bill because of   Donald J. Trump’s pledge to appoint Supreme Court justices who would overturn Roe v. Wade, the 1973 high court decision that legalized abortion nationally.  “New president, new Supreme Court justice appointees, change the dynamic,” state Senate President Keith Faber (R) told   after the vote. Asked if he believed it could withstand a constitutional challenge, he replied he felt “it has a better chance than it did before. ” There is one vacancy on the Supreme Court, left by Antonin Scalia, a conservative justice who died this year. Another conservative justice in his place would not likely change the dynamics of the court enough to alter the chances for such a bill. But that could change if Trump gets the opportunity during his term to appoint a replacement for one of the more liberal justices. The vote is the latest sign that Trump’s election has energized conservatives on cultural matters, even as his campaign was built around an economic message. Social conservatives were heartened by his choice for vice president, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence (R) who shepherded some of the nation’s strictest laws in his state. They have watched approvingly as his cabinet picks have almost uniformly been outspoken against abortion rights. Previous attempts to ban abortion at such an early point in pregnancy have been unsuccessful. The Supreme Court earlier this year declined to revisit lower court decisions blocking a   abortion ban passed in North Dakota and a   abortion ban in Arkansas. Other states have considered such measures but shelved them because of concerns from   advocates that they would be found unconstitutional, further cementing the right to terminate a pregnancy. Kasich, who has described himself as “” has previously said he is concerned about potential litigation stemming from such a measure. He has not commented on this legislation since it passed. Once the bill reaches his desk he has 10 days, not counting holidays and Sundays, to veto the bill. Abortion rights groups immediately condemned the measure, including how it was passed: As a   amendment to an unrelated bill. They said it contains no exceptions for rape or incest. And they noted that the Ohio legislature is set to vote on another abortion restriction, one that would ban the procedure at 20 weeks of pregnancy. “Make no mistake  —   these bills punish women,” Dawn Laguens, executive vice president of Planned Parenthood Action Fund, said in a statement. “We call on Governor John Kasich to veto these unconstitutional abortion bans. ”      Battles over abortion restrictions are sweeping the globe, from the United States and El Salvador to Northern Ireland and Poland. Here’s a look at where different countries stack up in terms of abortion access. (Jenny   Washington Post)   "

","         In the video, they were all clutching firearms of various caliber. Pistols and shotguns hung frozen in the air, their blunt ends aimed at various people, who remained as still as, well, mannequins. One man was prostrate under the back of a car, as if for cover, the barrel of his shotgun peeking out. Another hid behind a plastic trash can, flimsy protection if this were a real battle. From one angle, it appeared to be a Madame Tussauds Wax Museum exhibit  —   a reenacted   gunfight in rural Alabama involving at least 19 guns and 22 young men, frozen in time, scored by the pulsating beat of pounding rap music. It was a version, albeit an edgy and ultimately inadvisable one, of the mannequin challenge  —   that Internet craze of filming a scene of   people, generally with the song “Black Beatles” by Rae Sremmurd playing over it. It has become so popular that everyone from Taylor Swift to NFL players to Alabama inmates have recorded a version. Those inmates might be able to film a version with a larger cast now, as two of the men in the   mannequin challenge have, perhaps unsurprisingly, been arrested; one of them for  —   you guessed it  —   possessing guns.    Terry Brown and Kenneth White (Courtesy Madison County Jail)  The video was filmed in Huntsville, Ala. but Facebook allowed it to reach those far beyond the borders of the     city. Posted about a month ago on Nov. 9, it has been shared more than 85, 000 times, AL. com reported, meaning it reached a lot of eyeballs. Including those of the Madison County Sheriff’s office, who likely wondered if those 19 guns were accompanied by the proper licenses and permits. Given that the house was caught on film, police investigated further and eventually got a search warrant for the property on Powell Drive in Huntsville. “At 5:02 this morning,” Capt. Mike Salomonsky said in a news conference on Tuesday. “The Madison County Sheriff’s Office SWAT team, the City of Huntsville Police Department SWAT team, and also ATF were present when we executed the search warrant at that residence. ” He said they used a “breaching technique which caused the front door to be removed from the residence,” along with using various diversion devices within the house. Inside, they found a lawman’s gold mine. Police confiscated two handguns, one assault rifle and a   shotgun, a tactical vest and many rounds of ammunition and multiple magazines to boot, Salomonsky said. Along with that, they found several bags of marijuana, packed for resale, and a grinder, which is used to grind the plant’s thick buds into a powdery substance for individual consumption.   Capt.

His bond was set at $30, 000. They also arrested    Terry Brown for possession of drug paraphernalia, loitering and promoting prison contraband. The latter charge stemmed from Brown arriving to prison with marijuana on his person, according to Salomonsky. His bail was set at $3, 800. It is unclear at this time if either man has a lawyer or has entered a plea. More arrests may be imminent. “There are several persons in the video who may be convicted felons,” Salomonsky said. “So, we’re going to try to do some identification, work with the ATF and see if we can generate any charges out of that. ” It’s unclear if the mannequin challenge can be won, but these gentlemen have offered evidence it can be lost.

","         Everything in the lab gleams. There is no smell and no sound but the insectlike whir of the machine that pumps nitrogen gas into the dozen or so glass storage tanks lining the walls. The pressure of the gas inflates the white rubber gloves attached to the tanks and makes them reach, ghostlike, toward the center of the room. The National Museum of Natural History’s support center in Suitland, Md. contains some of the rarest and most precious objects owned by the American people: 17, 000 rocks. They represent the bulk of the nation’s Antarctic meteorite collection, an assortment that includes pieces of other planets, shrapnel from the collisions that shaped the solar system, rubble older than anything on Earth and crystals possibly older than the sun. Retrieved from the bottom of the world and stored for decades in inert nitrogen gas, the collection offers clues to some of the biggest mysteries of existence. “Each meteorite is a piece of the bigger puzzle about how our solar system formed,” said Cari Corrigan, the Smithsonian geologist who oversees the collection. “They can tell us where we came from. ” Shuffling around the lab in a white gown, hair net and blue cloth bootees (you can’t do anything but shuffle in bootees) Corrigan looks like a grim character in “The Andromeda Strain”  —   until she runs down the row of tanks and   the rubber gloves sticking out of them. She fits her hands in a pair of gloves, reaches inside a tank, pulls a tub off a shelf, passes it through the air lock, then yanks open the door. Sifting through the meteorites, each encased in its own protective plastic bag, Corrigan explains what they indicate about the origins of our world.    Cari Corrigan examines a meteorite in the NMNH clean room. (Gillian   Washington Post)  The oldest rocks are chondrites  —   meteorites that clumped together in the swirl of dust and gas that surrounded the sun as the planets began to form. Some include pale flecks called “calcium aluminum inclusions” that are thought to be the most primitive substances in the solar system  —   some of their crystals may predate the sun. At a venerable 4. 5 billion years old, chondrites are as old as our planet and substantially older than anything else on it. Tectonic activity on Earth means that most material is churned back into the interior before it gets too old  —   the most ancient rock known to science was formed 4 billion years ago. These space rocks offer insight into the conditions that created our planet that can’t be found anywhere else on Earth. Iron meteorites come from the heavy cores of asteroids or   planets. The smallest of these have the surprising heft of a paperweight; the larger ones feel like a cannon ball.   “People study these to figure out what’s going on at the center of the Earth,” Corrigan said. “We are never going to get samples from the core of the Earth,”  —   no human drilling operation has even gotten halfway through the crust to the mantle  —   but these are the next best thing. Corrigan specializes in the rocks that result from collisions between asteroids, planets and other bits of space junk. The melt patterns on these meteorites hint at a period called the “Late Heavy Bombardment,” 3. 9 billion years ago, when a mysterious gravitational disturbance swung through the solar system and sent rocky bodies slamming into each other with cataclysmic results. Rarest of all are meteorites from other, known bodies in our solar system, like the moon and Mars. “It’s like it’s own planetary mission every time we get one of those,” Corrigan said. “You can learn what the climate was like, the temperature, the history of the surface . .. all from one rock you can hold in your hand. ”    TOP: Antarctic Search for Meteorites scientists recover meteorite samples from the Miller Range of the Transantarctic Mountains. BOTTOM: The sterile ice fields of Antarctica are among the best places on Earth to search for meteorites. (NASA)  Though meteorites fall all over the planet  —   on cities, on deserts, on cars, on the hips of women asleep on their couches  —   Antarctica is far and away the best place to look for them. The flow of ice across the continent sweeps the rocks into piles. Meanwhile, the cold, dry conditions keep the rocks pristine. “When the only things around you are white snow and blue ice, and then you see that black and brown rock, it’s exciting,” said Corrigan, who has spent two field seasons working on the frozen continent with the Antarctic Search for Meteorites (Ansmet). “You’re the first person ever to see a piece of another planet. ” Twenty years ago this August, NASA scientists announced a “startling discovery”: A Martian meteorite collected near the Antarctic coast held small structures that looked like the fossilized forms of tiny microbes. It also contained organic molecules that are almost always the result of biological processes. The rock was named Allan Hills 84001 for the spot (Antarctica’s Allan Hills) and year (1984) in which it was found. Encased in a glass sphere that Corrigan stores in a   black briefcase, the small, dark rock is among the Ansmet’s most precious finds. It formed during the first few hundred thousand years of Mars’s history, was blasted off the surface during an impact 16 million years ago and fell to Earth at the end of the last ice age. It sat unnoticed in the meteorite collection for years, until scientists realized it came from Mars. Then geologist Dave McKay spotted the strange, wormlike structures buried in the rock. “Today, Rock 84001 speaks to us across all those billions of years and millions of miles,”   Bill Clinton said at a news conference the day of NASA’s announcement. “It speaks of the possibility of life. If this discovery is confirmed, it will surely be one of the most stunning insights into our universe that science has ever uncovered. ”    Allan Hills 84001 (NASA)  Corrigan, then a graduate fellow at NASA’s Johnson Space Center, witnessed the tense excitement that gripped the space community. This was the kind of discovery that many scientists spend their lives dreaming about, sure to win a Nobel Prize and change the world. And, taken together, the lines of evidence defined by the researchers made a compelling case for life. But there was no unequivocal confirmation that living beings once dwelled in the rock. It ran up against the scientific truism that “extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. ” Did NASA really have the extraordinary evidence required? It didn’t. One by one, each of the lines of evidence thought to point to life inside Allan Hills 84001 were refuted. The structures that looked like microfossils might have been introduced when the meteorite was treated in the lab or they could have been caused by chemical reactions with no life required. The organic compounds embedded in the rock could have come from the exhaust of the snowmobiles the original collectors were driving. Within a decade, scientists had more or less settled the issue: the odd forms inside the meteorite almost certainly are not Martians. But they were left with a new question  —   one that many researchers had not previously considered: If a meteorite containing Martians did fall to Earth, would we even recognize them as such? “You could argue that the whole field of astrobiology came out of this,” Corrigan said, gesturing toward the unlikely chunk of rock secured inside its glass case. Partly in response to the Allan Hills debate, biologists and planetary scientists began working together to figure out how organisms could live on Mars and what they might look like. In 1999, NASA’s Mars Global Surveyor began mapping the planet and found suggestions of liquid water on its surface. It was followed by Spirit, Opportunity and Curiosity, rovers whose mission was to seek out signs of habitability on the Red Planet. Closer to home, biologists began to find more and more organisms living in the darkest caves, the depths of the oceans, wisps of cloud and newly formed rocks still hot from the planet’s interior. There may not have been organisms in Allan Hills 84001, but they were almost everywhere else on Earth. “It opened up so many new questions and lines of study we didn’t even know existed then,” Corrigan said. “You can do a study and have it not necessarily be correct in the end . .. but you end up changing the face of science. ” In November, six of Corrigan’s colleagues headed to Antarctica for their 40th season of meteorite collecting. Bundled up against the wind and brutal cold, they’ll spend weeks out on the ice, scouring the blue and white landscape for tiny bits of black. They go back year after year, retrieving rock after rock, because there’s no knowing which one will be the next to change everything. Or perhaps, like Allan Hills, that rock is already sitting in the Smithsonian’s collection, locked in a tank and preserved in nitrogen, waiting for someone to reach in and grab it.

","  SEOUL  —   Opposition lawmakers in South Korea are pressing ahead with their plan to impeach President Park   Friday, but the embattled leader, after saying she would resign if the parliament demanded it, is digging in.  Park is at the center of a corruption and   scandal that is astounding even by South Korean standards. She is under intense political and public pressure to step down, with her approval rating at 4 percent and hundreds of thousands of South Koreans taking to the streets each weekend to demand her resignation, with another rally planned for Saturday. Opposition lawmakers plan to bring a motion Friday, the last day the National Assembly meets this year, and are confident they will win enough support from representatives in Park’s ruling Saenuri party to cross the   majority needed to impeach the president. If the motion succeeds, it will go to the Constitutional Court for approval, which could take six months, but Park will be suspended immediately and the prime minister will take over. Park met with leaders of the Saenuri party Tuesday and signaled that she would not step down until the court had ruled, meaning this political paralysis could drag on for months. “President Park said that even if an impeachment motion is passed as planned, she is determined to calmly and solemnly move forward for the nation and people as she watches the adjudication process of the Constitutional Court,” Chung   Saenuri’s floor leader in the National Assembly, told local reporters after the meeting.   South Korean President Park   bows during an address to the nation at the presidential Blue House in Seoul on Nov. 29. (Jeon   )  With the political crisis coming to a head, some South Koreans are wondering if the country is arriving at a turning point similar to the one it experienced almost 30 years ago. After mass protests across the nation in 1987, the   government agreed to democratic overhauls that included holding direct presidential elections. Maybe this moment is not as momentous as the change from military dictatorship to democracy, but it feels like an opportunity to make the   next leap, analysts say. “During the last three decades, we’ve made remarkable progress in terms of economic development and human rights,” said Kang   a political science professor at Seoul National University. “But many people think we’re now at a crossroads. We haven’t found the leadership to lead the country to a more promising future. ”   South Korea made an astonishing transformation from a poor, agrarian nation in 1960s to the rich,   powerhouse it is today. This metamorphosis was driven by the current president’s father, military strongman Park   whose government support for conglomerates such as Samsung and Hyundai not only powered industrialization but also forged the bond between politics and business that endures today. But there is now a sense of stagnation. The big companies are facing challenges  —   exemplified by the way Samsung Electronics had to cancel its Galaxy Note 7 smartphone because it kept catching fire. Hanjin, one of the world’s biggest shipping lines, collapsed in August amid falling demand in a slowing global economy and has filed for bankruptcy. Young Koreans complain about a   society where those born with a “golden spoon” in their mouths get into the best universities and secure the plum jobs, while those born with a “dirt spoon” work long hours in   jobs without benefits.   Protesters hold candles during a rally against South Korean President Park   in Seoul on Dec. 3. (Jung     Images)  “Many people want a breakthrough to help overcome such trying questions,” Kang said.  This sense of unfairness is one of the key factors that has been sending people here out onto the streets to call for Park’s resignation. Every president since democratization has become embroiled in some kind of bribery debacle. But this time is different. Those scandals were centered on relatives  —   usually brothers and sons  —   of the presidents. This one is focused directly on the president herself. After campaigning on the theme that she was incorruptible  —   she has no children and is estranged from her siblings  —   it has emerged in recent months that Park had been taking advice from a secret confidante on everything from North Korea policy to her wardrobe. The confidante, Choi   a lifelong friend and daughter of a shadowy cult leader, used that relationship to enrich herself to the tune of at least $70 million and get advantages for her family, prosecutors say. One of the country’s leading universities apparently bent its admission rules to allow Choi’s daughter in. To explain the anger to an American audience, Kim   the host of a hugely popular political podcast, explains it this way: “Imagine how angry and betrayed [Donald] Trump’s supporters would be if they found out that he was gay, Muslim and broke at the same time. How would his supporters react if everything they believed in him turned out to be false?”  This situation could have a silver lining, said Lee   a professor of international relations at Yonsei University who served as Park’s ambassadorfor international security affairs. “There is a growing clamor for real political reform, real generational change and cleaner politics,” he said. Changing the constitution to allow presidents to serve two   terms would be a good start. Since democratization, presidents have been limited to a single   term, a provision meant to guard against a return to authoritarian rule. But it has also had the effect of turning presidents into lame ducks after two years. There is universal support for making this change but disagreement on how to do it. Some ruling party lawmakers are now pushing the idea of constitutional restructuring as a solution to the current crisis, allowing Park, who was elected in 2013, to bow out early as it makes the change to a   term. But the opposition parties want Park out before they begin negotiations on constitutional change. Some analysts say the whole system needs retooling to make the president less powerful and to overhaul the political party structure, which sees parties coming and going every election. The current crisis is the result of conflicting views held by the citizens living in the 21st century and a political class stuck in a   style of ruling, said Kim, the podcaster, whose weekly program is called “Popeyes,” a play on the pejorative name for Park: “the chicken. ” The podcast is usually downloaded 10 million times a week, but it has spiked to 14 million recently. The political and business class still believes in the system built by Park’s father, where corruption was tolerated for the sake of economic growth, but the people want something different, he said. “The collapse of the ruling class’s paradigm will bring about a positive change in South Korea,” Kim said. “South Koreans now have the chance to start afresh by truly living in the 21st century. A change of administration at the next election will be a start. The whole process might take a bit longer than people expect, but I believe it can happen because the fundamental and irreversible awakening of the public has already begun. ”     There may be an additional factor driving the public. “South Koreans identify themselves with national success, so it’s not hard to imagine their shame from this case,” said Oh   a researcher at Sogang University’s Institute of Social Sciences and author of popular political books about Korean youth. “Shame has been added to festering corruption, labor problems and economic issues, meaning that more people have come out on to the streets. ” There is reason to be optimistic, said Lee of Yonsei. “I think we’re the only country in the world that has gone through so much change in such a short period of time and succeeded,” he said, citing the progress made despite decades of authoritarian and military dictatorship. “We have a vibrant democracy, the economy is spluttering but is okay. We can adapt and deal with any kind of adversarial situation. “Creating something new out of chaos is something that Korean people are good at. ”  Yoonjung Seo contributed to this report.       "

Computer models are unanimous in predicting that such a cold wave will occur, although they differ some on exactly how cold and how far south and east the Arctic air will penetrate. It is unlikely that this cold wave will be as intense as the January 2014 event because it is happening earlier in the winter and less snow is on the ground in North America (snow cover acts like a freezer and helps cold air masses stay cold when they exit the Arctic). The bitter cold air is expected to first arrive in the northern Rockies and northern Plains on Sunday. It should reach Chicago on Tuesday and the northeast United States by Wednesday or Thursday.

","       Donald Trump is expected to name   executive Andrew Puzder, a vocal critic of substantially increasing the minimum wage and an opponent of rules that would make more workers eligible for overtime pay, as head of the Labor Department, according to a Republican briefed on the decision.  Puzder, who runs CKE Restaurants, the parent company of Hardee’s and Carl’s Jr. has been a harsh critic of raising the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour, arguing that it would increase costs for consumers and lead to fewer jobs. He also opposes the   Labor Department rule that aimed to make millions more workers eligible for overtime pay. As the head of a   company, Puzder is a supporter of the approach touted by Trump on the campaign trail that lowering taxes for corporations and the wealthy and loosening regulations for businesses can boost job creation. He is a strong opponent of the Affordable Care Act, which he claims has hurt the restaurant industry because higher health premiums have left consumers with less money to spend. By bringing in Puzder, Trump is signaling that he may scale back some of regulations introduced by current Labor Secretary Tom Perez. If confirmed, he will have the potential to reverse some of the Obama administration’s most notable efforts to bolster protections for workers, families and retirement savers.  His appointment could put the future of the Labor Department’s overtime rule into question. In a Forbes   that ran after the Labor Department finalized the overtime rule in May, Puzder wrote that the rule would “add to the extensive regulatory maze the Obama Administration has imposed on employers,” and that the rule would lead to fewer hours and reduced opportunities for workers. As Labor Secretary, Puzder could potentially decide not to defend the rule in court. He could also propose revisions to the rule, but any adjustments would likely require notice and public comment. With the upcoming nomination of the   executive, Trump would bring another top fundraiser into his cabinet. Puzder supported Trump’s race to the White House financially and served as an economic adviser to his campaign. He and his wife, Deanna, contributed a total of $332, 000 to helping Trump get elected, including money given to Trump’s campaign, to joint fundraising committees and to the Republican National Committee, according to the Federal Election Commission. His   stance is also viewed as a threat to another major rule finalized by the Labor Department earlier this year that would affect the investing advice given to retirement savers. The rule would require brokers and insurers to put their clients’ interest ahead of their own. Financial firms opposed to the rule say it is “burdensome” and could limit their ability to work with   investors. While Puzder has not addressed the regulation specifically, his nomination increases the likelihood that implementation of that rule could be delayed, according to an analyst report from the investment bank FBR & Co. The move could give lawmakers and the Trump administration more time to repeal or revise the rule. Puzder has said that government policies that increase labor costs, such as significantly raising the minimum wage, hurt small businesses and “encourage automation. ” In March, he told Business Insider that he and other   companies are investing in automation and considering machines that could tackle simple tasks such as taking customers’ orders. “If you’re making labor more expensive, and automation less expensive  —   this is not rocket science,” he said at the time, though he later added that he would never remove all   employees. Some business groups applauded Puzder’s likely nomination Thursday saying that the   executive understands the challenges faced by retailers and restaurants. “Andrew Puzder is someone with the   experience to understand workforce issues and how jobs are created,” said David French, senior vice president for government relations for the National Retail Federation, which also opposes the overtime rule. But some Democrats and consumer advocates are critical of Trump’s expected pick, saying his approach may harm   workers. “The Labor Secretary should be someone who wakes up every day thinking about how they can raise American wages and fight for American workers,” Sen. Charles Schumer said in a statement. “Mr. Puzder’s career has shown exactly the opposite. ” Puzder became the CEO of CKE Restaurants in 2000. The company, which has more than 3, 700 restaurant locations in 44 states and 39 countries, is in the process of relocating its headquarters from southern California to Nashville. Prior to joining the   business, he worked as a commercial trial lawyer in St. Louis, Mo. Philip Rucker contributed to this report.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 8, 2016   Jones, a union leader in Indianapolis, represents the Carrier workers whose jobs Donald Trump has pledged to save. He said the sudden attention from the country’s next leader didn’t feel real. “My first thought was, ‘Well, that’s not very nice,’ ” he told The Washington Post on Wednesday night. “Then, ’Well, I might not sleep much tonight.’ ” Jones, president of the United Steelworkers Local 1999, told The Post on Tuesday that he believed Trump had lied to the Carrier workers last week when he visited the Indianapolis plant. On a makeshift stage in a conference room, Trump had applauded United Technologies, Carrier’s parent company, for cutting a deal with him and agreeing to keep 1, 100 jobs that were slated to move to Mexico in America’s heartland. Jones said Trump got that figure wrong.       The Post’s Fact Checker took a closer look at the claims   Donald Trump made during a speech in Indiana on Dec. 1, about the deal to keep jobs at a Carrier plant there that were due to be shipped to Mexico. (Jenny   Washington Post)   Carrier, he said, had agreed to preserve 800 production jobs in Indiana. (Carrier confirmed that number.) The union leader said Trump appeared to be taking credit for rescuing 350 engineering positions that were never scheduled to leave. Five hundred fifty of his members, he said, were still losing their jobs. And the company was still collecting millions of dollars in tax breaks. In return for downsizing its move south of the border, United Technologies would receive $7 million in tax credits from Indiana, to be paid in $700, 000 installments each year for 10 years. Carrier, on top of that, has agreed to invest $16 million in its Indiana operation. United Technologies, meanwhile, still plans to shuttle 700 factory jobs from Huntington, Ind. to Monterrey, Mexico. Jones, who said the union wasn’t involved in the negotiations, said he’s working to lift his members’ spirits. He said he didn’t have time to worry about Trump. “He needs to worry about getting his Cabinet filled,” he said, “and leave me the hell alone. ”  Representatives for Trump did not respond to The Post’s requests for comment. Over the past two decades, the United States has lost about 4. 5 million manufacturing jobs, a consequence economists ascribe to trade and automation. Jones said he has fought to keep work on U. S. soil, bargaining repeatedly with Carrier and Rexnord, another Indianapolis plant that plans to relocate jobs to Mexico.

He wasn’t sure how these people found his number.  “Nothing that says they’re gonna kill me, but, you know, you better keep your eye on your kids,” Jones said later on MSNBC. “We know what car you drive. Things along those lines. ” “I’ve been doing this job for 30 years, and I’ve heard everything from people who want to burn my house down or shoot me,” he added. “So I take it with a grain of salt and I don’t put a lot of faith in that, and I’m not concerned about it and I’m not getting anybody involved. I can deal with people that make stupid statements and move on. ” Brett Voorhies, president of the Indiana State   called Jones after Trump’s tweet caught his eye. Jones, he said, had just left his office in Indianapolis, where he manages the needs of about 3, 000 union members. “This guy makes pennies for what he does,” Voorhies said. “What he has to put up with is just crazy.

","    During the presidential campaign, House Speaker Paul D. Ryan ( .) was one of the most passionate and eloquent defenders of House Republicans’ multipronged investigations of Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton’s actions as secretary of state. When some accused Republicans of clamoring for investigations of Clinton’s emails and family foundation just to undermine her campaign, Ryan reframed the inquiries as a matter of principle: “I think it goes without saying we should treat people fairly. No one should be above the rules, no one should be above the law, and that’s what we’re looking for, equality,” Ryan told CNN’s Jake Tapper in a July interview. “So that people should be held to the same set of standards. That’s the problem with Washington, is people think there’s   and they think that everybody is being held to different standards. And the problem is that that’s true!”    Now that Donald Trump won, those words could come back to haunt Ryan. With each passing day, Trump is tangling himself in a knot of potential business and family conflicts of interest while he runs the country. That means Republicans in Congress could soon find the tables turned: Democrats clamoring for ethics investigations of the president. And what’s more, they’d be able to point to Ryan’s own argument  —   that no one should be above the law  —   to make their case.         It probably won’t surprise you to hear that Ryan is not nearly as bullish on investigating Trump as he was Clinton. He has been repeatedly asked over the past week or two how he feels about Trump’s potential for conflicts of interest, and his answer has boiled down to: It’s not my problem. “How do you want him to address his business conflicts?” CNBC’s Andrew Ross Sorkin asked Ryan in an interview Wednesday. Ryan responded: “However he wants to. You know, this is not what I’m concerned about in Congress. ” When pressed on it again, Ryan said: “I have every bit of confidence he’s going to get himself right with moving from being the business guy that he is to the president he’s going to become. I’m focused on getting this agenda passed so that we can turn around and tackle this country’s big problems before they tackle us. That is what I’m focused on. And not the legal details of how he divorces himself from his business, which I know he will. ” In other words: As long as Trump is signing my tax reform and Obamacare repeal bills into law, and there’s no legally verified conflicts of interest, no problem.  To some degree, that’s politics: You hit the opposition when you can, and you duck when they’re hitting you, even if it’s for arguably the same thing. The problem for Ryan is that Trump is giving no indication that he plans to divorce himself from his business at all, at least not in a way that most government ethics experts think is sufficient to prevent a situation in which Trump could make a decision based on his checkbook. And that means accusations of Trump’s conflicts of interest probably won’t be going away. Presidents have had conflicts of interest before, of course. But most of them have put their assets in a blind trust (i. e. NOT in the hands of their family members) to avoid it. As to how this compares with Clinton, those same government watchdog experts questioning Trump’s family business setup were also asking questions about how Clinton as president would separate herself from her family’s Clinton Foundation. But the Clinton Foundation is a nonprofit. Trump’s business is very much for profit, and it very much affects his personal wealth. And that underscores the dilemma Trump could be backing himself (and Hill Republicans) into: We’ve never before had a president with so many financial interests in so many countries. On top of that, we’ll soon have a president who wants to have his family run those interests while simultaneously appearing to advise him on his presidency. Already, Trump’s phone call with Taiwan’s president was dissected not just for its geopolitical dominoes, but for its effect on his bottom line: Trump apparently considered hotel investments in Taiwan earlier this year. And Ivanka Trump’s decision to hold a meeting on climate change with Al Gore (a meeting Trump participated in) raised eyebrows, given that she’s supposed to be handling her father’s financial interests as well. Ryan is allowed to have different opinions on different politicians’ potential conflicts of interest; that’s politics. But brushing off Trump’s may not be an option for Ryan for much longer, especially given the moral high ground he took when the tables were turned."
142131,217509,Senate Democrats threaten brief shutdown over policies they hope Trump will support,Washington Post,Kelsey Snell,2016-12-08,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161208231150/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2016/12/08/senate-democrats-threaten-brief-government-shutdown/
","     Senate Democrats are threatening to force a brief government shutdown this weekend to pressure Republicans to support policies they say match promises   Donald Trump made on the campaign trail to help coal country and boost American manufacturers. Government funding is set to run out at the end of Friday and lawmakers are currently considering a stopgap spending bill that would keep federal agencies funded through April 28. The angry Democrats are not threatening to block the spending measure, but to threaten to miss the Friday deadline in hopes they can entice Republicans into further negotiations. The tension over the spending bill is a sign of the possible scrambled alliances to come when Trump is inaugurated and how they could prove to be a headache for Republican leaders. The senator fighting to have more generous medical and pension benefits for retired coal miners included in the spending bill is West Virginia Democrat Joe Manchin III, whose state Trump won handily, in part, by promising to renew the coal industry. Manchin is one of several red state Democrats expected to face a tough reelection bid in 2018. He is set to meet with the   at Trump Tower on Friday morning and it’s unclear whether they’ll discuss the issue. The Democratic senator has been floated as a possible member of Trump’s cabinet. “I want to shut her down,” Manchin said Wednesday about the government, pointing to his anger over concerns about the miner provisions. “I mean this is ridiculous . . . You can’t throw 16, 000 people out. ” About 12, 500 former union miners and their families have been told their health benefits will lapse come Jan. 1, and an additional 10, 000 are in danger of losing benefits at a later date. Many are also facing potential cuts to their retirement benefits due to declining coal companies being unable to make required contributions to pension funds. Manchin is demanding a vote on an amendment to extend miners’ medical benefits for one year. Democrats are playing up the  ’s support for coal country as they try to pressure Republicans. Sen. Heidi Heitkamp ( . D.) called out Trump by name as she left a Thursday meeting between Senate Minority Leader Harry M. Reid ( .) and several of the Democrats who represents states where Trump won. “We think there has been a renewed interest in these kind of issues with   Donald Trump,” said Heitkamp who recently met with him in New York. “We’re hopeful that we’ll be able to get relief and be able to deliver a Christmas present to some of the most sympathetic working people in America. ” Senate Democrats also want funding for the “Buy American” program included in a water resources bill that is slated to come up for a Senate vote after the spending bill is complete. Republicans have been willing to support the provision as part of temporary spending bills but resisted including it in more permanent legislation like the water bill. That tension puts Republicans at odds with Trump, who backed the concept at a rally last week. “Whether it’s producing steel, building cars or curing disease, we want the next generation of innovation and production to happen right here in America and right here in Ohio, right?” Trump said in Cincinnati. One Republican, Sen. Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia, said Thursday she will oppose the stopgap unless the miners provision is addressed. Six other GOP senators signed a letter last month supporting a long term fix to the health care issue. House Republicans have shown little interest in negotiating on the issue. AshLee Strong, a spokeswoman for House Speaker Paul D. Ryan ( .) said the House is set to leave Washington after voting Thursday afternoon and does not plan to consider any further legislation until January The House on Thursday passed the spending bill on a 326 to 96 vote. The Senate will now need to vote on the legislation by the end of Friday to avert a government shutdown. But there would need to be unanimous consent to take up the bill in time to meet that deadline and Democrats are threatening to withhold their support for such a procedural move. The Senate would still be able to vote Sunday to pass the appropriations measure without this consent, but it would force a roughly   government shutdown. The effort by Democrats to stick together to force action for miners and steelworkers has also sparked intraparty tensions  —   specifically, because the spending bill and an accompanying water projects package include funding to address the water crisis in Flint, Mich.  —   which has been a priority for Democratic lawmakers for more than a year. “Here’s the thing: It feels like there’s always a reason not to do Flint,” said Rep. Daniel Kildee ( .) who urged his Senate colleagues to pass both bills. “People who live in Flint and places like Flint get kind of accustomed to being left behind. They get kind of accustomed to having other priorities supersede theirs. And you know what? Enough of that . . . Their interests have to sometimes come before other important priorities. ”"

"," John Glenn, who captured the nation’s attention in 1962 as the first American to orbit the Earth during a tense time when the United States sought supremacy over the Soviet Union in the space race, and who rocketed back into space 36 years later, becoming the oldest astronaut in history, died Dec. 8 at a hospital in Columbus, Ohio. Mr. Glenn, who in his   career served four terms as a U. S. senator from Ohio, was 95.  The death was confirmed by Hank Wilson, communications director at the John Glenn College of Public Affairs at Ohio State University. Mr. Glenn had a stroke after   replacement surgery in 2014, but the immediate cause was not announced.  Mr. Glenn was one of the seven original astronauts in NASA’s Mercury program, which was a conspicuous symbol of the country’s military and technological might at the height of the Cold War. He was not the first American in space  —   two of his fellow astronauts preceded him  —   but his   circumnavigation of the globe captured the imagination of his countrymen like few events before or since. Mr. Glenn was the last survivor of the Mercury Seven. “John always had the right stuff,” President Obama said in a statement, adding that Mr. Glenn “reminded us that with courage and a spirit of discovery there’s no limit to the heights we can reach together. ”  In an era when fear of encroaching Soviet influence reached from the White House to kindergarten classrooms, Mr. Glenn, in his silver astronaut suit, lifted the hopes of a nation on his shining shoulders. When he emerged smiling from his Friendship 7 capsule after returning from space, cheers echoed throughout the land.        “You had to have been alive at that time to comprehend the reaction of the nation, practically all of it,” author Tom Wolfe, who coined the phrase “the right stuff” to describe Mr. Glenn and the other Mercury astronauts, wrote in a 2009 essay. “John Glenn, in 1962, was the last true national hero America has ever had. ”  After he was elected to the U. S. Senate from Ohio in 1974, Mr. Glenn served on Capitol Hill for 24 years and made a halfhearted run for the Democratic presidential nomination in 1984. When he was 77 and completing his fourth Senate term in 1998, he had one final flight of glory, returning to space as a crew member aboard the space shuttle Discovery.  As heroes go, the   Mr. Glenn appeared unassuming and seemed to embody the   values of modesty, steadiness and hard work. He had climbed the ranks of the Marine Corps, becoming a full colonel, by accepting the most dangerous assignments and never flinching under pressure. He flew 149 combat missions in two wars and was a test pilot in the 1950s, when    airplanes often veered out of control and crashed in smoking heaps. When he joined the astronaut corps in 1959, no one knew whether a human being could survive the ordeals of space travel. Yet for all the risks he faced, Mr. Glenn was a man of careful preparation and quiet responsibility.   John Glenn in 1998 next to a portrait of himself from his earlier days. (Robert  )  ‘Godspeed, John Glenn’ On Oct. 4, 1957, the Soviet Union made a bold advance on the Cold War chessboard by launching Sputnik, the first   satellite to orbit Earth. In response, the U. S. government formed NASA in 1958 amid widespread fear that the country was falling behind the Soviets in technology and military strength. Of the seven original astronauts of the Mercury program  —   the others were M. Scott Carpenter, L. Gordon Cooper Jr. Virgil I. “Gus” Grissom, Walter M. “Wally” Schirra Jr. Alan B. Shepard Jr. and Donald K. “Deke” Slayton  —   Mr. Glenn was the oldest and the lone Marine. A lieutenant colonel at the time, he also had the highest rank and the most combat experience. He did not drink, smoke or swear and maintained a disciplined,   manner while training in Cocoa Beach, Fla. near NASA’s space center at Cape Canaveral. Comfortable in front of cameras  —   which followed the astronauts everywhere after they signed a $500, 000 deal with Life magazine for a series of exclusive stories  —   Mr. Glenn was in many ways the public face of NASA. Privately, however, there was friction among the “Magnificent Seven,” as the Mercury astronauts were dubbed in the news media. Concerned that some of his colleagues’ dalliances with women could lead to bad publicity and jeopardize the manned space program, Mr. Glenn confronted his fellow astronauts, admonishing them to avoid any semblance of wrongdoing. “There was no doubt whatsoever that Glenn meant every word of it,” Wolfe wrote in his 1979 book, “The Right Stuff. ” “When he got his back up, he was formidable. He was not to be trifled with. ” Not all of the astronauts were pleased with Mr. Glenn’s righteousness, however, and Shepard told him to mind his own business. “His moralizing led to colorful and heated exchanges among the pilots, and it wasn’t pleasant banter,” Shepard and Slayton wrote in their 1995 book, “Moon Shot. ” When the astronauts voted among themselves to confer the honor of being the first American in space, they chose Shepard. On May 5, 1961, Shepard had a   suborbital space flight, followed two months later by Grissom on a similar mission. But two Soviet cosmonauts had already circled the Earth by August 1961. Mr. Glenn’s turn came on Feb. 20, 1962. After 11 delays because of bad weather or faulty equipment, he sat in his tiny space capsule, the Friendship 7, atop an   rocket that had failed in 40 percent of its test flights. After liftoff at 9:47 a. m. backup pilot Carpenter said on national television, “Godspeed, John Glenn. ” The moment was shared by practically the entire nation, as a television audience of 135 million  —   the largest up to that time  —   witnessed the launch. The flight plan called for seven orbits, but after the first, the capsule began to wobble. Mr. Glenn overrode the automatic navigation system and piloted Friendship 7 with manual controls for two more orbits, reaching a height of 162 miles above the Earth’s surface. Midway through the flight, a warning light indicated that the heat shield, which would protect the capsule during its reentry into Earth’s atmosphere, may have come loose. Without a heat shield, it was possible that Mr. Glenn could burn up inside the capsule as it raced back from space. As Friendship 7 was descending, all radio contact was lost. Shepard, acting as “capsule communicator” from Cape Canaveral, tried to reach Mr. Glenn in his spacecraft, saying, “How do you read? Over. ” After about 4 minutes and 20 seconds of silence, Mr. Glenn could finally be heard: “Loud and clear. How me?” “How are you doing?” Shepard asked. “Oh, pretty good,” Mr. Glenn casually responded, later adding, “but that was a real fireball, boy. ” Exterior pieces of the capsule’s had broken off during reentry and burst into flame. A defective warning light caused much of the panic, but during those four tense minutes, it was feared that Mr. Glenn had been lost  —   along with the promise of the space program. When he splashed down in the Atlantic Ocean after 4 hours 56 minutes aloft, Mr. Glenn emerged as an almost mythic figure who had scaled heights no American had reached before. “I was fully aware of the danger,” he said in 1968. “No matter what preparation you make, there comes the moment of truth. You’re playing with big stakes  —   your life. But the important thing to me wasn’t fear but what you can do to control it. ” He was greeted upon his return by President John F. Kennedy and Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson. After an estimated 1 million spectators crowded the streets of Washington, Mr. Glenn insisted that the other six Mercury astronauts join him for a parade before 4 million people in New York. “During his   parade up Broadway,” Wolfe wrote, “you have never heard such cheers or seen so many thousands of people crying. ” From pilot to politics John Herschel Glenn Jr. was born July 18, 1921, in Cambridge, Ohio, and grew up in New Concord, Ohio. His father ran a plumbing supply business and later had a Chevrolet dealership. His mother taught at an elementary school. Mr. Glenn was an honor student in high school, lettered in three sports and played trumpet in the band. At Muskingum College in New Concord, he was a reserve center on the football team. He took flying lessons in his teens and left college early in 1942 to enter a Navy pilot training program before transferring to the aviation branch of the Marine Corps. On April 6, 1943, he married Anna “Annie” Castor, whom he had known since childhood. During World War II, Mr. Glenn flew 59 missions as a fighter pilot and took part in the Marshall Islands campaign in the Pacific. He was stationed on Guam in the Western Pacific and was a flight instructor in Texas before returning to action in the Korean War. He was in the same squadron in Korea as baseball star Ted Williams and flew 90 missions as a jet fighter pilot. He once returned with more than 200 holes shot through the fuselage and wings of his plane. Attached to an Air Force unit, Mr. Glenn shot down three   MiGs during the final nine days of the war in 1953, leading his crew to paint “MiG Mad Marine” on the side of his   Sabre jet. After Korea, Mr. Glenn was a test pilot at the naval air station at Patuxent River, Md. and set a transcontinental speed record on July 16, 1957, by flying an   Crusader jet coast to coast in 3 hours 23 minutes. He worked at the Navy’s Bureau of Aeronautics and eventually was awarded a bachelor’s degree by Muskingum. He also found time in 1957 to appear on the game show “Name That Tune” with child actor Eddie Hodges. They split $25, 000 in prize money, which was more than Mr. Glenn’s annual pay as a test pilot. When NASA began recruiting a team of astronauts, it sought skilled pilots who could withstand rigorous physical and psychological testing and who  —   to fit into cramped space capsules  —   were shorter than 5 feet 11 inches tall. (Mr. Glenn was    1   2.) With their courage and   the Mercury astronauts embodied the spirit of the “New Frontier” espoused by Kennedy, and Mr. Glenn became friends with the youthful president and his brother Robert F. Kennedy, the attorney general. Encouraged by the Kennedy family, Mr. Glenn resigned from the astronaut corps in 1964 to run for the U. S. Senate in Ohio. He dropped out after slipping on a rug and striking his head on a bathtub, resulting in   problems that required extensive medical treatment. In 1965, he retired from the Marine Corps, having received six Distinguished Flying Crosses and 19 Air Medals. He then became an executive with Royal Crown Cola, invested in real estate and worked with a management company that operated Holiday Inns, particularly around Orlando. Within a few years, he was a millionaire. Mr. Glenn stayed close to the Kennedys and was at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles when Robert Kennedy was assassinated in June 1968. He accompanied five of Kennedy’s 10 children (an 11th was born after his death) back to their home in McLean, Va. The next morning, Mr. Glenn informed the other children that their father had been killed. “When Bob died, I had to sit on the edge of the bed as each child was waking up and tell them their dad was not coming home,” Mr. Glenn told a Muskingum audience in 1997. “It was one of the hardest things I ever did. ” He was a pallbearer at Robert Kennedy’s funeral at Arlington National Cemetery and handed the flag from the coffin to Sen. Edward M. Kennedy ( . ). Soon afterward, Mr. Glenn helped organize a group that successfully lobbied for passage of a national gun control act in 1968. ‘I have held a job, Howard’ Making a second bid for the Senate in 1970, Mr. Glenn called for the withdrawal of U. S. troops from Vietnam, but he lost the Democratic primary in Ohio to businessman Howard M. Metzenbaum.  . Robert Taft Jr. a Republican, won the general election. Early in 1974, Metzenbaum was appointed to the Senate to fill the expiring term of William B. Saxbe, who resigned to become U. S. attorney general. When Metzenbaum ran for a full Senate term that year, Mr. Glenn challenged him again in the primary. At a time when the military was unpopular, Metzenbaum repeatedly called Mr. Glenn “colonel” and questioned his ability as a leader, saying he had never “met a payroll. ” The comment was widely seen as an insult, insinuating that Mr. Glenn had never held a “real” job. In a debate with Metzenbaum, the retired Marine flashed the steel beneath his benign Midwestern smile. “I served 23 years in the United States Marine Corps,” Mr. Glenn said. “I was through two wars. I flew 149 missions. My plane was hit by antiaircraft fire on 12 different occasions. “I was in the space program. It wasn’t my checkbook, it was my life that was on the line. . . . I ask you to go with me . . . to a veterans hospital, and look those men with their mangled bodies in the eye and tell them they didn’t hold a job. “You go with me to any Gold Star mother, and you look her in the eye and tell her that her son did not hold a job. “. . . Stand in Arlington National Cemetery  —   where I have more friends than I like to remember  —   and you watch those waving flags . . . and you tell me that those people didn’t have a job. “I tell you, Howard Metzenbaum, you should be on your knees every day of your life thanking God that there were some men  —   some men  —   who held a job. . . . And their   is what has made this country possible. “I have held a job, Howard. ” The powerful “Gold Star Mother” speech, recognizing families that had lost children in foreign wars, quickly turned the polls in Mr. Glenn’s favor. He defeated Metzenbaum in the primary and then easily won the November general election, sweeping all of Ohio’s 88 counties. Reelected in 1980, 1986 and 1992, Mr. Glenn was the first senator from Ohio to win four consecutive elections. A senator in space On Capitol Hill, Mr. Glenn was a strong supporter of the military and an authority on intelligence issues. He supported a woman’s right to abortion and was an advocate of campaign finance reform, national health insurance and medical research. He sponsored bills to improve the safety of nursing homes, reduce government paperwork and limit nuclear proliferation. As chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee from 1988 to 1994, he helped create the Department of Veterans Affairs. In the late 1980s, Mr. Glenn’s political action committee accepted a contribution from financier Charles H. Keating Jr. who was at the center of a nationwide    scandal. The Senate Ethics Committee ruled that Mr. Glenn “exercised poor judgment,” but he was cleared of any wrongdoing. He made a run for the 1984 Democratic presidential nomination but proved to be an awkward campaigner and quit the race early, saying, “I humiliated my family, gained 16 pounds and went millions of dollars into debt. ” On Feb. 20, 1997, the 35th anniversary of his spaceflight, Mr. Glenn announced that he would not run for reelection in 1998. He established a public policy institute at Ohio State University and wrote his memoirs. In 2012, Mr. Glenn was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation’s highest civilian honor. In addition to his wife, of Columbus and Bethesda, Md. survivors include two children, J. David Glenn of Berkeley, Calif. and Carolyn “Lyn” Glenn of St. Paul, Minn.; and two grandsons.  Revered for his heroism as an astronaut, Mr. Glenn remained close to the space program long after leaving NASA. In 1986, immediately after the explosion of the space shuttle Challenger, he made a   trip to Cape Canaveral to comfort the families of astronauts killed in the disaster. Every year, he sent the results of his physical exams to NASA, just in case. At 75, he could still do 75  . In 1996, he set a flying record by piloting a   plane from Dayton, Ohio, to Washington in 1 hour, 36 minutes. When Mr. Glenn was named to the crew of the space shuttle Discovery, skeptics said NASA was awarding him a vanity flight to make him, at 77, the oldest person ever to go into space. During the   mission in 1998, Mr. Glenn helped film the flight and took part in experiments on aging. He made one of his final public appearances in June 2016, when the Columbus airport was renamed in his honor. His return to space was a reminder of what he had accomplished more than three decades earlier, when he soared into the heavens and gave renewed hope to a grateful nation. “People are afraid of the future, of the unknown,” he said in 1962. “If a man faces up to it and takes the dare of the future, he can have some control over his destiny. ”  Read more  Washington Post obituaries    Neil Armstrong, first man to step on the moon, dies at 82   Bob Hoover, pilot who escaped POW camp by stealing a German plane, dies at 94   Edgar D.

142133,217511,"The coming Trump kleptocracy, perfectly captured in a single sentence",Washington Post,Greg Sargent,2016-12-08,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161208231150/https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2016/12/08/the-coming-trump-kleptocracy-perfectly-captured-in-a-single-sentence/
","         THE MORNING PLUM: If you want to understand why the    involving Donald Trump’s business holdings and presidency could matter enormously in the months and years to come, read this single sentence buried in today’s big Wall Street Journal piece about those holdings: It’s not clear how much Mr. Trump’s businesses would benefit from his proposal to cut business tax rates. The key part of that sentence is the phrase, “it’s not clear. ” The Journal piece reports that Trump has employed a “web” of limited liability companies to house assets accounting for over $300 million of the revenues he reported in disclosure forms last year. The crucial revelation in the piece is that these entities are a key reason why many of the specific details of Trump’s holdings remain shrouded in “opacity. ” Meanwhile, the New York Times reports this morning: “Trump is considering formally turning over the operational responsibility for his real estate company to his two adult sons, but he intends to keep a stake in the business and resist calls to divest, according to several people briefed on the discussions. ” As I’ve reported, if Trump merely turns his businesses over to family members (never mind whether he keeps a stake) it will not remove the potential for conflicts or even corruption. His family could stand to benefit from his policy decisions, or alternatively, other entities could seek to curry favor with the new president through deals that benefit his businesses, and by extension, his family (or himself, if he keeps a stake). Ethics experts believe only putting his interests into a genuine blind trust, via the liquidation of his assets, would truly remove the possibility of conflicts. But, now that this looks unlikely to happen, what needs to be emphasized is not simply that such conflicts are very real possibilities, though that’s important. It also matters greatly that our lack of knowledge of the full range and scope of his interests makes it hard to evaluate whether these conflicts are taking place in any given situation, and if so, what they truly mean. And that’s where the new Journal story comes in. Here is the rub of the matter: None of the 96 LLCs examined by the Journal appear to regularly release audited financial statements. That opacity  —   compounded by Mr. Trump’s decision to break with decades of precedent by declining to release his tax returns  —   makes it impossible to gauge the full extent of potential conflicts between his business interests and presidential role. The scope and complexity of Mr. Trump’s private business holdings is unprecedented for incoming presidents, said Norman Eisen, President Barack Obama’s former White House ethics lawyer. “We’ve never seen anything like this,” he said. It’s not clear how much Mr. Trump’s businesses would benefit from his proposal to cut business tax rates.  …     Mr. Trump’s wealth is impossible to measure with precision. His financial disclosure form isn’t externally audited and  —   following government rules  —   often uses bands, such as more than $50 million, rather than exact amounts to report assets and revenue or income. Only a handful of the hundreds of entities listed in Mr. Trump’s financial disclosure publish audited financial statements  —   and those figures don’t necessarily illuminate Mr. Trump’s financial situation. Trump has called for huge tax cuts, including for top earners and businesses, and Congressional Republicans are all but certain to go forward with the same. But, as the Journal points out, we cannot know what impact these policies will have on Trump’s own businesses  —   or his family’s. Noah Bookbinder, the executive director for Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, tells me that this captures a key aspect of the broader problem here. Bookbinder says: “We still have not seen his tax returns or a comprehensive account of his business interests. So we don’t fully know what effect his policy proposals  —   including his tax policy proposals  —   will have on his financial interests or his family’s bottom line. The fact that the Trump family would profit at all is a huge problem. But we can’t know the scope of those profits unless we get a full accounting of what these interests are. “In evaluating the policies that a president is pushing, it’s important for the public to understand what his motivations are  —   whether his motivations are   or the public interest. Until we know what the effect will be on his own bottom line  —   or his family’s  —   we can’t really determine that. ” And this underscores again that Congressional Republicans could be taking specific steps to try to compel Trump to show more transparency about the full scope and range of his interests  —   if they wanted to. If Trump does fail to do anything more than transfer his businesses to his family  —   or, worse, does so while retaining an interest himself  —   the likely abdication of Congressional Republicans in trying to compel more transparency should be seen as a big part of this story. ************************************************ * TRUMP’S PREFERENCE FOR GENERALS STIRS CONCERNS: The Post reports that Trump has now picked three generals for top slots in his administration, raising worries among critics, such as this one from Dem Senator Chris Murphy: “Each of these individuals may have great merit in their own right, but what we’ve learned over the past 15 years is that when we view problems in the world through a military lens, we make big mistakes. ” During the campaign, Trump repeatedly cast disdain on generals, claiming to understand military matters better than they, but maybe that’s all out the window now. * TRUMP WILL PROBABLY DISMANTLE THE EPA: Trump has picked climate change denier and fossil fuel ally Scott Pruitt to head the EPA, and the New York Times reports that environmental advocates believe this means it will soon be reduced to smoking, toxic wreckage. As one puts it:  “During the campaign, Mr. Trump regularly threatened to dismantle the E. P. A. and roll back many of the gains made to reduce Americans’ exposures to industrial pollution, and with Pruitt, the   would make good on those threats. It’s a safe assumption that Pruitt could be the most hostile E. P. A. administrator toward clean air and safe drinking water in history. ”  And, of course, Pruitt will do a great deal to weaken Obama’s executive actions designed to reduce carbon emissions. Remember when Trump claimed to have an “open mind” about climate change? * TRUMP’S PICKS BREAK WITH AGENCY MISSIONS: This is a fascinating point from the Post   of Trump’s choice of Pruitt:  He is the third of Trump’s nominees who have key philosophical differences with the missions of the agencies they have been tapped to run. Ben Carson, named to head the Department of Housing and Urban Development, has expressed a deep aversion to the social safety net programs and fair housing initiatives that have been central to that agency’s activities. Betsy DeVos, named education secretary, has a passion for private school vouchers that critics say undercut the public school systems at the core of the government’s mission.  As this blog has tried to warn you, we’re now looking at the possibility of radical, disruptive change that could impact millions. * LIBERALS PLAN BIG CAMPAIGN TO SAVE OBAMACARE: Politico reports that outside groups are gearing up to defend the law from repeal. This is part of the game plan: The campaign will detail how many people in each state would lose coverage if the law is repealed, as well as the negative impact on hospitals and other health care organizations  …    . The groups also hope to put pressure on Republicans to simultaneously offer an effective proposal to replace Obamacare to ensure that the 20 million people who’ve gained coverage under the law don’t lose their benefits, if the repeal efforts move forward. Remember, there are huge numbers of such people in states with GOP senators and Members of Congress. The question is whether they’ll be moved by the specter of many of their own constituents losing health care. Don’t bet on it. * AMERICANS SEE ROLE GOVERNMENT ROLE IN HEALTH CARE: With Obamacare repeal high on the agenda, a new Gallup poll finds that a majority of Americans  —   52 percent  —   say government has a “responsibility” to “make sure all Americans have health care coverage,” while 45 percent say it doesn’t. Of course, 72 percent of Republicans say government doesn’t have any such role, so majority views on this are unlikely to matter in the least. * AND THE TRUMP TWEET OF THE DAY,     EDITION: Chuck Jones, the head of the union that represents the Carrier workers, criticized Trump because more than half of the jobs Trump “saved” are still going to Mexico. To which Trump replied:   If United Steelworkers 1999 was any good, they would have kept those jobs in Indiana. Spend more time   time talking. Reduce dues  —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 8, 2016   It’s good to see that Trump has identified the lack of worker power as a key part of the problem workers face!  "
142134,217512,What Kellyanne Conway gets right (and wrong) about moms and work,Washington Post,Ruth Marcus,2016-12-08,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161208231150/https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/what-kellyanne-conway-gets-right-and-wrong-about-moms-and-work/2016/12/08/f8d7faf8-bd90-11e6-91ee-1adddfe36cbe_story.html
"," As if she didn’t have enough on her hands with the   Donald Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway has plunged   into a topic at least as emotionally charged: the Mommy Wars. Speaking at a Politico “Women Rule” event Wednesday, Conway cited her four young children as the reason for declining a White House job.  “My children are 12, 12, 8 and 7, which is bad idea, bad idea, bad idea, bad idea for Mom going inside,” she said. “They have to come first, and those are very fraught ages. ”  When the possibility of an administration role came up in her talks with senior officials, Conway said, they would say, “ ‘I know you have four kids but . . .’ I said, ‘There’s nothing that comes after the “but” that makes any sense to me, so don’t even try.’ Like what is the ‘but’? But they’ll eat Cheerios for the rest of the day? Nobody will brush their teeth again until I get home?”  The question for “the male sitting across from me who’s going to take a big job in the White House,” Conway said, “isn’t: ‘Would you take the job?’ . . . The question is: ‘Would you want your wife to? Would you want the mother of your children to?’ ”     Four women share their experiences working in the White House: the grueling hours, dealing with a ’boys’ club’ mentality and, crucially, getting access to the president. (Deirdra O’  Washington Post)   Okay, this is the wrong question but not necessarily the wrong answer. It’s the wrong question because the test shouldn’t be whether the men would want their wives to take on the burden of a White House role. It’s whether their wives would want to. It’s not necessarily the wrong answer because, as much as we should insist that the decision about how to juggle work and family should not be dictated by gender, it would be unrealistic to think that gender does not play a role in many women’s choices. Is that a matter of biology and inherent difference between the sexes? Is it a consequence of longtime societal arrangements and cultural expectations that are evolving, however slowly? I don’t know, and I’m not sure the answer matters to anybody’s  —   any mother’s  —   individual  .  It didn’t matter to mine. I have half the number of children as Conway and, when they were young, was confronting a job far less   than one in the White House  —   a workplace where, as former White House chief of staff Rahm Emanuel once said, “The only family we’re going to be good for is the first family. ”  Still, and completely contrary to   expectations, I found myself wanting to scale back after my daughters were born.  I did, with help from an accommodating employer. I took myself out of an editing role because I could not envision a   future on that track. I became an editorial writer, then a columnist, and worked every permutation of   work imaginable: three days a week, four short days so I could pick up the girls at school.  Now the nest is empty, and I am back full  . It was the right decision for me, and for my family. And if Conway were my friend, I would advise her to make the choice that feels right, but also that the cliches are true: The time with the kids goes so fast. You can’t get it back. The Mommy Wars rage so fiercely because the emotions they evoke hit so close to home. The    moms or   feel disrespected; the multitasking Superwomen feel even more judged, as Bad Mommies. Each side is inclined to feel slighted by the other.  Which is why Conway’s comments, especially in the raw aftermath of the Trump campaign, were destined to incite. Conway, Suzanne Monyak wrote for Slate, “seems to believe that it is the onus of the woman in a family to sacrifice her career opportunities so that her husband may have his. Even more troubling, Conway implies that no good mother should take on such a job  —   an attitude that feels ripped out of ‘Mad Men.’ ”  But you don’t have to be stuck in the ’60s to have some queasiness about taking such a demanding job, and Conway tried to insulate herself from just this accusation, noting, “Every woman should be respected for making her own choice. ” And Conway didn’t say that wives should scale back to accommodate husbands so much as she seemed to recognize the current reality that, when something’s got to give, it’s the mom who’s going to do the giving.  In a perfect world, sure, maybe, the division of family labor would be perfectly equal, every workplace maximally flexible. Meanwhile, as Conway said, “for me the lesson also is all the opportunities out there for women increasingly, in politics, in media, in public policy . . . that you still have to make choices, and there are limits. ” That this is a hard truth, and that Conway is the messenger does not make it any less accurate.

I’m tired of being lied to about our jobs.,Washington Post,Chuck Jones,2016-12-08,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161208231150/http://washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2016/12/08/im-the-union-leader-donald-trump-attacked-im-tired-of-being-lied-to-about-our-jobs/
","         I’m a union leader in Indianapolis. I represent the Carrier workers whose jobs Donald Trump has pledged to save. And I’m tired of being lied to. In February, corporate officials came to our plant and announced that they were closing the facility. They would move 1, 300 jobs to a plant in Mexico. (Three hundred and fifty positions would remain in Indianapolis, mostly filled by research and development staff.) Over the next several months, my team and I worked tirelessly to keep Carrier in our city. We came up with $23 million in savings, but the Carrier brass said that wasn’t enough. They could save $65 million by moving to Mexico. We couldn’t match that unless we were willing to cut wages to $  and cut all benefits. So we started to negotiate a severance package instead  —   one week of pay for every year of service, a $2, 500 lump sum for every employee and free health care for six months. Then, a couple of weeks ago, Trump got involved. He sat down with Carrier leaders. Afterward, he announced that 1, 100 jobs would be saved. When I first heard the news, I was optimistic. But I began to get nervous when we couldn’t get any details on the deal. I urged caution, but our members got their hopes up. They thought their jobs had been saved. When I met with Carrier officials last Thursday, I realized that that wouldn’t be the case. Though Trump said he’d saved 1, 100 jobs, he hadn’t. Carrier told us that 550 people would get laid off. Trump didn’t tell people that, though. When he spoke at our plant, he acted like no one was going to lose their job. People went crazy for him. They thought, because of Trump, I’m going to be able to provide for my family.  All the while, I’m sitting there, thinking that’s not what the damn numbers say. Trump let people believe that they were going to have a livelihood in that facility. He let people breathe easy. When I told our members the next day, they were devastated. I was angry, too. So I told a reporter the truth  —   that Trump’s 1, 100 number was wrong. When Trump read my comments, he got angry. Last night, he tweeted:   Chuck Jones, who is President of United Steelworkers 1999, has done a terrible job representing workers. No wonder companies flee country!  —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 8, 2016     If United Steelworkers 1999 was any good, they would have kept those jobs in Indiana. Spend more time   time talking. Reduce dues  —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 8, 2016   Now our office is getting phone calls and emails from people who are mad that I called Trump on his dishonesty. One man left five messages (though when I called him back and told him who I was, he hung up the phone). Some people have suggested that Trump didn’t mean to lie, he just got the numbers wrong. But I know that’s not true. On the campaign trail, Trump made perfectly clear how excellent a negotiator he is. I have negotiated hundreds of contracts. I know that if I’m going to have a fighting chance, I better damn well know the numbers. To be honest, the attention isn’t a big deal. I’ve been doing this job for 30 years. In that time, people have threatened to shoot me, to burn my house down. I’m not a macho man, but I’m just used to it. What I can’t abide, however, is a president who misleads workers, who gives them false hope. We’re not asking for anything besides opportunity, for jobs that let people provide for their families. These plants are profitable, and the workers produced a   product. Because of corporate greed, though, company leaders are racing to the bottom, to find places where they can pay the least. It’s a system that exploits everyone. Read more: Donald Trump was my hero. Until I tried to sell talking Trump novelty pens. I sold Trump $100, 000 worth of pianos. Then he stiffed me.

","         There’s no doubt that   Donald Trump’s attack on United Steelworkers Local 1999 President Chuck Jones is disturbing for several reasons. It shows his   thin skin: Hillary Clinton may have lost, but “a man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons” remains as true as ever. It shows he still loves to bully critics, no matter how powerless they are, and he will continue to do so in a   fashion when he has the powers of the federal government at his disposal. And it shows he will double down when confronted with his own lies. But we knew all of these problems already. What’s new in Trump’s latest Twitter tirade is not his actions, but the target. Unlike Trump, who forgot he promised to help the Carrier workers USW Local 1999 represents, Jones has actually worked to save the plant’s jobs. Unlike Trump, who has shipped thousands of jobs overseas, Jones has fought to keep jobs in the United States. In Jones, Trump attacked someone who represents working America more authentically than Donald Trump ever has or ever will. But there were many voters who felt nevertheless that the plutocrat would fight for workers and create jobs. During the summer, Clinton’s campaign had some success against this with ads from   owners and others who had been stiffed by Trump, but they never committed to the attack like Obama did against Mitt Romney in 2012. The    was able to convince some voters that he actually cared about middle America. The fight with Jones is perhaps the most concrete example so far that, like virtually everything Donald Trump says, this is a lie. The   at Jones is only the first   example of Trump’s real attitude toward working Americans, and there will be many more to come. On Thursday, he picked   executive Andrew Puzder to run the Labor Department. Puzder, the latest millionaire to join Trump’s cabinet, fanatically opposes raising the minimum wage, claims workers prefer “stature” to overtime pay and speaks longingly of replacing human workers with robots. The examples will continue to pile up; it’s up to Democrats to capitalize on this by following the advice of people such as Sen. Bernie Sanders ( .) and emphasizing major reforms aimed at helping the poor and the middle class. One way to do so? Well, the value for Democratic politicians and liberal activists of getting on cable news, while always important, has now skyrocketed. Firing back on TV at Trump is all that it takes to get his attention and get days of free media coverage for ideas that actually help working Americans.

","     The front page of Thursday morning’s New York Times offers a graphic glimpse of a brutal extrajudicial “war on drugs” that apparently has a fan in   Donald Trump. A body lying in the street, doused by pouring rain. The headline, a quote from a Filipino at one of many graphic murder scenes depicted in the report, too scared to give his name: “They Are Slaughtering Us Like Animals. ” In a massive report, photojournalist Daniel Berehulak documents Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte’s savage crackdown on anyone suspected of drug involvement in his country  —   a crackdown that has reportedly claimed thousands of lives at the hands of police and thousands more at the hands of vigilantes empowered by the   crusade. He’s not the only one. Vital journalism on Duterte’s war has also come this week from Reuters, which focused on 51 shootings by police in drug busts. Those 51 shootings resulted in 100 suspects dead and three wounded, a 97 percent kill ratio  —   enough for Reuters to conclude that “officers are summarily gunning down suspects. ” For the New Yorker, Adrian Chen wrote a profile of Duterte, tracking his rise as a populist demagogue and detailing his position now, as a president delivering on violent promises. From a piece in the Atlantic by Ana P. Santos on the widows of Duterte’s drug war, here is a summary of how the Filipino leader pitched his effort on the campaign trail: When he campaigned for the presidency of the Philippines, Rodrigo Duterte promised to wage a deadly war on drugs. In fiery speeches, he called drugs “the evil that will destroy the country,” and said users were   beings who deserve to die. “Go ahead and kill them yourself as getting their parents to do it would be too painful,” he said in one speech. With hyperbolic flourish, he committed to killing 100, 000 criminals and dumping so many of their corpses in Manila Bay that the fishes would “grow fat” by feeding on them. “The funeral parlors will be packed.   …     I’ll supply the dead bodies,” he bragged. Duterte was pledging to do what no other president had managed to do: Go after drug traffickers and end drugs and criminality, all within a   timeline of three to six months. All of this would be important reporting anyway, but it has taken on an added significance since last week, when Trump spoke with Duterte over the phone and, according to Duterte, invited him to visit the White House next year and praised the war on drugs in the Philippines as the “right way. ” We should leave open the possibility that foreign leaders will misrepresent their conversations with Trump to advance their own goals. After all, there is almost no statement that could be attributed to Trump at this point that many in the world wouldn’t believe, and the apparently casual nature of these phone calls leaves them open to manipulation. But we have little evidence to doubt that Trump would see something in a strongman, or his tactics, to admire. He praised Russian President Vladimir Putin during the campaign and defended his own past comments in which he spoke of the violent crackdown on Chinese protesters in Tiananmen Square almost as if it were an inspiration. Duterte and Trump have apparently bonded to such a degree that Duterte unveiled a friendly impression of Trump on Wednesday. The two share a disdain for journalists, although Duterte has expressed his in more violent terms, once defending the killing of journalists. The way he did it, though, was positively Trumpian: “You are not exempted from assassination if you are a son of a b —  ” Duterte said. In some ways, Trump’s friendliness to Duterte is yet another example of his habit of making the implicit explicit. Although President Obama has offered tepid criticism of Duterte’s atrocities, Philippine police stations behind the killings continue to receive millions of dollars in aid from the United States. If Trump did tell Duterte that this was the “right way,” he would, in a sense, only be verbalizing what U. S. dollars flowing into the Philippines suggest. That doesn’t make it any less disturbing, particularly as Trump continues to fill his Cabinet with generals and   crusaders like presumptive attorney general Jeff Sessions. For all the problems with America’s own disastrous drug war, this is not the Philippines. But we’ve seen just this week that some Americans are willing to excuse what amounts to an extrajudicial killing if it involves the right sort of people. It would bring some measure of relief if the   didn’t strike up friendships with leaders who see such killings as a best practice."

","     If you’re still confused about why Democrats lost the election, look no further than the issues they prioritize. Instead of focusing on jobs, the economy and national security, the Democrats obsess over climate change, bathroom breaks and, curiously, sanctuary cities. Now is a good time for the Republicans to pick some fights, and the issue of sanctuary cities is a prime target. It’s a perfect reminder of what Democrats have become. As my old boss Lee Atwater used to say, “Never kick a man when he is up. ” And right now, the Democrats are down, divided and in disarray. The issue of sanctuary cities is one that is ripe for Republicans, if for no other reason than the Democrats’ position is so indefensible. The very idea that city officials will blatantly disobey the law in furtherance of aiding foreign nationals who have entered city limits illegally is wrong on so many levels. Republicans should seize the opportunity to make the Democrats publicly defend their position. Following Donald Trump’s election, liberals jumped to the defense of sanctuary cities, pledging to maintain sanctuary cities and protect illegal immigrants from the Trump administration. Mayor Rahm Emanuel said outright that Chicago will always be a sanctuary city, sending a message to anyone who was “very nervous and filled with anxiety” after Trump’s win that “you are safe in Chicago, you are secure in Chicago, and you are supported in Chicago. ” There is always a lot of talk about what presidents are going to do on their first day in office. Well, I hope that on Sen. Jeff Sessions’s ( .) first day in office as attorney general, he’ll make his presence known with   officials who are flouting the law. I applaud Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, who has already issued an order cutting funding to sanctuary cities and who plans to follow that up with an outright ban on sanctuary cities in his state. But he needs reinforcement from the national Republican Party and from Washington, D. C. It’s time to take the fight to the Democrats and others who want to push sanctuary cities in defiance of federal law. Hopefully, the Republicans will reintroduce Sen. Patrick J. Toomey’s ( .) Stop Dangerous Sanctuary Cities bill, which withholds federal funding from those who refuse to cooperate with Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials, and Sen. Ted Cruz’s ( .) Kate’s Law, which also aims to coerce cities into cooperating with ICE and is named after Kate Steinle, who was murdered at random in sanctuary city San Francisco by an illegal immigrant who had already been deported five times. It’s time for Republicans to challenge Democrats on this issue. As long as Trump is still tweeting too much, this is worth a tweet."

","     This is a developing story. This post will be updated. A massive earthquake erupted along a fault line near the Solomon Islands in the southwest Pacific Ocean on Thursday. The quake was originally detected as a   by the U. S. Geological Service, but has since been reduced to a 7. 8 on the   scale. It was followed by a 5.  quake, and aftershocks continue to roll through. Immediately after the quake, a tsunami watch was issued for Hawaii by the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center. Water height fluctuations were recorded by at least three surrounding buoys, but after investigating, the center determined there was no threat to the island state. “I always want to tell people that there’s possibility, with a quake this size, there’s certainly a possibility,” Don Blakeman, a geophysicist for the USGS, told Hawaii News Now. As a precaution, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center, part of NOAA, issues a watch immediately after any earthquake that has the potential to generate a tsunami. It then analyzes the data to determine the threat, at which point it is changed to a warning or advisory, or canceled altogether.    Estimated shake intensity. (USGS)  Moderate to heavy shaking was reported on the island of Makira, which was the closest to the epicenter of the quake. Strong shaking was reported near the capital of Honiara, north of the epicenter. Over 500, 000 people live on the archipelago located east of Papua New Guinea. In 2007, a   earthquake struck the islands and generated a tsunami that may have been over 30 feet high, according to the Solomon Islands Foreign Office, though it’s difficult to pinpoint the exact height. In nearby Australia, the Bureau of Meteorology has given the   after Thursday’s quake. No tsunami is expected there. Thursday’s earthquake is tied for the strongest on Earth in 2016 with the Ecuador, New Zealand and Indonesia quakes. More than 650 people died when the 7. 8 earthquake rocked Ecuador on April 16. Earlier on Thursday, a 6.  quake rumbled off the coast of Northern California just before 7 a. m. Pacific time. The epicenter was just 6. 2 miles deep, which is a very shallow earthquake, though no tsunami warnings were issued. Even though the quake was considered strong, it did not translate into strong shaking in California."

","  PARIS  —   Russia said late Thursday that the Syrian military has suspended its combat operations in eastern Aleppo to allow civilians to leave the city and that it had reached agreement with the United States to negotiate the safe departure of rebel fighters. A senior U. S. State Department official here traveling with Secretary of State John F. Kerry said that neither of those assertions could yet be confirmed but that Kerry was in contact with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov. There were conflicting reports from inside Aleppo, where some residents reported a sudden quiet, but others said neighborhoods were still under fire. On Wednesday, as many as 150 elderly residents of Aleppo’s Old City were evacuated by the government in a joint operation with the International Red Cross.  Lavrov, speaking to Russian journalists in Hamburg, said a much bigger evacuation was underway. “Yet another and the biggest [operation] so far . . . to evacuate the civilians willing to leave the place is underway there,” he said, according to Russia’s   Tass news agency. “There are some 8, 000 people in the column. That’s a huge operation, and the withdrawal route is five kilometers long. ” Kerry and Lavrov met twice Thursday morning in Hamburg, where they were attending an international conference. Kerry left at midday for Paris, and the two spoke again by telephone in the afternoon, said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the diplomatic contacts. The White House, which has long been skeptical of Moscow’s sincerity in its discussions on Syria, reacted guardedly. “Our approach to this situation from the beginning has been to listen carefully to what the Russians say but scrutinize their actions,” press secretary Josh Earnest said. Last summer, the United States suspended military and diplomatic “expert” talks with Russia in Geneva over a possible   in Syria when the Syrian government’s siege of eastern Aleppo began, aided by Russian air attacks. A ferocious government ground offensive in the past few weeks, with hundreds of reported civilian deaths, has retaken all but about a quarter of the territory the opposition once held in the city. As many as 200, 000 civilians, and several thousand rebels, are said to remain there.  Lavrov said that he and Kerry had reached agreement to restart the Geneva talks on Saturday to determine “the ways and methods of a final settlement of the eastern Aleppo problem through the departure of all militants and those civilian residents, who will wish to do so, from there,” the Russian news agency Interfax reported from Hamburg. The State Department official said the resumption of expert talks had been “discussed” but had not been finalized as of late Thursday. The immediate   discussions are about evacuating Aleppo and “determining the timing, the safety and where [opposition fighters and civilians] are going to go,” the State Department official said. France will host a meeting here Saturday morning of the United States and other governments in Europe and the region of the conflict to discuss the process. The hope is that talks in Geneva will move quickly to a     that will allow the delivery of humanitarian aid to hundreds of thousands in besieged communities across the western third of the country, and to restart political talks between the opposition and the government of President Bashar   over a political transition. Given that more than a year of    negotiations have failed to halt the carnage in Syria, optimism was tempered. “If that occurs, we obviously would welcome that development,” Earnest said. “It won’t be some sort of accident or coincidence. . . . It will be the product and the result of skilled, principled, tough, tenacious diplomacy, and much of the credit will go to Secretary Kerry. ” “But we’ll see what happens,” he said.

142141,217519,Harry Reid bids farewell to the Senate where he was both warrior and deal-maker,Washington Post,Paul Kane,2016-12-08,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161208231150/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2016/12/08/harry-reid-bids-farewell-to-the-senate-where-he-was-both-warrior-and-deal-maker/
","     To understand Harry Reid  —   his soft spoken nature mixed with a brusque demeanor, his early conservative views combined with his modern status as liberal icon  —   one has to understand Searchlight, Nev. One has to understand how much the retiring Senate minority leader hated his hometown, a    place that was all bust in his childhood, how much he ran away from that wretched town when he started to make it in Las Vegas as a politically connected lawyer, how ashamed he was of a place that drove his father to kill himself. But one has to also understand how, once he embraced his roots, literally after hearing a speech from the author of “Roots,” Alex Haley, Reid set himself on a path to become a historical figure with a long legislative legacy  —   as he also became one of the most polarizing figures the Senate has ever known. “He said be proud of who you are. You can’t escape who you are,” Reid recalled Thursday of Haley’s talk. “And I walked out of that event that night a different person, a new man. From that day forward, I was from Searchlight.   …     I became Harry Reid, the guy from Searchlight. ”      Take a tour of Las Vegas with retiring Sen. Harry Reid as he tells tales of his fight against the mob, an attempted car bombing, and his love of palm trees. (Dalton   Washington Post)   Usually a man of few words, Reid went on for nearly 80 minutes Thursday in his farewell address to the Senate, trying to explain the origins of that irascible style that defined his 30 years in the Senate. It comes from a childhood that reads like a   novel of despair. The Searchlight of Reid’s childhood was a town of 250 that had no churches, no indoor plumbing, 13 brothels, almost no active mines, and one teacher in the town’s only school, an elementary one, so he hitchhiked 40 miles each way to high school in Henderson. His father, a miner, hardly got paid and his mother helped the family survive by washing bedding and clothes from the local brothels. The future Senate leader’s proudest moment of his teenage years was saving up $250 from his gas station job to buy his mother a new set of teeth. [Harry Reid to lay aside gloves, retire from Senate] While his portrait was unveiled, Reid was celebrated late Thursday by Hillary Clinton and Vice President Biden who led a cascade of speeches in his honor. Clinton began her remarks joking about her campaign loss, saying her speech Thursday was “not exactly the speech in the Capitol” she had hoped to give. She noted that she, Biden and Reid were all leaving electoral politics at the same time and it was up to those still there to defend Reid’s accomplishments. “We’re all counting on you,” she said. Earlier in the day, after three decades in the Senate, four years in the House and almost 50 years of political combat in Nevada, the guy from Searchlight basked in the national political glow of a consequential career now passed. His longtime rival, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell ( .) praised Reid’s tenacity. “If there’s one thing we know about Harry, he doesn’t give up easily,” McConnell said, explaining Reid’s   style in the Senate and also his pursuit of his high school sweetheart, Landra Reid, whom he married at 19.      Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid ( .) bid farewell to the U. S. Senate, giving one last speech on the Senate floor on Dec. 8. ( )    Reid explained the personal side of why he used such an iron fist to win approval of the Affordable Care Act, infuriating Republicans as the   vote reshaped the health industry: His father, long battling depression without ever getting professional help, killed himself in 1972. “My Dad never had a chance. He was depressed always. He was reclusive,” he said, explaining that his father skipped many childhood events. “I think everyone can understand a little bit of why I have been such an avid supporter of Obamacare. ” [Harry Reid invokes father’s suicide in discussing gun control] Reid’s final speech had its share of partisan flare. Fewer than ten Republicans attended the morning address, and Reid did not mince words when he condemned Republicans for what he considered the “abuse of the filibuster” during his eight years as majority leader. His 2013 move to end filibusters on most presidential appointments still prompts anger among Republicans. Most Republicans complained that the Senate ground to a halt in his later years as majority leader as so many decisions were made inside Reid’s leadership suite on the second floor of the Capitol.  While he set aside Thursday his many feuds with Reid, McConnell’s mantra upon becoming majority leader two years ago was an attempt to repudiate his Democratic counterpart by putting the Senate “back in business” by allowing more votes and amendments from junior senators. Yet that portrait of Reid neglects the other side of the man who was, when he wanted to be, one of the best bipartisan   of his generation. On Thursday he recounted two early pieces of legislation that might drive today’s liberals crazy: a “Taxpayer Bill of Rights” that struck at the IRS’s power, and the Congressional Review Act, which Republicans have recently been using to attack Obama administration regulations. “It was great when we had Republican presidents, not so great when we had Democratic presidents. But it was fair,” Reid said, drawing laughter from his standard   humor. Reid served as one of the driving figures, along with McConnell, in securing the $700 billion bailout of big banks during the Wall Street implosion of 2008. And, before he became his party’s floor leader in 2005, Reid served on the Appropriations Committee with such Republican legends as Ted Stevens (Alaska) carving up the federal budget to deliver billions of dollars in federal spending to their respective states. This was the Las Vegas Harry Reid, the backroom negotiator who figured out everyone’s self interest and got the best deal for his state. Yet it was the Searchlight Harry Reid that turned him into the brawling figure who would go on to become the third longest serving majority leader in Senate history. It’s that spirit he channeled in becoming the intemperate figure who wouldn’t hesitate in calling   Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan “a hack” and   George W. Bush a “liar” who used Senate floor speeches to excoriate   Donald Trump as a “racist” and a “con man”. “I was ashamed, embarrassed about Searchlight,” Reid said. “When I went to college, was in high school, law school, I just didn’t want to talk about Searchlight. It was kind of embarrassed about it. It was kind of a crummy place. ” Once he embraced that side of his life, however, Reid found the passion that turned him into the figure  —   both revered and jeered at the same time  —   who he now is. He’s often asked how he got from Searchlight to the Senate. “And I tell them the same thing about working hard,” he said. “Of course that’s important. Of course it’s important  —   but also, stay true to who you are, your roots. ”"

","    Opioid deaths continued to surge in 2015, surpassing 30, 000 for the first time in recent history, according to CDC data released Thursday. That marks an increase of nearly 5, 000 deaths from 2014. Deaths involving powerful synthetic opiates, like fentanyl, rose by nearly 75 percent from 2014 to 2015.       Heroin deaths spiked too, rising by more than 2, 000 cases. For the first time since at least the late 1990s, there were more deaths due to heroin than to traditional opioid painkillers, like hydrocodone and oxycodone. In the CDC’s opioid death data, deaths may involve more than one individual drug category, so numbers in the chart above aren’t mutually exclusive. Many opioid fatalities involve a combination of drugs, often multiple types of opioids, or opioids in conjunction with other sedative substances like alcohol. In a grim milestone, more people died from   causes than from gun homicides in 2015. As recently as 2007, gun homicides outnumbered heroin deaths by more than 5 to 1.       These increases come amid a    increase in mortality across the board, resulting in the first decline in American life expectancy since 1993. Congress recently passed a spending bill containing $1 billion to combat the opioid epidemic, including money for addiction treatment and prevention. Much of the current opioid predicament stems from the explosion of prescription painkiller use in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Widespread painkiller use led to many Americans developing dependencies on the drugs. When various authorities at the state and federal levels began issuing tighter restrictions on painkillers in the late 2000s, much of that demand shifted over to the illicit market, feeding the heroin boom of the past several years.         Drug policy reformers say the criminalization of illicit and   drug use is a barrier to reversing the growing epidemic. “Criminalization drives people to the margins and dissuades them from getting help,” said Grant Smith, deputy director of national affairs at the Drug Policy Alliance. “It drives a wedge between people who need help and the services they need. Because of criminalization and stigma, people hide their addictions from others. ”"

This is no time to tune out.,Washington Post,Margaret Sullivan,2016-12-08,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161208231150/https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/sick-of-the-news-this-is-no-time-to-tune-out/2016/12/08/97ff1e70-bd61-11e6-91ee-1adddfe36cbe_story.html
"," In another strange time in American history, the counterculture guru Timothy Leary urged people to “turn on, tune in, drop out. ” Five decades later, it’s time for quite a different formula. In the era of fake news causing real trouble, and of the news media under fire for sins both justified and exaggerated, the better advice is this: Tune in and stay that way.  Since the election of Donald Trump one month ago, and the rush of news that has followed, I’ve heard many people say they need to take a break from what’s happening   .  Call it news fatigue. They don’t want to hear the latest upsetting developments: For example, the   has nominated for national security adviser a general who pushes conspiracy theories, and a climate change denier to head the EPA. And, separate from the news itself, many people don’t trust the media to be an impartial messenger.  As if more proof were necessary of the pollution in the media ecosystem, Facebook’s Sheryl Sandberg agreed, in a TV appearance Thursday, that fake news and willful propaganda are a serious issue, and that social media platforms need to take action. (She added that she does not believe it swayed the election results, a    matter of opinion.) One political journalist I know described what it’s like to report news at this moment: It’s like covering a “live shooter” situation, she said, but it continues day after day, with no end in sight. What’s a responsible citizen to do?  Evan McMullin, the former CIA operative who ran for president this year as an independent, has some good advice.  He sees the   as dangerous  —   with some of the same authoritarian behaviors as the dictatorial strongmen whose reigns he saw in his posts around the world.  As he tries to begin building a new conservative movement, McMullin this week wrote a New York Times opinion piece and a   Twitter series. Here’s No. 2: “Identify and follow many credible sources of news. Be very   and learn to discern truth from untruth. ” And be engaged: “Write, speak, act. ” There are positive signs that some Americans are tuning in. The New York Times and The Washington Post say subscriptions have soared since the election. The investigative outfit ProPublica, as well as other journalism nonprofit groups, report a flood of donations.  One Post reader wrote to me recently asking how her family’s foundation could help defend reporters against potential legal challenges. After conferring with Post Executive Editor Marty Baron, I suggested she consider a donation to the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press. She got back to me to say that they had done just that  —   to the tune of $10, 000. None of this is to suggest that the mainstream media, the “legacy press,” is faultless. It certainly isn’t, as is made abundantly clear in a new report from Harvard’s Shorenstein Center, “How the Press Failed the Voters. ” Examining campaign coverage by major newspapers and television networks, it makes a powerful case that the media often traffficked in false equivalencies between the two major candidates and focused too little on substance. In short, there’s plenty of blame to go around in this unsettled and unsettling moment. But the answer, surely, isn’t to play the ostrich card. Which brings us back around to Timothy Leary, who offered another piece of advice that holds up better than the one mentioned earlier: Think for yourself and question authority. Keen awareness  —   and critical thinking  —   will matter more than ever in the days ahead. It might be tempting, but whatever you do, don’t drop out.   For more by Margaret Sullivan, visit wapo.

","     “We should take great pride in the progress that we’ve made over the last eight years. That’s the bottom line. No foreign terrorist organization has successfully planned and executed an attack on our homeland. ”  —  President Obama, remarks at MacDill Air Force Base, Tampa, Fla. Dec. 6, 2016 President Obama made valedictory remarks about his administration’s approach to counterterrorism, and one line jumped across Twitter, sparking outrage.   Go to work fact checkers https:  .   —   Stephen Miller (@redsteeze) December 7, 2016     @GlennKesslerWP Why haven’t you   this blatant lie by our President? https:  .   —   Neil Frick (@NeilFrick) December 7, 2016   Many wondered how Obama could make this claim after such   terror attacks as the Dec. 2, 2015, attack in San Bernardino, in which a radicalized married couple killed 14 people and wounded 22; the Nov. 5, 2009, shooting at Foot Hood in Texas in which a radicalized U. S. Army major killed 13 people and wounded 32 others; and the Boston Marathon bombings on April 15, 2013, which killed two and wounded 132. But Obama’s speech did not ignore these cases, notwithstanding the snippets that appeared on Twitter. “The most deadly attacks on the homeland over the last eight years have not been carried out by operatives with sophisticated networks or equipment directed from abroad,” Obama said. “They’ve been carried out by   and largely isolated individuals who were radicalized online. ” Still, given the reader interest, Obama’s claim seemed worth checking  —   especially since the White House account also highlighted it.   ”Over last 8 years, no foreign terrorist organization has successfully planned and executed an attack on our homeland”  —  @POTUS  —   The White House (@WhiteHouse) December 6, 2016   The Facts We dug through the material in the authoritative Global Terrorism Database, maintained at the University of Maryland for the Department of Homeland Security, checking every terrorist incident recorded in the United States during Obama’s two terms. The GTD produced more than 100 incidents. But, for San Bernardino, the perpetrator group is listed as “unaffiliated individuals. ” The same label is applied to the Boston bombings and Fort Hood shootings, as well as other attacks. That’s because these attackers were inspired from overseas, but no evidence of any direct link to a foreign terror group ever has been found. In fact, during the course of Obama’s presidency, only one attack in the United States is linked to a foreign terrorism organization by the database: The 2009 Christmas Day attack. Here’s the GTD summary:   : On Friday morning, in Detroit, Michigan, United States, as the plane was approaching the destination, a   suicide bomber, identified as Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, a    Nigerian national, on board of Northwest Flight 253 from Amsterdam, Netherlands detonated a device that was attached to his body while on the plane. The bomb was a six inch packet of high explosives containing pentaerythritol, Triacetone Triperoxide, other materials and a syringe. The explosives were sewn into his underwear. The assailant was wounded and damage was done to the aircraft. A passenger who tried to put the explosion out was also injured. 290 people in total were on board. No other injuries or casualties were reported. Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula claimed responsibility. The GTD lists the attack as “unsuccessful. ” A video apparently released by the group in 2014 strongly suggested AQAP was closely involved in the attack. The video shows a short clip of Abdulmutallab, the bomber, together with both the group’s leader, Nasir   and   cleric Anwar   (who was later killed in a U. S. drone strike). Ned Price, spokesman for the White House national security council, said the incident actually proves Obama’s point: “The key is ‘successful,’ which this planned attack was not. And you’re right, the President was clear that it wasn’t for lack of trying. ” The Pinocchio Test   Donald Trump and his staff might take note of how carefully the Obama team crafted this sentence. Nothing was left to chance. By focusing on a “foreign terrorist organization,” the president leaves out   terrorists who might have been inspired by terror groups overseas. And by using the word “successfully,” the president manages to avoid having to acknowledge the one documented case that is clearly linked to a terror group. The president’s overall speech was more nuanced than suggested by the Twitter snippet released by the White House. But we are not sure whether such   is worth it. Seen in isolation, it will certainly raise questions from Americans who certainly have been frightened by many   terrorist incidents that took place in the United States under Obama’s watch. Obama’s statement is technically right, though perhaps not politically smart, especially if you tweet it to the world.

142145,217523,Clash over patent-office fraud a sign of what’s to come for federal workers,Washington Post,Lisa Rein,2016-12-08,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161208231150/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2016/12/08/clash-over-patent-office-fraud-a-sign-of-whats-to-come-for-federal-workers/
","     House Republicans on Wednesday dressed down a top U. S. Patent and Trademark Office official and a union leader for what they called a weak response to reports of time and attendance fraud by patent examiners. The rebukes, in response to an   investigation released this summer, may foreshadow things to come with President Donald Trump in the White House and Republicans controlling Congress. Trump and conservatives on Capitol Hill have vowed to target the federal bureaucracy, holding civil servants accountable when they perform poorly or break the rules  —   behavior they say has been tolerated by the Obama administration across the government with few repercussions. [Trump has a plan for government workers. They’re not going to like it.] The patent office has struggled in recent years with reports that some of its employees are chronically gaming the system, a practice made easier by the large number who work from home with little oversight by managers. The agency’s watchdog has found plenty of fodder. In 2014, the inspector general for the Commerce Department, the patent office’s parent, reported that paralegals at the small office that handles patent appeals were told by their supervisors to fudge their timecards because they had so little work to do. Also that year, The Washington Post reported on the findings of an internal investigation by patent officials after whistleblowers complained that their colleagues and examiners they supervise repeatedly lied about their hours and got overtime pay and bonuses for work they didn’t do. A   internal report revealed a culture of time and attendance abuse and scant oversight of the patent office’s   telework program. But top patent officials removed the most damaging revelations from the findings, providing the inspector general’s office with an account half the length and with many potentially embarrassing findings removed. Last year, investigators found that a single patent examiner racked up more than 18 weeks of pay for work he did not do, while his teleworking manager never noticed. [He billed the government for four months of work he never did, and his teleworking boss never noticed] And a   analysis, released in August by Deputy Inspector General David Smith, of thousands of patent examiners’ turnstile badge swipes, computer   and remote computer connections to federal systems showed consistent discrepancies between the time employees reported working and the hours they actually put in. This time and attendance abuse cost the government as much as $18. 3 million, with employees who review patent applications billing the agency for almost 300, 000 hours they never worked, investigators found. They said the full scale of the fraud is probably double what the numbers show, because they gave employees the benefit of the doubt: If they badged in once at the agency’s Alexandria headquarters or logged in at home, they got credit for a day of work. “What is most troubling is that the numbers . . . are a conservative estimate,” Rep. Mark Meadows ( . C.) chairman of the House Oversight Committee’s subcommittee on government operations, said at a hearing Wednesday. [Patent office filters out worst abuses in report to its watchdog] Meadows called the August report “alarming” and told a top patent official that “internal controls are lacking” to monitor fraud. “I want an accountable workforce going forward,” he said. Rep. Gerald E. Connolly ( .) the subcommittee’s top Democrat, said the inspector general had not made the case that fraud was widespread, noting the bogus hours accounted for only 1. 6 percent of the hours investigators tracked. [  workers bilked the government of millions by playing hooky, watchdog finds] The hearing focused on 415 employees who investigators said lied about working at least one day every other week  —   and 56 employees whose time could not be accounted for an average of three days a pay period. Russell Slifer, the patent office’s deputy director, told lawmakers that “any abuse of time and attendance . . . is unacceptable. ” He said the agency has taken steps to give managers more tools to monitor when their employees are working. [Read the   report here] But Slifer defended the agency’s roughly 8, 000 patent examiners, saying the vast majority are honest, hard workers, many of whom do not have enough time to review each application on their docket. He also said that many examiners do their research offline, so if they are not logged onto their computers for a day or even two, that does not mean they are playing hooky. Meadows was furious. “You’ve got over 8, 000 employees and 400 or so who are taking advantage of the system,” he told Slifer. “Are you suggesting it’s okay to not log into your computer for two days? Do you think you can actually do your work for 48 hours without logging in?” “Yes,” Slifer answered. “Is that the best practice?” Meadows asked. Slifer acknowledged that it was not. Patent officials have not been able to identify or interview or pursue disciplinary action against the 415 employees they think gamed the system; privacy laws prevent them from matching computer data gathered in the inspector general’s investigation with personnel records. Slifer said that 30 patent examiners the agency was investigating separately for time and attendance fraud have been disciplined or fired. He did not say over what period or how serious the fraud was. After the hearing, patent office spokesman Patrick Ross said in an email that officials would not provide further information. Cause of Action Institute, a watchdog group, said it filed a Freedom of Information Act request with the patent office in November seeking detailed records on disciplinary action. Republicans also criticized the union representing patent examiners, which has an unusually close relationship with management. Pamela Schwartz, president of the Patent Office Professional Association, was first grilled by Rep. Jody Hice ( .) on her   work for the union while on the federal payroll  —   a legal, widespread practice known as official time. Republicans have vowed to weaken or eliminate it. Meadows then called Schwartz to account for her advice to the patent examiner known as “Examiner A,” who bilked the government out of tens of thousands of dollars. The union had urged him to resign, which he did, before patent officials could fire him. Meadows asked the union leader: “So you advised the employee to resign” rather than face the consequences of his actions? “We advised the employee their record would have less on it if they resigned,” Schwartz said. Meadows asked her for a commitment that she would negotiate new language in the union contract that would allow managers to see their employees’ work schedules and make it easier to fire employees who commit fraud. “If they falsify records, are you willing to support their termination?” the congressman asked. Schwartz hedged and would not commit. “I would need clarification on that,” she said. “It’s possible you could falsify some records and the appropriate level of discipline would not be termination. ”"
142146,217524,He didn’t think his speeding was dangerous. Then he crashed and killed 3 people.,Washington Post,Dan Morse,2016-12-08,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161208231150/https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/public-safety/he-didnt-think-his-speeding-was-dangerous-then-he-crashed-and-killed-3-people/2016/12/07/671f5dc4-bcc6-11e6-ac85-094a21c44abc_story.html
"," There are the briefest of moments  —   just after he wakes  —   when the young man’s life seems normal.  Then he sees, again, where he is: jail. He quickly realizes why he landed there: speeding at 115 mph down a suburban Maryland road. And he is overcome by what he did: crashing into a car carrying a family of four to a high school play. Only one survived, a    girl. “I am just hoping, I am wishing, for the best way for her to be able to deal with it,” the driver, Ogulcan Atakoglu, 21, said in an interview Monday at the Montgomery County Correctional Facility. Atakoglu has pleaded guilty to three counts of vehicular manslaughter in the devastating Feb. 27 crash in Bethesda and is scheduled to be sentenced Friday.  During the   interview, Atakoglu spoke about his previous speeding infractions and promises to himself and to courts to slow down. “I thought I was changing myself in a lot of ways, but I never really reached the point of actually changing,” Atakoglu said. He had felt confident that he could handle the speed of a turbocharged BMW and that, unlike those who drink and drive, he posed no danger. “I was very naive at the time in a lot of ways,” he said. “There’s a lot of carelessness and invincibility in young people, and I think I was absolutely part of that. ”  Helena Buarque de Macedo, who survived the crash on River Road, is a junior at Walt Whitman High School. “She is doing as well as one could expect,” Principal Alan Goodwin said Wednesday. “Helena is a fine student. From the outside, she looks like a teenager who is engaged in school. ” Atakoglu faces up to 30 years in prison, 10 for each death. He will probably get less given Maryland’s history in vehicular manslaughter cases, which turn on gross negligence rather than intended harm. Prosecutors have said they will seek a “substantial period” of incarceration for Atakoglu. They cite the tragedy of the deaths, Atakoglu’s driving record, and how fast he was going, particularly on a busy road. “The defendant’s speed, given those factors, was extremely egregious,” Montgomery County Assistant State’s Attorney Christina Rodriguez said in court this summer. Prosecutors also are expected to argue for a strong message of deterrence, aimed at excessive speeding. Maryland sentencing guidelines, while not binding, call for a term ranging from several months to 12 years. In court filings Wednesday, Atakoglu’s attorney, David Felsen, argued for a sentence of 18 months or less, noting that Atakoglu has no criminal record, took blame for the crash immediately and pleaded guilty to spare the Buarque de Macedo family from having to go through a trial. “He never shirked his responsibility,” Felsen wrote. The attorney also cited the “precarious” nature of the crash site at the intersection with Braeburn Parkway and noted that in August, the Maryland Department of Transportation said it would make safety enhancements that include flashing lights to warn of drivers making turns. Friday’s sentencing before Circuit Judge Mary Beth McCormick will cover details of the crash and its aftermath. Atakoglu was driving west on River Road just before 7 p. m. on the night of the wreck, in a car leased by his father. He was headed to his parents’ home, where he lived, in the Rockville area.  More than two football fields away, in the oncoming lanes, a Volt driven by Michael Buarque de Macedo began turning left. In the next few seconds, police crash investigators later determined, Atakoglu flashed his lights and then applied his brakes. But for the driver of the Volt, in the dark and with headlights coming directly at him, it would have been hard to gauge the speed of the car headed toward his family. The front of the BMW rammed the right side of the Volt. Atakoglu got out. “I did it! It’s all my fault!” he yelled, according to what a witness told police. Atakoglu said he knew he was going fast but hadn’t been watching the speedometer. He was taken to a hospital with relatively minor injuries. He did not immediately know he had killed anyone. In the emergency room, a social worker told him. Montgomery County police were already working on the   investigation that resulted in his charges. They calculated that if he had been going the   speed limit, he would have been 446 feet away from the Volt as it passed through the intersection. Atakoglu pleaded guilty under a law that holds that his speed was a form of gross negligence. Prosecutors persuaded the judge to send him to jail immediately after his plea, pending sentencing. The move stunned Atakoglu, who broke into heaving sobs in court. At the jail interview, he was more quiet but shed tears and said he fears prison time. “I couldn’t not be worried,” he said. He tries to speak to his parents every day by phone. They also visit through a glass window and tell him to be strong even as their sorrow shows. “I’m their only child,” he said. “I never wanted to break their hearts. ” He sees a psychologist to help understand his pain but said he does not presume to know Helena Buarque de Macedo’s pain. “I can’t even imagine,” he said. “I just pray. I constantly pray for her. ”   Read more:    “Such a heinous crime. ” Judge sentences killer of    to decades in prison.

142147,217525,A disabled Air Force veteran needed a job. So Lowe’s hired him — and his service dog.,Washington Post,Amy B Wang,2016-12-08,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161208231150/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/inspired-life/wp/2016/12/08/a-disabled-air-force-veteran-needed-a-job-so-lowes-hired-him-and-his-service-dog/
","     While waiting in line at their local Lowe’s on Sunday, Judy and Brian Rose did a double take. Behind them, a golden retriever sauntered by wearing one of the home improvement store’s    employee vests. The dog didn’t seem to be accompanied by anyone at the time. And the vest looked so . . . official. “What’s up with the dog?” Brian Rose asked the cashier, laughing. The Abilene, Tex. couple was told the dog belonged to a store employee, a disabled veteran who had been hired for a   job a couple months before. “I’m a retired vet myself,” Brian Rose told The Washington Post. “So I was actually impressed, one, that they hired a disabled vet, but also [a vet] with a dog. Because the dog could be a liability if somebody tripped over him or if something happened to a customer . . . and they took the chance on him anyways, and I thought that’s pretty awesome. ”  Around the corner, Judy Rose spotted the employee in question. The dog, Charlotte, had since returned to his side. Not wanting to disturb them  —   but touched by the sight  —   Judy Rose snapped a photograph of the pair from the back. While leaving Lowe’s, she uploaded the picture to her Facebook page, intending to show it to her circle of friends. “I love Abilene Lowes, way to go!” she wrote on Facebook. “This is a disabled vet who struggled to get a job because he needs his service dog! Lowes hired them BOTH! !” The couple drove two blocks away to watch a movie. By the time they emerged from the theater, hours later, Judy Rose’s Facebook notifications had gone berserk. “That phone is going ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding,” Brian Rose said.  Her post would be shared tens of thousands of times, with accolades pouring in for Lowe’s, the veteran and Charlotte. Soon, the Lowe’s employee  —   an Air Force veteran named Clay Luthy  —   would also be inundated with media requests and attention. A Lowe’s spokeswoman said Luthy was not available for an interview Wednesday, but said that hiring him, along with Charlotte, was simply a matter of accommodating a qualified employee. “We were interviewing people for his position, and he was one of the applicants,” Jay Fellers, a Lowe’s human resources managers, told KRBC News. “And so he showed up for the interview and he had Charlotte with him. ” According to the station, Luthy asked during the interview process if having Charlotte at work with him every day would be a problem. The people at Lowe’s said no, then offered him the job weeks later. “I can’t stand sitting at home,” Luthy told the station. He noted that he had multiple deployments with the Air Force  —   once to Uzbekistan and twice to Qatar  —   and had to have multiple knee surgeries. “Instead of medications, I have Charlotte. . . . They schedule me in an area at least for a few hours where Charlotte can get a good break. ”  Luthy didn’t elaborate on his medical conditions, but Lowe’s spokeswoman Karen Cobb said reports that the dog helped him avoid falls were not true. Because    Charlotte may soon need to retire from her   duties, Luthy has been training a new golden retriever,    Lola, she said. Most Lowe’s branches allow   dogs in their stores anyway. “We welcome   pets and, obviously, service animals,” Cobb said. Lowe’s does not keep statistics on the number of service dogs who work with their owners at stores.    Tinley Farmer, 4, pets Charlotte, as her mother, Jessica, talks to Lowe’s employee Clay Luthy in Abilene, Tex. on Nov. 22. (Greg   Abilene   via AP)  Lowe’s officials said bringing Charlotte on board has not only benefited Luthy but also delighted customers. In many news stories about Luthy and Charlotte, the retriever can often be seen at the center of people’s attention. “Everybody loves Charlotte,” Luthy told the Abilene   noting that she is especially good at keeping children entertained while their parents shop. It helps that she has her own Lowe’s vest  —   which Luthy made out of an old Lowe’s apron, according to Cobb. “Clay has been so friendly to allow Charlotte to sit down and [be] pet and enjoy our customers that are coming in on a regular basis,” Fellers, the human resources manager, told KRBC. Shortly after their photo of Luthy and Charlotte went viral, Judy and Brian Rose returned to the store to meet Luthy in person  —   and to apologize that they had brought so much unexpected attention to him. “We were not trying to make a spectacle of him,” Brian Rose said of the photo. “We never expected it to go past friends. ” He said Luthy told them not to worry about it. And Charlotte seemed equally unfazed. “The dog is actually incredibly well behaved,” Brian Rose said. “The few minutes that we spoke to him, the dog just laid there. “She laid there and just kept her eyes on him everywhere he went. ”    Charlotte takes an employee break in an aisle at the Abilene Lowe’s.

"," President Obama has ordered a “full review” of Russian hacking during the November election, as pressure from Congress has grown for greater public understanding of exactly what Moscow did to interfere in the electoral process. “We may have crossed into a new threshold, and it is incumbent upon us to take stock of that, to review, to conduct some   to understand what has happened and to impart some lessons learned,” Obama’s counterterrorism and   adviser, Lisa Monaco, told reporters at a breakfast hosted by the Christian Science Monitor. Obama wants the report before he leaves office on Jan. 20, Monaco said. On Oct. 7, the intelligence community officially accused Moscow of seeking to interfere in the election through the hacking of “political organizations. ” Though the statement never specified which party, it was clear officials were referring to   into the computers of the Democratic National Committee and other Democratic Party groups. Hacked emails that were damaging to the party and its presidential nominee, Hillary Clinton, soon after appeared on websites such as WikiLeaks. The   statement said such leaks were “consistent” with the methods and motivations of   efforts. “We believe, based on the scope and sensitivity of these efforts, that only Russia’s   officials could have authorized these activities,” the statement said.     The Post’s Ellen Nakashima goes over the events, and discusses the two hacker groups responsible. (Jhaan   Washington Post)    Seven Democratic senators last week asked Obama to declassify more details about the intrusions and why officials believe the Kremlin was behind the operation. And this week, top Democratic lawmakers in the House sent a letter to Obama urging briefings on Russian interference in the election. Leading Senate Republicans say they are preparing to launch a   probe into Russia’s meddling in the election and into potential cyberthreats to the military.  U. S. intelligence and law enforcement agencies had already been probing what they see as a broad covert Russian operation to sow distrust in the presidential election process. It was their briefings of senior lawmakers that led a number of them to press for more information to be made public.  Monaco said Obama has directed the intelligence community to capture “lessons learned and report to a range of stakeholders,” including lawmakers. She did not commit to making the report public. She noted the increase in malicious   in recent years. Russia has overtaken China as the country of primary concern in the cyberthreat space, intelligence officials have said.      Sen. Lindsey Graham ( . C.) says he wants to investigate whether Russia interfered with the 2016 U. S. election, amongst claims that Donald Trump’s rhetoric on Russia and Vladimir Putin is too soft. (Peter   Washington Post)   Though Russia has long conducted cyberspying on U. S. agencies, companies and organizations, this presidential campaign marks the first time Russia has attempted through cyber means to interfere in, if not actively influence, the outcome of an election, the officials said. The review comes as   Donald Trump has again dismissed the intelligence community’s findings about Russian hacking and meddling. “I don’t believe they interfered” in the election, he told Time magazine this week. The hacking, he said, “could be Russia. It could be China. And it could be some guy in New Jersey. ” Rep. Adam Schiff ( .) the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said Friday, “Given   Trump’s disturbing refusal to listen to our intelligence community and accept that the hacking was orchestrated by the Kremlin, there is an added urgency to the need for a thorough review before President Obama leaves office next month. ”     "
142150,217532,Trump transition team for Energy Department seeks names of employees involved in climate meetings,Washington Post,Steven Mufson,2016-12-09,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161210000446/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2016/12/09/trump-transition-team-for-energy-department-seeks-names-of-employees-involved-in-climate-meetings/
","       Donald Trump’s transition team has issued a list of 74 questions for the Energy Department, asking agency officials to identify which employees and contractors have worked on forging an international climate pact as well as domestic efforts to cut the nation’s carbon output. The questionnaire requests a list of those individuals who have taken part in international climate talks over the past five years and “which programs within DOE are essential to meeting the goals of President Obama’s Climate Action Plan. ”  Trump and his team have vowed to dismantle specific aspects of Obama’s climate policies. The questionnaire, which one Energy Department official described as unusually “intrusive” and a matter for departmental lawyers, has raised concern that the Trump transition team is trying to figure out how to target the people, including civil servants, who have helped implement policies under Obama. Thousands of scientists have signed petitions calling on the   and his team to respect scientific integrity and refrain from singling out individual researchers whose work might conflict with the new administration’s policy goals. This potential clash could prompt a major schism within the federal government, with many career officials waging a battle against incoming political appointees. While there have been many instances of political appointees and career scientists clashing in various administrations, what appears to be novel here is the request for the names of so many individual scientists, and the fact that it comes during the transition period, before the Trump administration has even taken power. This may be a signal of even more intense politicization after the inauguration. Yale University environmental historian Paul Sabin said in an interview that previous administrations have worked to install   energy and environmental experts in key agencies, often at the expense of employees from previous administrations. “But what seems unusual is singling people out for a very specific substantive issue, and treating their work on that substantive issue as, by default, contaminating or disqualifying,” Sabin said, adding that officials can now track a civil servant’s past activities “in such a systematic way. ” During Ronald Reagan’s time, when his political appointees sparred with officials at the Interior Department and the Environmental Protection Agency, Sabin noted, “it would have been so much harder to collect it on paper and track it down. ” Trump’s transition team did not respond to a request for comment. White House Deputy Press Secretary Eric Schultz told reporters that he could not speak to the questionnaire directly, saying, “If you have questions about activity that the  ’s team is doing, you should check in with them and try and figure out why they’re doing it. ” But Schultz added: “All I can tell you is that President Obama is enormously proud of the work of civil servants and federal workers across the administration, that over the past eight years they’ve worked to make this country stronger. And they don’t do so out a sense of great pay or because the hours are great. They do so out of a sense of patriotism. And the president’s proud of their record. ” The questionnaire was first reported by Bloomberg News. The Washington Post has obtained its own copies of both the initial document and one with some of the agency’s replies filled in, in addition to confirmation from other people in the department. Rep. Bill Foster ( .) a physicist, warned that the questionnaire “threatens to undo decades of progress we have made on climate change,” and Sen. Edward J. Markey ( .) said punishing civil servants for their work under previous administrations “would be tantamount to an illegal   political witch hunt and would have a profoundly chilling impact on our dedicated federal workforce. ” The document spanned a broad area of Energy Department activities, including its loan program, technology research program, responses to Congress, estimates of offshore wind and cleanup of uranium at a site once used by the military for weapons research. In many cases, the inquiries meshed with the priorities of conservative groups such as the Heritage Foundation, which held a meeting on energy and environment issues in Washington on Thursday, as well as priorities outlined in a recent fundraising pitch sent by the American Energy Alliance (AEA) a wing of the Institute for Energy Research. Thomas Pyle, who heads AEA, leads Trump’s Energy Department transition team. In a recent fundraising pitch, Pyle wrote supporters: “After eight years of the Obama administration’s divisive energy and environmental policies, the American people have voted for a change  —   a big change. We expect the Trump administration will adopt   and   policies  —   much different than the Obama administration’s   government approach. ” One question zeroed in on the issue of the “social cost of carbon,” a way of calculating the consequences of greenhouse gas emissions. The transition team asked for a list of department employees or contractors who attended interagency meetings, the dates of the meetings, and emails and other materials associated with them. The social cost of carbon is a metric that calculates the cost to society of emitting a ton of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. The Obama administration has used this tool to try to calculate the benefits of regulations and initiatives that lead to lower greenhouse gas emissions. At Thursday’s Heritage meeting, senior fellow David Kreutzer attacked the idea of using the social cost of carbon during the regulatory process. He said it “actually can be considered a fiction, the way it’s produced in the EPA right now,” adding that it “is supposedly a measure of the damage done to the world economy for each ton of carbon emitted in a given year. ” Kreutzer is a member of Trump’s Environmental Protection Agency transition team; Trump recently named Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt, who is suing the EPA over its environmental regulations, to head the EPA.  Another question appeared to delve deeply into the mechanisms behind scientific tools called “integrated assessment models,” which scientists use to forecast future changes to the climate and energy system. It also asked what the Energy Department considers to be “the proper equilibrium climate sensitivity,” which is a way climate researchers calculate how much the planet will eventually warm, depending on the amount of greenhouse gases emitted into the atmosphere. “My guess is that they’re trying to undermine the credibility of the science that DOE has produced, particularly in the field of climate science,” said Rob Jackson, a Stanford climate and energy researcher, in response to the question about the integrated assessment models. The questionnaire also appeared to take aim at the national laboratories, which operate with a high degree of independence but are part of the Energy Department. The questionnaire asked for a list of the top 20 salaried employees of the labs, the labs’   publications over the past three years, a list of their professional society memberships, affiliations, and the websites they maintain or contribute to “during work hours. ” Researchers at national labs focus on a range of issues, including   development and climate analysis. Career Energy officials who are the designated liaisons to the Trump transition team are allowed to disclose only publicly available information, unless it is in the context of a classified briefing to transition team members who have obtained security clearance through the White House. A response to the question about the top 20 salaried employees read: “DOE does not collect this information. This would require a call to the Labs, and the information is not available publicly. ” The department gave a similar to reply to questions about professional society memberships, websites they maintain or contribute to, and paid and unpaid positions. The transition team questionnaire also asked how to keep open aging nuclear power plants, restart the controversial Yucca Mountain nuclear waste site shelved by Obama and support the licensing of small modular reactors. It included 15 questions for the Energy Information Administration, some of them routine but some questioning the way the agency uses data about energy production. The questions called to mind past cases of conflicts between Republican administrations and federal agency scientists, on the environment and other matters. In Reagan’s first term, Anne Gorsuch was appointed to head the Environmental Protection Agency amid a major push for regulatory rollback. But after Gorsuch resigned amid controversy in 1983, Congress opened investigations into supposed “hit lists” at the agency used to track the views of members of scientific advisory boards, according to contemporary news reports. During the George W. Bush administration, there were complaints that scientific documents had been edited to raise doubts about the science of climate change and that researchers had been prevented from speaking openly to the media and sharing their expertise. In late 2010, the Obama administration issued   “scientific integrity” guidelines aimed at shielding federal scientists from political interference, part of an effort to distinguish itself from the Bush administration. The   memo, written by John Holdren, director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, included a prohibition against agency leaders or public affairs officers asking or demanding federal scientists to alter or suppress their findings. It also instructed agencies to “involve science and technology experts where appropriate” to craft “policymaking of the highest integrity. ”  Energy Department officials have not yet decided how to respond to the questions targeting the agency’s climate activities, according to federal officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. “With some of these questions, it feels more like an inquisition than a question, in terms of going after career employees who have been here through the Bush years to Clinton, and up to now,” said one current Energy Department employee. “All of a sudden you have questions that feel more like a congressional investigation than an actual probing of how the Department of Energy does its job. ” Michael Halpern, deputy director of the Union of Concerned Scientists’ Center for Science and Democracy, called the memo’s demand that Energy officials identify specific employees “alarming. ” “If the Trump administration is already singling out scientists for doing their jobs, the scientific community is right to be worried about what his administration will do in office. What’s next? Trump administration officials holding up lists of ‘known climatologists’ and urging the public to go after them?” Halpern asked. He added that lawmakers have attacked   scientists in the past for doing “work they find inconvenient. It seems that they are about to get accomplices in the Department of Energy. But don’t expect the federal workforce to simply roll over. The new administration will find thousands of federal workers who still believe in their departmental mission and will work hard to resist attacks on their peers. Scientists outside government are standing by to expose these actions and fight back. ” Christine McEntee, the executive director of the American Geophysical Union, a large society of Earth scientists, added in response to the questionnaire that “we don’t know at AGU the intent of all these questions, but if you look at them without knowing that intent, they are raising alarm for us. ” McEntee said that in general, when it comes to politics and science under Trump, “we’re hearing a lot from members, they’re quite concerned. ” At the American Geophysical Union meeting in San Francisco this month, where more than 20, 000 scientists gather annually, there will be sessions on the consequences of the election for science and on giving publicly funded scientists legal advice on how to respond to requests for their communications, she said. The Trump transition team’s meetings with Energy Department officials so far have excluded political appointees, one current official said. At the Defense Department, Trump transition officials are having multiple meetings a day with Pentagon personnel but in some cases have asked Obama administration political appointees not to attend those meetings, officials there said.

","   Donald Trump is assembling a national security team dominated by retired generals who share a deep distrust of Iran and have characterized the threat of militant Islam in far more dire terms than Obama administration officials and intelligence assessments. The trio of   represents an emerging core of the Trump administration that is at odds with President Obama’s efforts to convince the American public that  —   15 years after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks  —   terrorism continues to pose a persistent threat to the nation, but not an existential one. The generals’ views also cut against the grain of U. S. policies seeking to empower moderates in Iran and of U. S. intelligence assessments that terrorism no longer stands alone atop the rankings of global security threats now crowded by concerns about cyberattacks and renewed aggression by China and Russia. Their views, though far from uniform, have been heavily influenced over the past 15 years by intensely personal battlefield losses, the country’s waning attention to the wars and an   view of a ruthless enemy. Those experiences could lead retired Gens. Michael T. Flynn, James N. Mattis and John F. Kelly to urge caution in Trump administration debates about the use of force. But former colleagues and experts said the generals are also more likely, by virtue of their training and experience, to see malign intent or view the world as a struggle between good and evil.       Donald Trump has already tapped three former generals to serve in his administration. The Washington Post’s Jenna Johnson explains what attracts Trump to these men. (Bastien   Washington Post)    “The nature of the job in the military is to be responsible for threats against the nation and to be blamed if the country is not prepared,” said Stephen Biddle, a professor at George Washington University and frequent adviser to the U. S. military in Iraq and Afghanistan. “They tend to be very   in relation to civilians and tend to see that threat in more apocalyptic terms. ” Statements and online postings by Flynn, Trump’s choice for national security adviser, have drawn the most alarm among intelligence analysts and the   establishment. “We’re in a world war, but very few Americans recognize it, and fewer still have any idea how to win it,” Flynn wrote in his recent book “The Field of Fight. ” He has also repeatedly depicted Islam as a diseased religion that represents a growing danger. “Fear of Muslims is rational,” he wrote in a posting to his Twitter account earlier this year.  Mattis and Kelly  —   Trump’s respective nominees for secretary of defense and secretary of homeland security  —   have been far more measured in their   pronouncements and are widely respected within the   establishment and among the United States’ Gulf Arab allies. Yet each has expressed   views about Iran and the threat of terrorism. “Our country today is in a    struggle against an evil enemy, but America as a whole is certainly not at war,” Kelly said in late 2010, just days after his son, an officer leading Marines in Afghanistan, was killed. “Not as a country. Not as a people. ”     Here are the people whose names have been floated for Trump’s Cabinet View Graphic     Here are the people whose names have been floated for Trump’s Cabinet  Mattis’s persistent warnings about the threat posed by Iran led to tensions with the White House, which urged him when he was in uniform to tone down his rhetoric. He has criticized the Obama administration for taking too passive an approach to Iranian aggression and fostering “the impression in the region that the U. S. was withdrawing. ” In a speech in April, Mattis described the Iran deal as one “drawn up with the expectation that Iran will cheat. ” He said that one of its principal advantages would be that “we’ll have better targeting data should it come to a fight at some point in the future. ” “We’re going to have to plan for the worst,” Mattis said.  Obama has mounted an aggressive campaign to kill senior   and Islamic State leaders and wrest back territory seized by the extremists in Iraq and Syria. But he has also emphasized that the groups are not “the vanguard of a new world order. ” “These terrorists can never directly destroy our way of life, but we can do it for them if we lose track of who we are and the values that this nation was founded upon,” the president said in a speech earlier this week.  The three generals also share a widely held frustration in the military that they have been fighting for 15 years without the full support of the country or its civilian leaders. “All of us who served and fought in Iraq and Afghanistan, month after month, year after year, have been too close to the human costs  —   our buddies killed in action and our Iraqi and Afghan partners assassinated,” said J. Kael Weston, a State Department official who advised Marine officers in Iraq and Afghanistan and wrote “The Mirror Test,” a memoir of his service. “But the policymakers in D. C. have been too far removed from the   tally of war. ” When Mattis retired from the Marines in 2013, he spent two weeks zigzagging across the country visiting the parents of Marines killed under his command. Kelly and his two sons have taken part in more than a dozen combat tours in Iraq and Afghanistan. When his son’s platoon was deployed to Afghanistan in 2010, he made weekly and sometimes daily trips to visit his son’s wounded Marines at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Md. Those trips continued after his son was killed in combat. Flynn, who served in Afghanistan and as the Joint Special Operations Command’s senior intelligence officer, has spent as much time deployed to war zones as almost any other general in the Army over the past 15 years. The disconnect between the generals and Washington also extended to the battlefield, where military officers often felt compelled to describe the messy wars to their troops as battles between good and evil. “When you explain to a lance corporal why his best friend got horribly killed and he has to go out there again and again and again, you don’t have time for geo politics,” said retired Lt. Col. John Nagl, an Iraq veteran and counter insurgency expert. “You tell him, ‘We have to fight the enemy here so that we don’t have to fight them at home.’ ” A big question is how the perspectives of senior military officers, serving in   positions, will influence the direction of a Trump administration. Obama’s deep skepticism of foreign intervention meant that he often served as a brake on discussions about how the United States might respond to hostile developments overseas. Trump has no   or military experience to examine for insights into how he might respond, but his campaign posture was animated mainly by the promise of aggression. “I think it’s likely there will be terrorist attacks in the coming years, and I think Trump will feel tremendous pressure to be seen as acting very decisively,” said Dan Byman, a former Middle East analyst at the CIA and a professor at Georgetown University. Trump’s advisers may be quicker to see nefarious intent because of their military experience, he said, but be more cautious about U. S. military intervention or retaliation. Byman cited the example of the Iranian seizure of American sailors shortly before the Iran nuclear deal was signed as an example of an overseas provocation that had the potential to derail broader U. S. policy goals. Trump’s advisers “have a lot of personal experience and might be more inclined to see Iranian hostility as deeply planned,” rather than the act of a rogue faction or a function of chaos, Byman said. “They’re more likely to read things negatively than the Obama administration would have. ” “In significant ways, the chances for limited conflict with Iran go up,” Byman said. “But that doesn’t mean, to me, we bomb them. ”     "

","     Rudolph W. Giuliani, a former New York mayor and an early backer of Donald Trump, has withdrawn his name for consideration for a Trump administration job. Giuliani was on the  ’s shortlist for secretary of state.  In a statement, the Trump transition team said Giuliani informed Trump of his withdrawal at a Nov. 29 meeting. Giuliani delivered a letter to Trump, who declined to accept it at that meeting. On Friday, Giuliani again asked Trump to withdraw his name, and he accepted, according to a senior transition official. Giuliani said in a statement that the decision was “not about me. ” “It is about what is best for the country and the new administration,” he said. “Before I joined the campaign I was very involved and fulfilled by my work with my law firm and consulting firm, and I will continue that work with even more enthusiasm. ” “From the vantage point of the private sector, I look forward to helping the   in any way he deems necessary and appropriate,” he added. In a statement, Trump called Giuliani a “close personal friend” whom he would continue to call upon for advice while in office. “Rudy would have been an outstanding member of the Cabinet in several roles, but I fully respect and understand his reasons for remaining in the private sector,” Trump added. The   search for a secretary of state has left two names near the top of the list: former Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney and Exxon Mobil chief executive Rex Tillerson. Both men are valued by Trump for their experience in dealmaking around the world in their capacities as business executives. But Romney has faced a public revolt from Trump loyalists who believed that his comments during the campaign denouncing Trump went too far.  Giuliani was backed by the loyal political outsiders within Trump’s inner circle. But his candidacy faced challenges, including questions about potential conflicts raised by the work his consulting business did on behalf of foreign governments. However, Trump’s incoming chief of staff, Reince Priebus, pointedly sought to address speculation that conflicts might have imperiled Giuliani’s path to Senate confirmation. Giuliani “was vetted by our team for any possible conflicts and passed with flying colors,” Priebus said. “The team appreciates Rudy’s contributions to the victory and considers him a close friend and adviser. ”"
142153,217535,Donald Trump is solving his gender problem by making the Hill GOP’s worse,Washington Post,Amber Phillips,2016-12-09,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161210000446/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/12/09/donald-trump-is-solving-his-gender-problem-by-making-the-hill-gops-worse/
","     After a slow start,   Donald Trump appears to be making a concerted effort to place women in his Cabinet. That’s great for the women he chooses. It’s not so great for those they leave behind: Each time he chooses a GOP female elected official, he’ll be reducing the GOP’s already slim ranks of female elected officials. Perhaps the best illustration of this is Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers ( .) widely expected to be named Trump’s pick for interior secretary in the coming days. If confirmed by the Senate, she’d be only the third female interior secretary in U. S. history. But Trump would also be taking House Republicans’   woman out of the chamber entirely. In fact, he’d be taking their only female leader in 2017. (By comparison, Democrats just elected two women to leadership positions.) The departure of McMorris Rodgers from Congress would underscore a challenge her party has struggled with for decades: its difficulty elevating women to leadership roles. If you’re a woman in Congress  —   and only 20 percent of Congress is female, despite women making up 50 percent of the population  —   there’s a 3 to 1 chance you’re a Democrat. Democrats have simply been investing in recruiting women longer than Republicans have, and women voters tend to lean more Democratic than Republican.  For most of the 2000s, the ranks of Republican women in Congress have been stagnant, at about 10 percent of the GOP caucus. (They’ll start 2017 with 21 GOP House lawmakers, which is par for the course.) When my colleague Elise Viebeck asked where all the   GOP women are, she found Republicans had added a net of only two new female lawmakers and virtually no women in leadership (besides McMorris Rodgers, in her role as chair of the House Republican Conference) in more than a decade. (Rep. Lynn Jenkins ( .) was elected vice chair of the House Republican Conference  in 2012, but she’ll step down from that job next year to consider a run for governor of Kansas in 2018.) So it stands to reason that Republicans will want to replace McMorris Rodgers with a woman. But who? Underscoring their gender parity problem, there’s no obvious choice. What would traditionally be considered her most likely successor  —   the incoming vice chair for 2017  —   is a man. At least three women are thinking about running for the vacancy, Politico has reported.  Rep. Mimi Walters ( . ): Elected in 2014 to an Orange County area district, her GOP class also elected her as their representative to the House Republican Conference that McMorris Rodgers chairs. Rep. Susan Brooks ( . ): Elected in 2012 to represent the suburbs of Indianapolis, Brooks briefly ran for governor when Trump chose   Gov. Mike Pence to be his vice president, and she’ll start 2017 as chair of the House Ethics Committee. Rep. Mia Love ( ): Elected to a swing district in 2014, Love is the first black Republican woman to be elected to Congress.  All three of these women are relatively new to the Hill, which brings me to my next point: When women run for office, they win at the same rate as men, said Debbie Walsh of the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University. There just aren’t enough women running, especially Republican women. Of the 10 viable Senate candidates in 2016, just three were Republican.      Some Republican female leaders think Trump didn’t do them any favors in terms of recruiting women to replace ones he’s taking from them. But of course, it isn’t all on Trump: Well before his election, Republicans were struggling with gender diversity at all levels of government. While Democrats elected three new women of color to the Senate in November, bringing their total to 16, Republicans lost one of their women, knocking down their total from six to five. And as Trump tapped Gov. Nikki Haley of South Carolina to be his United Nations ambassador, GOP female governors’ ranks slimmed from three to two. (Actually, both parties severely lack female governors. Democrats have two right now. And GOP female governors could rise back up to three if Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad (R) is confirmed to be Trump’s ambassador to China. He’d be replaced by Lt. Gov. Kim Reynolds (R) who could become the first female governor of Iowa.) If Republican women simply have a pipeline problem, there are efforts at the state level  —   led by the Republican State Leadership Committee  —   to recruit, train and support more GOP leaders. But pipelines take a while to fill, and thanks to a new Republican administration, Republicans are losing female leaders faster than they can replace them."

","         NEW YORK      Donald Trump is expected to name a top Goldman Sachs executive, Gary Cohn, to lead the National Economic Council, handing the Wall Street veteran significant sway over his administration’s economic policy. The council includes the heads of various departments and agencies and works within the administration to coordinate economic policy. As director, Cohn would be in position to advise Trump as he attempts to fulfill some of his chief campaign promises, including lowering corporate taxes and rethinking U. S. trade policy. Trump intends to formally name Cohn to the post, which does not require Senate confirmation, but additional details remained unclear, according to a transition official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity and was not authorized to speak publicly. The expected appointment was first reported by NBC News. In Cohn, Trump would once again be picking a veteran of a New York investment bank that he repeatedly denounced during the campaign. During the campaign Trump argued that Goldman held “total control” over both Democrat Hillary Clinton and GOP rival Ted Cruz and he even released a television ad that flashed an image of Goldman Sachs Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein and warned of a “global power structure” that was robbing American workers. But Trump has relied on several Goldman alums for key positions, so far. Steven Mnuchin, a   veteran of the bank, is nominated to be the next Treasury secretary, and Steve Bannon, Trump’s chief strategist, worked on mergers and acquisition deals for Goldman Sachs. Hedge fund manger Anthony Scaramucci began his career at the New York bank and has emerged as one of Trump’s closest advisers on his presidential transition.  Cohn met with the Trump and Vice   Mike Pence at Trump Tower at the end of November, and he would be, by far, the   Goldman Sachs executive slated to serve in the Trump administration. Cohn, president and chief operating officer of the bank, was widely viewed as heir apparent at Goldman Sachs, poised to become CEO when Blankfein retired. He has been at the bank since 1990. As director of the NEC, Cohn would become Trump’s chief economic policy adviser. President Clinton established the National Economic Council in the early 1990s, elevating its first director, Robert Rubin    also a former Goldman banker    into an influential adviser responsible for overseeing the creation of policies to address the administration’s core economic pledges of job growth and deficit reduction. The post has wielded significant power ever since, with Clinton’s Treasury secretary Lawrence Summers serving in the job under President Obama. Currently, Jeff Zients, formerly head of the Office of Management and Budget, holds the position. ”The NEC director is supposed to ensure there is a serious process for the president to make decisions after hearing the competing views of all relevant economic cabinet members in a fair and coordinated way    as opposed to governing based on ad hoc information or who was the last person to whisper in their ear,” said Gene Sperling, who served in the role under both Clinton and Obama. “There is no question Trump would benefit from empowering that type of deliberative   process in his White House.” For more than 20 years, Cohn has run several Goldman Sachs’ businesses, including bond and commodities trading. Cohn built a reputation for a “no holds barred” approach at the bank, said Mike Mayo, a banking analyst with CLSA. “He tells it like how he sees it and should hold his own with blue collar and white collar people alike. ”  In news inteviews, Cohn has struck a moderate tone on controversial issues such as corporate tax inversion and deregulation. At a conference sponsored by the New York Times last year, he argued for keeping U. S. businesses onshore by creating a “really competitive environment. ” He also appeared to take a softer stance on Trump’s campaign promises to roll back the sweeping financial reforms known as the   Act that were instituted under Obama and reinstate a   law that separated commercial and investment banking. ”I do think that part of the regulation we’ve gone through has inhibited our ability to transmit that capital,” Cohn told CNBC last month. “On the other hand, remember U. S. banks today are the strongest banks in the world. ... that’s a huge competitive advantage for U. S. banks and I don’t want to lose that.” Cohn has been a major donor to both parties, according to records from OpenSecrets. org. He supported Florida Sen. Marco Rubio during his presidential bid and he contributed $33, 400 last year to the National Republican Congressional Committee. During the 2008 election cycle, he donated $55, 500 to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign committee and supported the campaigns of both President Obama and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Cohn’s struggle with dyslexia was featured in Malcolm Gladwell’s  ”David And Goliath.” Teachers and classmates wrote him off as an ”idiot,” Cohn told Gladwell, but he managed to make his way through high school and college. After graduation, he took a job selling window frames and aluminum siding for U. S. Steel. But, Cohn has said, he had a passion for financial markets. During an impromptu visit to New York, Cohn followed a man exiting the commodities exchange center at Four World Trade Center onto an elevator. He then offered to share a cab to LaGuardia Airport with the banker. By the end of the car ride, Cohn had the man’s number and weeks after that a job on Wall Street. ”The one trait in a lot of dyslexic people I know is that by the time we got out of college, our ability to deal with failure was very highly developed,” Cohn told Gladwell. ”And so we look at most situations and see much more of the upside than the downside. It doesn’t faze us. I’ve thought about it many times, I really have, because it defined who I am. I wouldn’t be where I am today without my dyslexia. I never would have taken that first chance.”"

","     Winter’s first polar vortex blast, already taking shape in the Arctic this weekend, targets the Lower 48 next week. By Tuesday, temperatures below zero will plunge south into the northern plains and Midwest. Over the course of a few days, the cold air will blast across the country to the Northeast. The northern tier has already seen a taste of what this winter has to offer  —   in fact, the region is already experiencing a significant cold snap. On Thursday morning, the temperature in Billings, Mont. dropped to  . It was the first time the location saw a temperature below zero in 698 days, since Jan. 9, 2015.

Daytime temperatures from Washington to Boston will struggle to climb above freezing. Overnight lows will surely be in the single digits and teens, if not below zero in parts of New England. Through Thursday, 75 percent of the Lower 48 will have experienced a temperature below freezing, including Texas, the Deep South and the Pacific Northwest, based on National Weather Service forecasts. The frigid air tied up in this polar vortex blast has its origins in Siberia and northern Canada. It will be the coldest air of the season so far for most of the United States. Future cold blasts may be more potent, but we haven’t experienced this since last February.    You can trace next week’s cold air outbreak back to the Arctic. (weatherbell. )  The polar vortex is not a new thing  —   it’s a weather term that was popularized in 2014, though it’s always been something meteorologists knew of and referred to among themselves. It’s a very large, extremely cold air mass over the Arctic (the Antarctic has one, too). The concentrated area of cold air is bound by the jet stream, which is a current of   air at very high levels of the atmosphere. When the jet stream is strong and keeps the polar vortex area bottled up north, temperatures can fall to   degrees.     The vortex is always present  —   even in the summer. But winter is when it really comes alive  —   not only is Arctic air colder because of the lack of sunlight, this is also when the jet stream plunges south. When that happens, it allows the cold air to spill south, like a freezer with the door left open. Some of the most historic   outbreaks of the past 30 years have been caused by the polar vortex diving south.      Heavy snow, whiteout conditions, and frigid temperatures are hammering parts of the U. S. and forecasters predict that conditions will get worse next week. (Reuters)   "

","   UNNATURAL CAUSES | SICK AND DYING IN   AMERICA:  Since the turn of this century, death rates have risen for whites in midlife, particularly women. In this series, The Washington Post is exploring this trend and the forces driving it.             of Americans who have taken prescription opioids for at least two months say they became addicted to, or physically dependent on, the powerful painkillers, according to a new Washington   Family Foundation survey.  Virtually all   users surveyed said that they were introduced to the drugs by a doctor’s prescription, not by friends or through illicit means. But more than 6 in 10 said doctors offered no advice on how or when to stop taking the drugs. And 1 in 5 said doctors provided insufficient information about the risk of side effects, including addiction. The survey raises sharp questions about the responsibility of doctors for an epidemic of addiction and overdose that has claimed nearly 180, 000 lives since 2000. Opioid deaths surged to more than 30, 000 last year, according to new data from the U. S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, with deaths from heroin alone surpassing the toll from gun homicides.   Doctors have been widely blamed for sparking the crisis by overprescribing highly addictive opioids to treat everyday pain. The survey suggests that they are still doing too little to stop it. “Why isn’t it 100 percent?” demanded Gary Mendell, founder of Shatterproof, a   group dedicated to reducing addiction in the United States, referring to the share who say doctors have counseled them on stopping the medication. “It’s unbelievable that it’s not 100 percent. ”    Patrice A. Harris, chairwoman of the American Medical Association’s Board of Trustees and chair of its task force to reduce opioid abuse, acknowledged that doctors could do more to counsel patients on avoiding addiction. “The doctors that I have talked to are discussing this with their patients,” Harris said. But, citing the survey, she added: “We could certainly do a better job. ” Despite the high rate of dependence, the poll finds that a majority of   opioid users say the drugs have dramatically improved their lives. Opioids relieve pain that is otherwise in trac table, they said in   interviews, allowing them to walk, work and pursue other activities. Fully   of users surveyed said relief is well worth the risk of addiction.  People living with opioid users tend to have a darker view of the drugs’ effects. While   of users say they are hooked, more than half of people living with them suspect addiction, the survey found. Family members are also far more likely to say the drugs have damaged the users’ physical and mental health, finances and personal relationships.        White women living in   areas have seen a stark increase in death rates  as much as 40 percent in some age groups. View Graphic     White women living in   areas have seen a stark increase in death rates  as much as 40 percent in some age groups.  Still, the survey’s findings highlight a fundamental conflict: While the drugs are a scourge for many, they are a godsend to others, especially the estimated 100 million Americans who live in chronic pain. Efforts by policymakers to restrict use have been met with outrage.  “We’re not saying that no one should ever be on these pills,” but most people would be “healthier and more functional if they were off them,” said CDC Director Tom Frieden, who this spring urged doctors to sharply limit the number of pills they prescribe.  “The bottom line here is that prescription opiates are as addictive as heroin. They’re dangerous drugs,” Frieden said. “You take a few pills, you can be addicted for life. You take a few too many and you can die. ” Opioid abuse  —   both prescription painkillers and their chemical cousins, heroin and fentanyl  —   is the main cause of rising death rates among   white Americans, particularly women in rural areas. It also has contributed to the first overall decline in U. S. life expectancy at birth in more than two decades, the government reported Thursday.   In 2014, U. S. doctors wrote 240 million prescriptions for opiates, enough for every adult to have their own bottle of pills. The CDC estimated that about 2. 1 million Americans are addicted to legal narcotics.   In the   guidelines on opioids for physicians, the CDC in March urged doctors to try nonnarcotic methods before offering patients pills containing oxycodone, hydrocodone and other opioids. The guidelines noted that there is little evidence that opioids are effective beyond 12 weeks.  “Three days or less will often be sufficient; more than seven days will rarely be needed,” the guidelines say. But many people take the drugs much longer. In the past two years, about 5 percent of American adults have used prescription opioids for at least two months, the poll found; about half of those report taking the drugs for two years or more.     For the survey, one of the most comprehensive polls of   opioid users to date, The Post and Kaiser interviewed 622 people who said that they had taken narcotic painkillers for at least two months over the past two years. The survey also included 187 people who said they share a household with an opioid user, usually a spouse or a parent. The survey did not include people who were treated for cancer or a terminal illness. At the time of the interview, 45 percent of   users were no longer taking the drugs, while 55 percent were still taking them. Users were slightly more likely than the general public to be white and far more apt to be  . Nearly all   users (95 percent) said that they began taking the drugs to relieve pain from surgery, an injury or a chronic condition. Just 3 percent said that they started as recreational users. More than 8 in 10 said that they tried to manage their pain with nonnarcotic medication; about 7 in 10 said that they tried alternative treatments, such as physical therapy and acupuncture. More than half (57 percent) found those methods ineffective.     Charles Stonesifer, 74, a former bricklayer who lives in Baltimore, has taken Tylenol with codeine and then Tramadol over the past two years. “Both my knees are shot,” he said, adding that he would be unable to walk without narcotics. Stonesifer said that he had no trouble giving up the drugs when he tried, but his pain returned and he was forced to resume taking them. “If they actually stopped you from getting the [drugs] it would be very difficult for me,” Stonesifer said. “It would put me in a wheelchair instead of being able to get around. And once you’re in a wheelchair, you never get up. ”  Nancy Horton, 62, of Martinsburg, W. Va. admits that she is addicted to the 190 milligrams of oxycodone she takes daily to dull the pain of rheumatoid arthritis. Without the drugs, “I get the shakes. I am very anxious,” she said. “I just pace constantly. I can’t get comfortable. ”  After 15 years on opioids, she said, “I look back now and think, ‘What could I have done differently?’ ”  Sizable minorities of respondents report using the drugs for purposes other than managing pain. Such behavior is much more common among people who say they are addicted or physically dependent on opioids. Among this group, 47 percent say they sometimes take the drugs for “fun or to get high”; 38 percent use them to “deal with    stress”; and 30 percent use them to “relax or relieve tension. ” Side effects are widespread. Over half of   users said that they have experienced constipation; almost as many felt indigestion, dry mouth or nausea; and 15 percent said that they have had breathing problems. One in 5 (21 percent) have taken additional medications to treat those symptoms.  More than half (52 percent) of   users said that they have taken other prescription medications for anxiety, depression and sleeplessness while on opioids, and 1 in 6 said that they have consumed the drugs along with alcohol  —   risky combinations that could have dire consequences. Overall, nearly 6 in 10 said that they take at least four prescription drugs, and about   said that they take seven or more medications.    The survey revealed a largely positive relationship between opioid consumers and their doctors. Large majorities said doctors have warned them to avoid alcohol, cautioned them about possible side effects and explained the risk of addiction.  But 61 percent said that their doctors did not suggest a plan for getting off the drugs when they were first prescribed, and more than half said doctors have not altered their dose or frequency. Among   users who stopped taking opioids, 34 percent said the termination of their prescription was a reason. Just 4 percent said that they have a prescription for naloxone, the drug that can be administered by someone else in an emergency to reverse the effect of an overdose.    While about a quarter of   users said a friend or family member has suggested they stop taking the drug,   said that they are “not too” or “not at all” concerned about becoming addicted. And about 6 in 10 of those who report being addicted have not sought treatment or other help. Yngvild Olsen, chair of the American Society of Addiction Medicine’s public policy committee, said doctors “have a vital role to play in addressing the epidemic, not only by changing their prescribing patterns and learning a lot about more about chronic pain management and addiction, but also by stepping up to the plate in learning how to treat addiction. ”   Emily Guskin, Monica Akhtar and Erin Patrick O’Connor contributed to this report.

","     If there is one thing that I learned from Pizzagate, it is that we are working much, much too hard to find conspiracies. The origin of this conspiracy theory (which now, like any good conspiracy theory, includes   and secret tunnels) seems to be that someone decided that the word “pizza” in an email from those leaked from John Podesta by WikiLeaks could not POSSIBLY mean “pizza” and leaped immediately from there to the conclusion that it meant child (or child pornography; even the conspiracy is not quite clear on this point) and from that concluded that the Comet Ping Pong restaurant was the hub of a secret pedophile ring catering to Hillary Clinton. This theory, subsequently bolstered by pictures taken out of context from Comet social media, music videos and intense misreadings of innocuous symbols, would have been merely absurd if a human being had not shown up at the restaurant with a gun in an effort to free the nonexistent children being held there in nonexistent secret tunnels. No one was hurt, thank goodness, but can we stop jumping from zero to New World Order Child Sex Trafficking? There are plenty of obvious conspiracies RIGHT BEFORE OUR EYES that we need to merely wake up and see. American history: “How does a ragtag volunteer army in need of a shower somehow defeat a global superpower?” Exactly. George Washington and George III having the same name cannot be a coincidence either. George Washington was a Mason. Just listing these unrelated facts in order should be sufficient proof. There is no way that we defeated the British, which is why, at the “surrender” at “Yorktown” (bad name for a place; sounds fabricated) they played “The World Turned Upside Down. ” Clearly, this was code. Why didn’t George Washington have any children of his own? He only had one real tooth. He wore a stranger’s teeth. This is all connected. “Hamilton”: Has anyone actually seen this musical? The only pictures of it ever seen are clearly staged for inclusion in newspaper reviews. When people “go” to “see” it, they take pictures of the stage door and of the program, but never actually the show. This is a concept album and a popular delusion, bolstered by a sinister theater syndicate and vague Tumblr presences. There is no way anyone would spend this much money to see Thomas Jefferson rap. Floss: Is there actually floss in a container of floss? When dentists give you free ones, they have at least six inches of floss within, but can anyone confirm that there is more? Has anyone ever finished one of these containers? Has anyone ever actually flossed? If so, why is there no record of it? What did it achieve, if anything? Giraffes: Clearly made up. Just look at them. They are construction cranes covered in   coats with a child’s drawing of a horse face tacked on to avert suspicion. These are not real animals, and the sooner we stop pretending that they are, the better. Metro: This elaborate maze of underground tunnels that are often full of mysterious carts that start nowhere and go nowhere cannot possibly be meant to transport people to and from their places of work. Sometimes it is full of mysterious fire, water and deadly smoke (clearly Masonic symbolism). On H Street NE, for many months, a trolley went back and forth, mournfully dinging, with no passengers inside. This cannot be a real organization run in a businesslike manner. Must be a coverup of some kind. Opossums: I hear about these, but I have never seen them. Electoral college: You mean to tell me that when we went to the polls and voted for a candidate for president, we did not actually vote for this person, but for an “elector” who will go and cast a vote in a predetermined ratio, state by state, and is also free to change his or her mind at any time? This is completely absurd. A person can win the popular vote by a margin of 2 million people and yet the lose presidency? Conspiracy. Science: All of science is a conspiracy. This is especially true of any branch of science that tells me I should not do something I want to do, such as climate science or nutrition. School: If “school” is so “vital” to “success,” why is nothing they teach there related in any way to your subsequent life or work? People need to understand budgets. This is never taught, but algebra is. Is algebra real? Is calculus? I have never used a conic section, ever. Students are forced to complete so many equations that they cease to question. This is a series of pointless   intended to keep America’s youth down. Why won’t they let you use cellphones during class? What are they trying to keep us from seeing? Calendars: Mysterious 29th day of February appears, then disappears, at seemingly regular intervals. Daylight saving time: Suddenly, each fall, sinister global corporations change the time on all our phones in order to force us to remain indoors working until it is dark. Then, in the spring, they allow us to wake up after it is already light. Something must be out and active in the twilight periods of the spring and fall, and They don’t want us to see Whatever It Is. Must investigate further. Christmas: This holiday bears NO resemblance to the event it ostensibly celebrates  —   namely, the birth, more than 2, 000 years ago, of Jesus Christ. Fir trees, mistletoe,   are all clearly pagan rituals or holdovers from the fest of Saturnalia. No logical connection. Doesn’t make sense. Easter is similar but worse. Conspiracy theories: Why are the best minds of our time wasted running up and down M. C.       of their own construction? Why, after they devote decades to establishing what appear to them to be incontrovertible mountains of proof, do they scribble them on a series of cocktail napkins instead of typing them in a coherent manner, with spaces between paragraphs in a decent font and with citations, and sending them to a newspaper or TV station? Why, when they opt to publish online, have all the good website names been taken, leaving only strings of at least four decreasingly convincing words, like SecretMindConspiracyTimes. Net or RealTruthHumanRadio. mindspring? Vast waste of brainpower. There must be sinister forces at work."

","   Michael Kinsley is a columnist for Vanity Fair magazine and a contributing columnist for The Post.       Donald Trump is a fascist. When you call somebody a fascist, you can mean any number of things. Often, it means no more than “somebody I don’t like. ” It is an   epithet, usable by anyone against everyone from university deans to Fox News anchors. For that reason, the label should be used sparingly  —   saved for special occasions. As with “Nazi” or “Hitler,” it is often said that in any discussion, the first person reduced to using such a word has lost the argument. It’s ridiculous to compare any living person to Hitler or Mussolini.  But I mean “fascist” in the more clinical sense. For close to a year, and especially since his election as president, people have been trying to figure out Trump’s political principles: What does he stand for, how will he act as president? Various theories have been advanced. Some think he won the election by pandering simultaneously to different groups with conflicting agendas, and convincing all of them he was on their side. Was this a calculated exploitation of America’s “gimme gimme gimme” politics? Or was it the politics of a man who had no politics, who wanted to be president because, in our celebrity culture, it was the only job more glamorous than starring in his own reality television show? It has even been suggested, in the sole subject of conversation in Washington for the past month, that Trump might allow himself to be sworn in as president and then resign, having accomplished all he aspired to. But now that we’ve seen a bit of him in action, it seems that Trump actually does have a recognizable agenda that explains how he simultaneously can pander to big business generally while “ ” (the words of a Post editorial Friday) an air conditioning manufacturer to save a few hundred jobs for a while. Or how he can make nice with the authoritarian Vladimir Putin while making bellicose foreign policy noises in general. Or how he can blithely upset with a phone call the absurdly delicate balance of our relations with China and Taiwan. All this seemingly erratic behavior can be explained  —   if not justified  —   by thinking of Trump as a fascist. Not in the sense of an   bad guy, but in the sense of somebody who sincerely believes that the toxic combination of strong government and strong corporations should run the nation and the world. He spent his previous career negotiating with the government on behalf of corporations; now he has switched teams. But it’s the same game. The game has several names: “Corporate statism” is one. In Europe, they call it “dirigisme. ” Those two other words for it  —   “Nazism” and “fascism”  —   are now beyond all respectability. It means, roughly, combining the power of the state with the power of corporations. At its mildest, it is intrusive regulations on business about parental leave and such. At its most toxic, it is concentration camps. In the 1930s, a few Americans (including a few liberals) bought into it. Pearl Harbor ended that argument. Even for Trump, “fascism” itself now is a dirty word, not just a policy choice. Even Trump would not use it  —   least of all about himself. But the deal Trump negotiated with Carrier and its parent company, United Technologies, to “save” hundreds of jobs is a prime example of the philosophy. Trump brags about “saving” Midwestern   jobs through a combination of bribery and  . Turns out hundreds more jobs will be lost, and Trump as president can’t possibly negotiate on behalf of millions of workers. But Trump believes  —   truly believes, I think  —   in the title of one of his books: the art of the deal. He thinks he is the world’s greatest negotiator. When he says he won’t reveal his income taxes because he is in the midst of negotiations with the IRS, he may be sincere. He says, believably, that he gets audited every year. That means every year’s tax bill is just the government’s opening move in an annual chess game, and Trump doesn’t want to give away his own opening move. Now he plans to negotiate more “deals” and he thinks  —   because he can outfox some midlevel IRS auditors  —   that he can outfox the political and business leaders of the world. “The Art of the Deal” is not “Mein Kampf,” although “not ‘Mein Kampf’ ” isn’t much of an endorsement. Just to be clear: If I’m correct that Trump actually has a governing philosophy, that’s a bad thing, not a good thing. If he actually has principles to guide him through those famous swamps he plans to drain, that’s alarming, not reassuring. Bad principles are not a good substitute for no principles. Four or eight years of bad principles may make no principles look pretty good.   Read more:   John McNeill: How fascist is Donald Trump? There’s actually a formula for that.

142159,217541,What we hope Paul Ryan told Trump,Washington Post,Jennifer Rubin,2016-12-09,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161210000446/https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2016/12/09/what-we-hope-paul-ryan-told-trump/
","         House Speaker Paul Ryan ( .) reportedly met with   Donald Trump today about his top agenda items, namely “dismantling Obamacare, securing the border and   the economy. ” If Ryan wanted to do the   Congress and the country a favor, here is what we hope he said about Obamacare: Mr.   we all ran on getting rid of it  —   in fact, getting rid of all of it. But 20 million or so people are on it. You promised something “terrific” instead, so what is it? You don’t have anything specific in mind, you say? Well, then let’s do exactly what we said  —   repeal and replace Obamacare. I’ve had this plan for years and put it in my “A Better Way” agenda. We should in one fell swoop repeal Obamacare and pass the House plan, with a   date a couple years out. In 2018, our members can run on it, and you will have fulfilled your promise. Democrats? Oh, they’ll probably hate it. If the House passes something, there will be a huge fight in the Senate. But that’s where you come in. You’re the   right? So make a deal, and if the Democrats won’t budge, we run in 2018, especially against the   Democrats, on their refusal to give voters a better   plan. Oh, and we’ll probably have to bail out insurers to keep them in the plan in the meantime, or else modify existing Obamacare rules so that they can make some profit. And whatever we come up with is going to cost a lot. Alas, Ryan is pushing a “repeal and dawdle” arrangement that leaves the replacement up in the air and Republicans politically vulnerable in 2018. Maybe Trump talked some sense to Ryan. (We can’t believe we actually wrote that sentence, but that’s 2016 for you.) On border security, we hope Ryan leveled with Trump: We won already! More people are leaving than coming into the country along the Mexican border. The wall would be really expensive, so maybe spend some more to get more surveillance on the border (Isn’t that what drones can do?) and some more border agents. But honestly, the problem sort of solved itself. Let’s redo the visa system so that we can flag people who overstay. Yup, that’s about it. Oh, the murderers running around loose on the streets? The Obama people have already made criminals the priority. There are really a small number of criminals who were not incarcerated or deported. A lot of those are nonviolent drug offenders. The best thing we could do is clear out the huge backlog in the immigration courts so that we can process cases quickly. Now here’s an idea: You want “the” Hispanics to love you? Say up front that no “dreamer” who came forward and passed the background check is going to be deported. When we get around to creating a path for legalization  —   yeah, Ann Coulter and Jeff Sessions are really going to freak  —   we can put them on it. But you sure don’t want pictures of dedicated college kids and soldiers brought here as babies getting shipped back to Mexico. Democrats will be flabbergasted.  Finally, on the economy, we hope Ryan gave Trump an Economics 101 lesson. Beyond that, he could have broken some more news: About China, Mr.   it hasn’t manipulated its currency in a long time, and the Chinese aren’t “killing us,” as you like to say. We get cheap stuff from them; they get pieces of paper (cash) and then turn around to finance our debt or otherwise invest in the United States. The trade deficit doesn’t have much to do with employment, by the way. And good news  —   unemployment is around 4. 6 percent! What could we do to give the economy a nudge? Well, we do need infrastructure repairs and projects, but we’d better make sure we don’t just give rich developers, no disrespect intended, tax breaks or fund a bunch of nonsense projects. Make the governors list two or three top priorities, and we work from that list. Yeah, our schools aren’t doing the job, and we’ve got to really get our workforce up to speed. Hey, if you want to   people, why not call up chief executives of the Fortune 500 companies and tell them they’d better start sponsoring STEM education, setting up apprenticeship and training programs and putting some of that money repatriated from overseas (from our tax plan) into better wages and benefits. Make them all do it and then make a fuss each time someone agrees to sign on to your plan. It would make great TV. The chances of this sort of straight talk having occurred are small, we know. But if Ryan was feeling   he also could have told Trump  : You have to sell the businesses, or nothing you want to do is going to get done. Now that would have been something  —   Ryan standing up for the Constitution and for clean government.  "

Weintraub,2016-12-09,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161210000446/https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/i-worked-with-trumps-pick-for-white-house-counsel-he-doesnt-care-about-corruption/2016/12/09/76f0793c-bcac-11e6-94ac-3d324840106c_story.html
","   Ellen L. Weintraub is a member of the Federal Election Commission.     The White House counsel operates out of the public eye but has the president’s ear. In the Trump administration, with the unprecedented multiplicity of    challenges facing the   the job will take on added importance. As a Democratic commissioner at the Federal Election Commission, I served five years alongside Donald F. McGahn,   Donald Trump’s choice for the post. My experience may be instructive  —   and disquieting.  The FEC’s fundamental mission is to fight corruption by shining a light on money in politics, empowering citizens to assess their elected officials’ potential conflicts of interest. From the moment he walked in the door in 2008, McGahn made no secret of his disdain for the agency, its mission and the commission staff. At the   FEC, McGahn corralled his two fellow Republicans into a rigid voting bloc, promoting gridlock and delay. In decision after decision, he ensured that the money flooding our political system grew ever murkier and the connections between donors and candidates harder to trace.    Donald F. McGahn in Trump Tower in New York on Nov. 15. (Drew   Images)   Appointed to be an arbiter of   complaints, McGahn instead assumed the mantle of defense counsel, making an art form of devising byzantine arguments against investigating alleged wrongdoing. Should we investigate groups that spend  millions on political ads without disclosing a single donor? Not as he saw it. When a wealthy donor chartered a plane to bring hundreds of volunteers to a candidate’s fundraising event, could that possibly have been an   contribution to the candidate? Again, no. When making its decisions, must the commission blind itself to public information known by any reader of The Post? Amazingly, according to McGahn, yes. Agency dysfunction was not a byproduct of McGahn’s approach  —   it was the goal. In the wake of the Supreme Court’s 2010 Citizens United decision, McGahn vetoed proposed rules aimed at ensuring disclosure of the sources of political spending, barring employees from being coerced to support their bosses’ political choices, keeping foreign interests from influencing our elections and addressing the new political powerhouses known as super PACs. I have served on the FEC for 14 years, with 14 commissioners. While disagreements are nothing new at the FEC, commissioners on both sides of the aisle used to understand that serving on a commission comprised of three Democratic and three Republican appointees required compromise and that it was our job to make the agency work. No other commissioner has been as intransigent, as hostile to other points of view and as determined to undermine the law and the commission as McGahn was. The example he set hampers the agency to this day. Was McGahn motivated by libertarian fervor or by the sense that his partisans would take more aggressive advantage of the   zone he worked to create? I don’t pretend to have a window into his motives. But the results are inarguable: During the five fiscal years before McGahn arrived ( ) the commission negotiated more than $16 million in civil penalties in major cases. Even as the cost of campaigns skyrocketed over the next five years, from 2009 to 2013, McGahn’s relentless obstruction caused penalties to plummet 79 percent, to just $3. 3 million. By his final year, we could muster the votes to launch only four investigations. The White House counsel interprets a great many    issues, and here again McGahn’s tenure at the FEC gives pause. It is the role of commissioners to enforce laws adopted by Congress, unless and until they are struck down by the courts. But McGahn substituted his own view of the Constitution. As he once boasted, “I’m not enforcing the law as Congress passed it. I plead guilty as charged. ” And it’s not just Congress McGahn ignored. Even though the Supreme Court resoundingly endorsed the benefits of disclosure in Citizens United, McGahn blocked all attempts to rein in unreported   spending.      The Post’s Matea Gold looks at how   Donald Trump’s campaign pledge to “drain the swamp” of special interests and big donors compares with his Cabinet picks so far. (Bastien   Washington Post)    How will McGahn view his new role? Service as White House counsel is not a quest to unearth clever legal loopholes. It requires viewing public office as a public trust, where officeholders aspire to the highest ethical standards, regardless of what they think they might get away with. With Congress unlikely to exercise robust oversight, it falls all the more to the White House counsel to ensure that the administration acts ethically and honorably.  The early signs are not promising. The   has already asserted that “the president can’t have a conflict of interest. ” His inaugural team is peddling special access for   donors.  During his campaign, the   characterized our political system as corrupt and vowed to “drain the swamp. ” The last time McGahn’s job was to regulate corruption, he instead gleefully paralyzed the agency charged with enforcing the law.  So what are the odds that a White House counseled by him will take any credible steps to drain the ethical swamp? My experience with McGahn does not offer much basis for optimism.

142161,217543,How Schumer and the Democrats are preparing to fight,Washington Post,Dana Milbank,2016-12-09,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161210000446/https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/schumer-and-the-democrats-craft-their-attack-plan/2016/12/09/f02c42f8-be1a-11e6-94ac-3d324840106c_story.html
"," As of Jan. 20, Chuck Schumer will be the most important Democrat in the land. But spend a few minutes with the incoming Senate minority leader and it’s clear where the real power lies. I was interviewing the New York Democrat in his Capitol hideaway office this week when he paused to take a call on his archaic flip phone. It was about an event scheduled for the next day to highlight a new initiative tallying jobs “outsourced” overseas during the Trump presidency.  Schumer had one question: “Is Bernie coming?” “He told me he’d come,” Schumer continued. “Hold on, I’ll call him right now. ” The party leader had his aides track down Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, the populist insurgent who nearly beat Hillary Clinton in the Democratic primaries. “Hey, Bernie, so can you come?” Schumer asked. “We’ll do it at a time that’s good for you, okay? . . . Try to clear it. It’s a good event. . . . It’s right up your alley and you can help us by coming. . . . It complements what you’re doing. . . . We need you. ” Schumer hung up. “Okay, he’ll come. ”     Speaking Dec. 2. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (Calif.) said Republicans are ”more interested in dismantling Medicare than building job creating infrastructure,” after   Donald Trump chose Rep. Tom Price ( .) to lead the Department of Health and Human Services. (Reuters)   Sanders didn’t come.  But the interruption said much about how Schumer will lead Democrats in the age of Donald Trump. Schumer, though close to Wall Street for much of his career, is wholeheartedly embracing the party’s   Warren populism. This means Schumer, and the Democrats, are ready to fight. Conventional wisdom says Schumer will be pulled in a moderate and conciliatory posture by the 10 Senate Democrats up for reelection in 2018 in states that Trump won (two of them, West Virginia’s Joe Manchin III and North Dakota’s Heidi Heitkamp, have been wooed by Trump as possible Cabinet secretaries). He’ll be pulled the other way by Warren and Sanders, who represent the party’s energy.  But Schumer correctly views this as a false choice. The best way to protect endangered incumbents is to let the Warren wing lead. Schumer’s predecessor, outgoing Democratic leader Harry Reid (Nev.) did his best both in the majority and the minority to protect vulnerable incumbents such as Mary Landrieu (Louisiana) and Mark Begich (Alaska) using parliamentary tactics to avoid tough votes. But a byproduct of this was that Democrats didn’t articulate a clear agenda  —   and Landrieu and Begich lost anyway. If Democrats are to have any hope in 2018, they’ll need to reclaim the populism Trump stole in 2016. Schumer embraces this. “If you want to appeal to the manufacturing worker in Scranton, the college student in Los Angeles and the single mom making minimum wage in Harlem, one economic message will work,” he said. “We just didn’t have it” in 2016. Schumer pledges to keep his focus almost entirely on the economy. When Republicans hold votes on energy and social issues that divide Democrats, he figures he’ll have enough votes to filibuster even if endangered incumbents split off. “We’re going to have five, six   [policies] that can be described in five words,” Schumer said. “That economic message”  —   college affordability, infrastructure spending, taxing the rich  —   “unites our caucus. ” This reflects a broader   debate among Democrats. Clinton ally David Brock this week blamed the loss on the party, saying it “faces a crisis of competence at all levels” and calling for a commission to investigate. Nonsense, reply those in the Warren wing. They say Clinton’s economic agenda was a muddled,    theme when people wanted change. They say Trump got to Democrats’ left with working people, and the answer now is to unite behind specific legislation such as expanding Social Security and protecting Medicare from privatization, and raising taxes on the wealthy to pay for infrastructure spending. This has unified Democrats before. Manchin teamed up in 2015 with Warren on legislation expanding Social Security, and Begich and Landrieu joined her 2013 effort to reduce student loan rates by taxing millionaires. If the new president comes Democrats’ way, things will get done. If he takes a traditional Republican approach to the economy  —   stocking his Cabinet with billionaires and Wall Street multimillionaires suggests this is what he’ll do  —   Democrats will fight, and Trump’s   backers will know they were had. This doesn’t mean a Mitch   effort to oppose Trump reflexively  —   something Schumer told Trump when the   called him recently to discuss infrastructure. “I said to him it’s got to be robust, it can’t be just tax credits because nothing much will get built . . . and it can’t cut traditional programs” such as education and Medicare. “He didn’t argue with me,” Schumer recounted. Conversely, when Trump contradicts his campaign themes  —   a Wall Street banker as treasury secretary, a billionaire   devotee as education secretary and a health and human services secretary who wants to privatize Medicare  —   he can expect a populist pushback from Democrats. This, and not incumbent protection, is what will work for Democrats in 2018 and beyond.

142162,217544,A man who rejects settled science on climate change should not lead the EPA,Washington Post,Editorial Board,2016-12-09,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161210000446/https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/a-man-who-rejects-settled-science-on-climate-change-should-not-lead-the-epa/2016/12/09/fdf7b422-bd83-11e6-94ac-3d324840106c_story.html
"," THE WEEK started with a hopeful sign for those concerned about climate change: Former vice president Al Gore met with Donald Trump for about 90 minutes on Monday, leading some to believe that the   might be ready to accept facts and evidence. By the end of the week, however, Mr. Trump had selected Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt (R) to lead the Environmental Protection Agency.  Mr. Pruitt wrote this in National Review in May: “Global warming has inspired one of the major policy debates of our time. That debate is far from settled. Scientists continue to disagree about the degree and extent of global warming and its connection to the actions of mankind. That debate should be encouraged  —   in classrooms, public forums, and the halls of Congress. It should not be silenced with threats of prosecution. Dissent is not a crime. ” Dissent, indeed, is not a crime, and acknowledging the uncertainties in climate forecasts is reasonable. But rejecting or playing down the   warnings of experts, which are based on decades of substantial and continually accumulating evidence and suggest vast implications for future generations, should disqualify a nominee from leading an expert agency charged with making   decisions. Among scientists there is virtually no dissent from the conclusion that human activity  —   the burning of fossil fuels, which releases   gases that stay in the atmosphere  —   is leading to planetary warming, and that the coming changes pose severe risks.  No doubt we would disagree with Mr. Pruitt on any number of issues. He is a leading voice against the Clean Power Plan, President Obama’s centerpiece climate policy. Even before his nomination, the New York Times had uncovered extremely close ties between Mr. Pruitt and the oil and gas industry. He has been tapped to run an agency much of whose work he believes should cease. We might not oppose Mr. Pruitt’s nomination based on these differences. There are legitimate arguments, based in states’ rights and concerns over overregulation, against the Obama administration’s assertive application of clean water and clean air laws. A president is entitled to advisers, if they are qualified, who reflect his views. But rejecting settled science strikes us as being in a different category. The Senate should probe Mr. Pruitt’s position on climate change. If he explicitly or implicitly rejects the scientific consensus, that would be justification to vote no. If, on the other hand, he acknowledges the risks facing the globe, lawmakers should ask what Mr. Pruitt would be prepared to do as the nation’s chief environmental officer to combat them.

142163,217545,Red-state Democrats end shutdown threat over coal miners’ health care,Washington Post,Kelsey Snell,2016-12-09,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161210000446/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2016/12/09/red-state-democrats-flirt-with-a-brief-government-shutdown-over-coal-miners-healthcare/
","       Senate Democrats used a standoff over a   spending bill to appeal to the   white voters they lost to   Donald Trump by threatening a short government shutdown over issues important to them. Democrats relented late Friday and agreed to allow a vote on the spending measure hours before government funding was set to expire at midnight. The bill is expected to be cleared for President Obama’s signature before that deadline, avoiding a shutdown. “We’re not going to shut down the government,” said incoming Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer ( . Y.). “We’ve made our point. ”   Democrats up for reelection in 2018 forced the standoff to insist on   benefits for retired coal miners and requiring the use of American steel in infrastructure projects. Democrats said they would continue to press these issues when Congress returns early next year. “If you’re alive today, for most of your life, over 50 percent of your energy has been given to you, has been delivered to you because of coal,” Sen. Joe Manchin III ( . Va.) who led the effort to delay he bill, said on the Senate floor. “We need to bring attention to the people who have done the work. They’re forgotten heroes. In West Virginia we feel like a Vietnam returning veteran. We’ve done everything that our country has asked of you, and now you won’t even recognize us, don’t even understand what we’ve done. ” “That’s what we’re fighting for,” he said. The fight is the first sign of an emerging strategy for Democrats who are looking to force their Republican counterparts to respond to Trump’s campaign promises. Forcing the   fight into the government spending debate allowed Democrats to publicly shame Republicans  —   although it’s unclear where Trump stands on the measure. Schumer told reporters Thursday that the issue could easily unite Democrats and Trump. “I hope our new   who talked and got to know the miners, will speak out,” Schumer said. “We don’t care about partisanship. ” Senate Democrats also wanted funding for the “Buy American” program included in a water resources bill that is slated to come up for a Senate vote after the spending bill is complete. Republicans have been willing to support the provision as part of temporary spending bills but have resisted including it in   legislation such as the water bill. That tension puts Republicans at odds with Trump, who backed the concept at a rally last week. “Whether it’s producing steel, building cars or curing disease, we want the next generation of innovation and production to happen right here in America and right here in Ohio, right?” Trump said in Cincinnati. Senate Democrats wanted Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R) who hails from Kentucky, a big   state, to agree to a   extension of a program to help fund health care for miners. No deal was struck, but McConnell has said he plans to address the issue next year before the benefits expire. Manchin  —   a candidate for energy secretary in Trump’s Cabinet  —   canceled a scheduled Friday meeting with the   to continue negotiations in Washington, but he is expected to visit Trump Tower on Monday. Manchin has been joined in the push by Sens. Heidi Heitkamp ( . D.) Robert P. Casey Jr. ( .) Sherrod Brown ( ) Mark R. Warner ( .) and Claire McCaskill ( . ). All but Warner are up for reelection in states that Trump won. The measure would affect about 23, 000 miners and retired miners who get   coverage from plans that are running out of money. Approximately 60 percent of those retired miners were employed by companies that are no longer in the mining business and therefore don’t have current employees to help support the fund. “We are at stand up or shut up,” Manchin said at a news conference Thursday night. Heitkamp called out Trump by name as she left a Thursday meeting between Senate Minority Leader Harry M. Reid ( .) and several of the Democrats who represent states Trump won. “We think there has been a renewed interest in these kind of issues with   Donald Trump,” said Heitkamp, who recently met with him in New York. “We’re hopeful that we’ll be able to get relief and be able to deliver a Christmas present to some of the most sympathetic working people in America. ” Republicans have taken note of which Democrats led this fight and which bloc of voters this issue would appeal to in the midterm elections two years from now. “You’ve got to look at the people who are doing it, and Senator Brown and Senator Manchin are both up in 2018,” Sen. John Cornyn (Tex.) the No. 2 Republican in the Senate leadership, told reporters Thursday. “Obviously they’d like to show they’re fighting on behalf of their constituents. ” Other Democrats, including Casey and Heitkamp, that have taken lead roles are also up in 2018. Trump won many of their states in last month’s presidential election  —   ranging from the narrowest of margins in Pennsylvania, less than one percentage point above Hillary Clinton, to an overwhelming margin of 42 percentage points in Manchin’s West Virginia. Trump won those states by running up huge margins among white   voters, including many union workers or former union members whose support these Democrats will need to win back to get reelected. In that regard, some Democrats believe their stand trying to help mine workers  —   a symbolic embodiment of the white working class  —   might demonstrate to those voters now that they have not been forgotten by senators facing reelection in 2018. One senator suggested that the Midwestern Democrats initially acted on their own to start this fight in the middle of what is a slightly awkward vacuum at the top of the caucus, with Reid retiring this week amid many gala celebrations and his trusted deputy, Schumer, still being deferential to Reid until he formally leaves office. In recent days, Schumer became more involved in the strategy and worked closely with the Democrats who are up for reelection in 2018  —   many of whom hold special significance to him because they were first elected in 2006 when Schumer was the party’s campaign chief.

142164,217546,"In Germany, the language of Nazism is no longer buried in the past",Washington Post,Anthony Faiola,2016-12-09,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161210000446/https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/in-germany-the-language-of-nazism-is-no-longer-buried-in-the-past/2016/12/09/d70bce74-bc85-11e6-ae79-bec72d34f8c9_story.html
","       BERLIN  —   In a recent tweet, a German lawmaker used a highly specific term to describe her   angst. Suggesting her country’s national identity was under threat, she cried “Umvolkung”  —   a word roughly translated as “ethnic conversion. ”  It is also a word that was last in vogue when Adolf Hitler ruled the land, and its appropriation by a politician from Chancellor Angela Merkel’s ruling party sparked a raucous uproar. Yet the tweet highlighted the term’s resurgence in Germany  —   where a glossary of a   terms long associated with the Nazis are staging a comeback. Hitler and his propagandists wielded a toxic lexicon in the early 20th century, deploying vocabulary meant to exalt ethnic purity and own Germany’s only real truth. And the reemergence in social media, literature and political protests of words that were weaponized by the Nazis is generating a fierce debate here over the power of language in politics, especially as nationalists surge on both sides of the Atlantic.  “While we’re at it, why don’t we just give a positive meaning to the word ‘concentration camp?’ ” quipped television satirist   Heist after a different German politician recently defended another word  —   völkisch  —   used by the Nazis to conjure images of a racially pure state. Forces on the political right are hailing the exhumation of such words as a triumph over political correctness and war guilt  —   as well as a nod to free speech in Europe, which came under the spotlight after the guilty verdict Friday against Dutch nationalist Geert Wilders for inciting hate against Moroccans. Calling it time to reclaim German words tainted by the Nazis, proponents see a new      discourse taking shape over an influx of nearly 1 million   migrants from Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan and beyond. In a   world, some reclaimed words are meant to stake ownership over truth. At least one  —   Lügenpresse, or “lying press,” a slur aimed at the mainstream media  —   popped up among Donald Trump supporters on the U. S. campaign trail. In Germany, it’s become a fixture at   protests and a word lobbed like bombs on Twitter and Facebook against the media.      Critics, however, see heightened usage of ethnically charged terms as an attempt to detoxify them  —   as well as the racist notions they once represented.  As linguistic political tools, experts rank them alongside “ ”  —   coined in the United States to recast the white supremacy movement. Rather than mint new words, however, the Germans need only look to history for a nationalist thesaurus. Critics say those embracing such vocabulary are playing a coy game, winking at German nationalism without openly saluting Hitler.  “If someone said ‘Sieg Heil’ today, it would be clear this is about National Socialism,” said Georg Schuppener, a noted German linguist and language historian. But the words popping up now “at first don’t sound like National Socialism, but nevertheless suggest it. ”  All the words in question predate the Nazis but became tainted in the public   after their deployment in Nazi propaganda. After World War II, some terms lingered in beer hall talk and   circles. During the Cold War, a few found a perch in communist East Germany. But German linguists point to a resuscitation of nationalist terms in 2014, when the   group PEGIDA began staging massive demonstrations nationwide. Two years later, the rapid rise of the populist,   Alternative for Germany (AfD)  —   coupled with massive public skepticism of Merkel’s refu gee policy   —   has these terms rolling off the tongues of politicians and flying around social media in a manner that has shocked many Germans.  In a September interview with Die Welt, the AfD’s chief, Frauke Petry, declared it an “undue simplification” to call the German word “völkisch” fundamentally racist. Though used by Hitler and his lieutenants to describe a racially pure population, she argued that modern Germans should give the term “a positive connotation again. ”  Last month, Stefan Räpple, another AfD lawmaker, described peers from German parties as “Volksverräter”  —   or “traitor of the people. ” Used in the Nazi era as an official charge against enemies, the term has additionally burst forth from the mouths of protesters at   political rallies and protests. In August, for instance,   demonstrators taunted Merkel’s deputy chancellor by calling him “Volksverräter. ”      In a 1933 speech, Hitler’s propaganda minister Joesph Goebbels used the word “Überfremdung” to denounce what the Nazis saw as the infection of German intellectual life by Jews. Following losses in local elections this year, conservative dissenters in Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and its sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU) used it to define citizens’ fears toward the migrant wave. “The concern about a loss of identity and Überfremdung of the country has seized many citizens,” they wrote in a manifesto.   Previously known for his   novels about cats solving crimes, the writer Akif Pirinçci published a tome this year titled “Umvolkung  —   How the Germans are quietly being replaced. ” Though Turkish born, Pirinçci has now aligned himself squarely with German nationalists. His book assailed Merkel’s   policy toward asylum seekers from the Middle East and beyond, warning that Germans were becoming “strangers in our own country. ” Ronald Gläser, a   politician for the AfD, called it unfair to draw any parallels between those redeploying such words now and their use in Nazi propaganda. “None of us deliberately use National Socialist vocabulary,” he bluntly said. Attempting to explain the increasing popularity of such words, he added, that many Germans simply “fear that by 2040, Germany will be like a Third World country which doesn’t consist mostly of white people. ”      Yet in a nation highly sensitive to any echoes of the Nazis  —   and where the nationalists have had a harder time gaining a foothold than in many other European nations  —   the use of such terms still risks a powerful backlash. In September, for instance, when Bettina Kudla, a lawmaker for Merkel’s CDU, used “Umvolkung” in her   tweet, the retribution was swift.  Michael   chief whip of the CDU and its sister party, the CSU, decried her tweet as “unspeakable. ” The CDU’s secretary general, Peter Tauber, denounced it as “completely unacceptable in tone and content. ” By October, Kudla’s office in her home constituency had been vandalized. Ultimately, the CDU did not nominate her for reelection next year. But her linguistic bomb won high accolades, too.  “Making a Nazi comparison because of the word ‘Umvolkung’ is remarkably stupid,” one supporter  —   Peter Martin  —   wrote on her Facebook page. “In the 21st century, no one gives a damn about the Nazi era . . . The future belongs to patriots. ”                  "

"," About a year ago,    college student Lauren Batchelder stood up at a political forum in New Hampshire and told Donald Trump that she didn’t think he was “a friend to women. ” The next morning, Trump fired back on Twitter  —   calling Batchelder an “arrogant young woman” and accusing her of being a “plant” from a rival campaign. Her phone began ringing with callers leaving threatening messages that were often sexual in nature. Her Facebook and email inboxes filled with similar messages. As her addresses circulated on social media and her photo flashed on the news, she fled home to hide. “I didn’t really know what anyone was going to do,” said Batchelder, now 19, who has never discussed her experience with a reporter until now. “He was only going to tweet about it and that was it, but I didn’t really know what his supporters were going to do, and that to me was the scariest part. ” This is what happens when Trump targets a private citizen who publicly challenges him. When Trump tweeted about Batchelder in October 2015, he had fewer than 5 million followers; he now has more than 17 million and has bragged that having a Twitter account is “like owning the New York Times without the losses. ” Twitter has become Trump’s   wand, allowing him to quickly act on a fleeting idea, a fit of anger or something he sees on television. Now that he is the   the power of Trump’s tweets has only increased.   Left, Donald Trump addresses the No Labels Problem Solver Convention in Manchester, N. H. in 2015. Right, Lauren Batchelder listens as Trump answers her question. (Reuters,   AP)  With one tweet, Trump can change headlines on cable news, move financial markets or cause world leaders to worry. With one tweet last week, Trump inflamed a conflict with China. With another tweet on Tuesday, Trump caused Boeing stock to plummet. With a third on Wednesday night, Trump prompted a series of threatening calls to the home of a union leader who had called him a liar.  Although Trump said months ago that he was likely to give up Twitter if elected, he has shown little sign of doing so. He will soon inherit the @POTUS account, which has 12. 5 million followers. “I think I am very restrained, and I talk about important things,” Trump said during an interview with the “Today” show this week. “Frankly, it’s a   form of communication. . . . I get it out much faster than a press release. I get it out much more honestly than dealing with . . . dishonest reporters. So many reporters are dishonest. ” For Batchelder, who studies history and gender studies at Saint Anselm College in Manchester, N. H, the abuse continues more than a year later. Five days before the election, she received a Facebook message that read: “Wishing I could     punch you in the face. id then proceed to stomp your head on the curb and urinate in your bloodied mouth and i know where you live, so watch your     back punk. ”  During her first semester at Saint Anselm in fall 2015, Batchelder decided to volunteer for former Florida governor Jeb Bush’s campaign, even though her views were much more liberal than his. To her, it was just an enjoyable opportunity to learn more about the Republican Party. She listed the volunteer position on her online résumé but later realized that she truly is a Democrat. On Oct. 12, 2015, Batchelder attended a bipartisan forum in Manchester and said to Trump: “So, maybe I’m wrong, maybe you can prove me wrong, but I don’t think you’re a friend to women. ”             Caption   The   saluted workers at a plant where he says he saved more than 1, 000 jobs, then went to Ohio.

","  LONDON  —   A Dutch court found   politician Geert Wilders guilty Friday of insulting an ethnic group and inciting discrimination after he led chants against Moroccans, a conviction he promptly denounced as “madness. ” Wilders, the controversial leader of the Netherlands’   Freedom Party (PVV) said he plans to appeal the verdict delivered by a panel of three “hating” judges. His party is leading in polls ahead of the country’s upcoming general election in March. “Three PVV hating judges declare that Moroccans are a race and convict me and half of the Netherlands. Madness,” he wrote in a Twitter message after the verdict.  In March 2014, Wilders sparked outrage at a rally in The Hague after asking supporters whether they wanted more or fewer Moroccan immigrants in the Netherlands. The crowd chanted: “Fewer! Fewer!” Wilders responded, “We’re going to organize that. ” More than 6, 400 people filed official complaints to the police, a sampling of which were read out in court. The court imposed no punishment on Wilders, saying the conviction was punishment enough. The prosecution wanted to impose a fine of 5, 000 euros ($5, 288). The “inflammatory” way statements were made at the rally encouraged others to discriminate against Moroccans, the court said, but it found there was “insufficient evidence” to convict Wilders of a separate charge of inciting hatred. Wilders, 53, is one of a number of populist politicians across Europe who are riding a tide of   anger, fueled in part by concerns over immigration and sluggish economies. The flamboyant Dutch politician has been compared to Donald Trump and sometimes uses the hashtag #MakeTheNetherlandsGreatAgain. On election night in the United States, he wrote on Twitter, “The people are taking their country back, so will we. ” If he becomes the next Dutch prime minister, Wilders has vowed to ban the Koran, close mosques and Islamic schools and stop immigration from Muslim countries. He has also said he would support a “Nexit” referendum, with the hopes that the Netherlands would follow Britain’s example and vote to leave the European Union.  Wilders boycotted much of the trial, but during a court appearance Nov. 23, he said that he had a right to free speech and accused rival politicians of conducting a “witch hunt. ” Wilders has also said the conviction would do little to silence him. “Millions of Dutch are sick and tired of political correctness,” he said with his usual rhetorical flair in a video posted Friday on YouTube. “You can count on one thing  —   I will never be silent. ”       "

","     President Obama has authorized a    pay increase for federal employees, just in time for the Christmas bills. In letters to the House and Senate, Obama authorized an average pay raise for 2017 of 2. 1 percent, instead of the 1. 6 percent he submitted in August. “However, in light of the decision of Congress to provide a 2. 1 percent pay increase for military personnel in 2017 and reconsideration of current and projected economic conditions, I have concluded it would be appropriate to revise my original alternative plan for locality payments so that the total combined cost of the 1. 0 percent    base pay increase and varying locality payments will be 2. 1 percent of basic payroll,” Obama wrote. The military raise was included in the National Defense Authorization Act passed by Congress this week. The raise takes effect in January. “When the final 2017 National Defense Authorization Act set the military raise at 2. 1 percent at the end of November, the NTEU contacted key members of Congress to ask them to urge the President to change his original proposal to 2. 1 percent,” said National Treasury Employees Union President Tony Reardon. “It was our view that the federal pay raise wasn’t a done deal and could be adjusted. ” “We thank the members of Congress who listened to our views on this issue and stepped up as champions of the federal workforce,” Reardon said in a statement. “NTEU is especially grateful to House Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer (Md.)

","       Well before he exited the Earth’s atmosphere, John Glenn flew at least 149 combat missions  —   59 during World War II and 90 during the Korean War. It must have been difficult on his wife, Annie Glenn (maiden name, Castor). To ease her fear, before each mission Glenn would utter the same words: “I’m just going down to the corner store to get a pack of gum. ” “Don’t be long,” she would always respond. He said it before he was propelled into space on Feb. 20, 1962, to become the first American to orbit the Earth. Years later, in 1998 when John  —   a man possessing an “otherworldly spirit”  —   would exit Earth’s gravitational pull at 77 years old, for the final time, they repeated the dialogue.  This time, he slipped her the perfect coda  —   a pack of gum  —   which she kept in a breast pocket until he returned to earth.      John Glenn, the first American to orbit the earth and the oldest man in space, has died at 95. (Thomas   Washington Post)   John and Annie were a strong couple  —   married 73 years  —   but while John spent his life in the air and on television, Annie spent hers here on Earth, focused on the people who often go unseen: the disabled. “It really is worth everything to be able to help people,” Annie told The Washington Post in 1984. And she did  —   despite, or more accurately because of, all she had to overcome.  To many, theirs was an odd pairing. As John himself wrote: “We practically grew up in the same playpen. We never knew a time when we didn’t know each other. ” (Annie says they were 2 years old when they met.) But they were different. John was athletic and outgoing while Annie barely spoke, not because she didn’t have anything to say, but because when she did, people often assumed she was either deaf or mentally deficient. For most of her life, Annie was afflicted with an 85 percent stutter, meaning she would become “hung up on 85 percent of the words she tried to speak, which was a severe handicap,” as John put it. Those years must have been torture for Annie. Some of the inconveniences might seem small. John recalled them: For Annie, stuttering meant not being able to take a taxi because she would have to write out the address and give it to the driver because she couldn’t get the words out. It would be too embarrassing to try to talk about where she wanted to go. Going to the store is a tremendously difficult and frustrating experience when you can’t find what you want and can’t ask the clerk because you are too embarrassed of your stutter. Others were large. As The Post reported, once her daughter stepped on a nail. As blood gushed out, Annie couldn’t speak well enough to call 911. Instead, she found a neighbor to make the call for her.  She spent the early years of their marriage avoiding the spotlight. While John seemed to enjoy the television cameras, he clearly cared more for her privacy.    Annie and John Glenn ride in the back of an open car with Vice President Lyndon Johnson during a parade in Glenn’s honor in Washington on Feb. 26, 1962. (AP)  In his book about the Mercury Seven astronauts, “The Right Stuff,” Tom Wolfe recalled an incident perfectly highlighting this fact. John had just sat for five hours in the Friendship 7 capsule, but the mission was eventually scrapped due to the weather. Meanwhile, Annie sat in their home with Vice President Lyndon Johnson sitting outside and, in Wolfe’s words, hoping to “pour ten minutes of hideous Texas soul all over her on nationwide TV. ” Annie stuttered this to John over the phone, as he prepared to climb out of his spacesuit. She didn’t want the media attention, not with her stutter. “Look, if you don’t want the vice president or the TV networks or anybody else to come into the house, then that’s it as far as I’m concerned,” John told her. “They are not coming in and I will back you up all the way and you tell them that! I don’t want Johnson or any of the rest of them to put so much as one toe inside our house!” “As the wife of a famous astronaut, I had to deal with being constantly in the public eye. I had to deal with the press. And if this wasn’t hard enough, I had to do it all with a severe handicap,” Annie told The Post. She continued, “Those were difficult times for me. In times of difficulty or defeat, it’s easy to think that we really have no choices. That we are trapped. I know I felt that way. Having tried, having failed so many times. ”  Then, one day in 1973, the couple was watching the “Today” show. A doctor was discussing a new method of treatment for stutterers, an intensive   program in Roanoke. Annie enrolled. They made her relearn each letter of the alphabet. They forced her to go to a shopping center  —   and shop. To ask questions, for the first time. The enrollees weren’t allowed to call friends or family for that three weeks. When it was over, Annie picked up the telephone. “When I called John, he cried,” Annie said. “People just couldn’t believe that I could really talk. ” And when she got home, according to John’s memoir, she talked. He recalled one of her first lines: “John, I’ve wanted to tell you this for years. Pick up your socks. ” Joking aside, she was 53 years old, and she had found her calling.      Annie Glenn talks about the intensive   program in Roanoke that she attended in 1973 in order to overcome her stutter. (ASHA)   Annie began giving speeches on behalf of her husband when he ran for Senate. After each speech, she would rush to greet those everyone else ignored  —   the disabled. As The Post’s Myra MacPherson observed in 1984: After years of cruel slurs, of being overlooked by strangers, Annie Glenn seeks out the handicapped. In a crowd, she heads straight for those in wheelchairs. She has a sort of radar; finds the shyest person in the room and takes the time to draw him out. A group of deaf people were in the audience at one of her husband’s speeches. Afterward, Annie Glenn went over to them and soon was learning sign language. As the press crowded around Glenn, he looked over at his wife, who was signing “I Love You” to the deaf. “That’s what you should be covering,” he told the reporters. Deciding to help those in need, she became an adjunct professor with the Speech Pathology Department at Ohio State University’s Department of Speech and Hearing Science. “She is incredibly inspirational to students, many who have not had that much contact with people who stutter,” Rebecca McCauley, a professor in the department said. “Her influence is quite huge when speaking to students who are just getting into the field. ”  In recognition of Annie (and John) the school renamed a street on its campus to Annie and John Glenn Avenue in 2015. By that point, though, Annie had received many honors for her work with those trying to overcome their stutters. In 1983, she received the first national award of the American Speech and Hearing Association for “providing an inspiring model for people with communicative disorders. ” Eventually, the association named an award after her. In 1987, the first recipient of the Annie Glenn Award was James Earl Jones, an actor who had previously struggled with stuttering himself.    Annie and John Glenn ride in a parade in New York City on Nov. 16, 1998. (Mike  )  With John’s death on Dec. 8, Annie Glenn, now 96, is alone for the first time in 73 years. But her life has been a testament to strength in adversity. As John Glenn once wrote of her: “It takes guts to operate with a disability. I don’t know if I would have had the courage to do all the things that Annie did so well. ” “We tend to think of heroes as being those who are well known,” he wrote, “but America is made up of a whole nation of heroes who face problems that are very difficult, and their courage remains largely unsung. Millions of individuals are heroes in their own right. ” “In my book, Annie is one of those heroes. ” More from Morning Mix: This telltale tail shows dinosaur feathers in ‘exquisite detail’ after 99 million years Why a million people might attend a girl’s 15th birthday party in rural Mexico These Ga. police officers grew up together.

","     “Are you going live?” It would be the final question Brooke Miranda Hughes would hear before a   plowed into the back of her car as it crawled down Interstate 380 in Pennsylvania just after midnight Tuesday. Chaniya   the passenger who posed the question, was referring to Facebook Live, which Hughes had just launched to broadcast live from her moving vehicle, according to the Scranton  . The final moments of their young lives  —   marked by a flash of lights, screeching tires and then seven minutes of blackness  —   were captured on the   video after Hughes, sitting behind the wheel, held her phone near her face for the rest of the world to see. Hughes, 18, and   19, were declared dead at the scene. The driver of the truck that killed them was uninjured, according to the Associated Press. Video of the incident, which began so innocuously, was posted on Hughes’ Facebook page, where it has been watched more than 7, 000 times, according to the  .  Facebook Live launched in 2015 and allows users to stream live video to their Facebook pages, where others can watch in real time, or after the fact. The service is used in a variety of capacities, from broadcasting breaking news, protests and events to giving lectures or communicating with friends. Chris Cox, Facebook’s chief product officer, told CBS News in April that Facebook Live allows users to bring “a little TV studio” to their pockets. It was via Facebook Live that Diamond Reynolds broadcast the aftermath of the fatal police shooting of her boyfriend during a traffic stop in a Twin Cities suburb. “Stay with me,” she told Philando Castile. Her Facebook video quickly spread across social media and cable news, turning the deadly July confrontation into one of the   fatal police shootings in recent years. Last month, prosecutors in Minnesota charged the officer who killed Castile with   manslaughter.      The officer who fatally shot Philando Castile, 32, has been charged with   manslaughter. Here’s what you need to know about the traffic stop gone wrong, which ended up   on Facebook. (Editor’s note: This video has been updated.) (Monica Akhtar, Jenny Starrs, Gillian   Washington Post)   Following the fatal crash in the Poconos this week, Samantha Piasecki, a    friend of the two victims, told the   that she had been in the car with Hughes and   earlier that night. But she asked to be dropped off at her mother’s house in Scranton, before the wreck. She told the paper that she ended up watching the crash video around 3 a. m. the same night. “It broke me,” she said. “They were both    people,” she told the paper. “They had good personalities. They had smiles that could light up dark rooms. Anytime you were with them it was always fun. ” Piasecki told the   that she’s   now because she feels like she “could have stopped it somehow” had she still been in the car.  Police told the   that Hughes was driving slowly in the right southbound lane of   when the wreck occurred. One of the car’s wheels had been replaced with a spare tire, but it did not have a flat tire, as some early reports suggested, police said. Police, who did not immediately respond to requests for comment Thursday, told the   that the investigation is ongoing. They have not determined whether the driver of the   Michael Jay Parks of Tobyhanna, Penn. will face charges. The video, however unsettling, is not considered a violation of Facebook’s community standards, according to a Facebook spokesman. “However,” the spokesman added, “a graphic warning screen has been added,   has been disabled and it is not accessible for users under the age of 18. “Additionally, the user’s account has been memorialized. ” Hughes was a student at West Scranton High School, according to the  . Her Facebook page says she worked at McDonalds. On a GoFundMe page started to raise money for  ’s funeral, she was described as having an “energetic” spirit. “Her jokes and faces that made you laugh,” the page’s description says. “Although Chaniya was only 19 she was full of so much life, positivity, and love that she could bring anyone out of the darkest place and make you think the world was sunshine and rainbows. ” Since Facebook Live launched in April, millions have used the service to offer a glimpse into the big moments and small details of their lives. The view isn’t always pretty.  In September, a man who had just critically injured his   and fatally shot his namesake son in North Carolina made a chilling confession on Facebook Live. “She lied on me, had warrants taken out on me,” Earl Valentine told the camera while driving on a dark road. “She drug me all the way down to nothing. I loved my wife, but she deserved what she had coming. ” Valentine acknowledged that the violent chain of events he started could end in his own death. “Pleasure knowing all y’all,” he said. “I’ve been very sick for months. And this is something that I could not help. So I don’t know if I’m gonna make it where I’m going, but if I don’t, I wish all of you a good life. ” Within hours, authorities located Valentine at a motel in Columbia, S. C. where, they said, he committed suicide after being surrounded. Valentine yet another example of a person using Facebook Live to discuss a violent act  —   or to showcase the act itself. In June, Larossi Abballa, a terrorism suspect accused of killing a French police captain and his partner in their home, broadcast the aftermath of the attack on Facebook Live. An occasionally tearful Abballa, speaking a mix of French and Arabic, swore allegiance to the Islamic State militant group and encouraged others to follow his example and kill police. A month later, a Georgia mother went on her daughter’s Facebook account to broadcast herself beating the teenager  —   punishment for posting sexually explicit pictures on the site. “This is my page now,” Shanavia Miller told the camera after she fixed her hair. “Now I’m gonna need y’all to send this viral. Please share this because I’m not done. More to come. ” A July shooting in Norfolk that injured three men was inadvertently captured on Facebook Live. In the video, three men are sitting in a car, smoking and listening to rap music. Five minutes into the video, there’s a series of 30 gunshots. The nascent   service is raising philosophical questions about the power of unfiltered Internet video that can reach millions instantly. As The Post’s Caitlin Dewey wrote in July: Facebook Live, which launched globally in April, has quickly emerged as one of the Internet’s dominant platforms for streaming unfiltered,   video. As Facebook has learned in the past week, however, that status comes with unique challenges.   video is exceedingly difficult to moderate, as it reaches its largest audience instantaneously and can be redacted only after that moment of impact. That limits the power of even a dedicated,   moderation team, which Facebook Live has. Despite growing concern that the tool could be abused  —   several shootings, a police standoff and an accused jihadist’s confession have streamed on Facebook already  —   the company has remained intentionally (and characteristically) vague on the composition and guidelines of its moderation team. The deaths of the two Pensylvannia teens came shortly after a    Rhode Island man broadcast himself on Facebook Live driving erratically and reaching speeds up to 115 mph before hitting a dump truck, skidding across three lanes and slamming into a median, according to ABC News. In that video, Onasi Olio Roja can be seen weaving in and out of traffic, blasting rap music and yelling, “Let’s get it papi!”  —   moments before he totals his car. “How lucky we are that no one else was hurt,” said Capt. John Allen of the Rhode Island State Police said. “It’s a grand slam of things not to do. ” He was charged with reckless driving and operating a suspended license and arraigned from his hospital bed over the weekend, according to CBS affiliate WPRI. In February, an Ohio teenager pleaded not guilty after she was accused of using a different   service, Periscope, to broadcast the rape of her    friend. Marina Lonina, 18, a student at New Albany High School, outside Columbus, was attempting to record the assault as evidence, her attorney, Sam Shamansky maintained. “She’s in the habit of filming everything with this app called Periscope,” Shamansky acknowledged at a court hearing in April, according to ABC affiliate WSYX. “She does everything possible to contain the situation even to the point of asking while it’s being filmed to these Periscope followers, ‘What should I do now? What should I do now? ’” Lonina faces charges of rape, sexual battery, kidnapping and pandering sexually oriented matter involving a juvenile and is due to appear in court on Dec. 12, according to the Columbus Dispatch.

","     When Charles Darwin examined an orchid from Madagascar with a nearly   nectary, he was certain that a corresponding moth, one with an exceptionally long proboscis must exist. More than two decades after Darwin died, a moth matching this specification was identified. And more than 80 years after that, it was further confirmed: The Xanthopan morganii was documented feeding on this exact flower. This moth is one of the fascinating examples of the extraordinary ways in which plants and animals have adapted elegant solutions for survival, collected in photographer Robert Clark’s new work, “Evolution” (Phaidon) with text by Joseph Wallace. Clark wholeheartedly embraces the idea that examples of evolution are all around us, if you just know where to look.    “I was never more interested in any subject in all my life than this of Orchids,” Charles Darwin wrote to his friend the botanist Joseph Hooker. Darwin’s most famous connection to these diverse and widespread plants involved Angraecum sesquipedale (now commonly known as Darwin’s orchid) a species from Madagascar. Studying it, Darwin understood that the species could be pollinated only by a moth with a proboscis far longer than any yet seen on Earth. A variety of “experts” ridiculed Darwin’s prediction, published in 1862, that such a moth must exist somewhere on Madagascar. (Ridicule was an experience he must have been used to by then.) It wasn’t until 1903 that collectors found the exact moth that he’d said was out there: Xanthopan morganii, originally given the subspecies name praedicta in recognition of the great man who predicted its existence. (Robert   of Phaidon)     Alfred Russel collected these pittas on Borneo and Sumatra, islands that lie west of what is still called the “Wallace Line. ” Wallace was struck by the fact that mainly Asian fauna are found to the west of the line and Australian to the east, making the region a prime exhibit of how geographic isolation can lead to the evolution of new species. (Robert   of Phaidon)     The physical changes wrought by artificial (or domestic) selection in the pigeons Charles Darwin bred included feathers that grew up instead of down (as in the Jacobin, right) and overlarge crops (the pouter pigeon, left). (Robert   of Phaidon)     Not so long ago, it was a controversial theory, but now it’s widely accepted: Birds aren’t just  ; they are in fact living dinosaurs. That’s true of everything from sparrows to eagles to Darwin’s finches  —   but it’s rarely more obvious than when looking at a southern cassowary (Casuarius casuarius) the flightless bird native to Australia and New Guinea that at 5 feet tall and over 100 pounds is one of the largest and heaviest birds on Earth. (Robert   of Phaidon)     Crocodile eyes have evolved an assortment of specializations that make them suited to the animals’   environment, choice of prey and hunting technique. The eyes are protected with a third eyelid, a membrane that slides across when the reptile submerges, while the eyeballs themselves can be drawn into the eye sockets during an attack. Meanwhile, a thin layer of guanine crystals (called the retinal tapetum) lies just behind the eyes. By reflecting light back through the retina, it intensifies the image, aiding crocodiles as they hunt in   situations. (Robert   of Phaidon)     According to the scale of typical evolution, most dog breeds have been in existence for only an eyeblink of time. But by the standards of human history, many are practically ancient, demonstrating both the longevity and the tightness of the bond between humans and canines. For example, the Afghan hound, though having a less   past, has a   history in Afghanistan and surrounding areas. (Robert   of Phaidon)     A fetus of a donkey exhibits many of the features that distinguish the family Equidae, which also includes horses and zebras. Astonishingly, scientists recently found a powerful tool to help untangle the complex evolutionary history of the family: a    colt leg bone that had been frozen in the tundra of Canada’s Yukon Territory. The bone’s excellent condition allowed scientists to map the ancient horse’s entire genome. (It remains by far the oldest DNA yet sequenced.) Among the researchers’ many findings from this scientific trove: Horses, donkeys and zebras appear to have evolved from a common ancestor 4 million to 4. 5 million years ago, or twice as long ago as previously thought. (Robert   of Phaidon)     In Charles Darwin’s time, widespread excavation for mines, farms and roads revealed something crucial: that neither the kinds of organisms that inhabit the earth, nor even the planet itself, remains static. One spectacular proof of this was provided by the discovery of the Western Interior Seaway, a vast, shallow ocean that in the Cretaceous Period ranged from what is now eastern Mexico all the way to northern Canada. How do paleontologists know that this area, mostly now far removed from any marine environment, had once been a sea? Because they found fossils belonging to the huge marine reptiles called the plesiosaurs and mosasaurs there, along with gigantic sharks, other fish and crinoids (echinoderm relatives of sea urchins and sea stars) such as this beautiful specimen of Uintacrinus socialis from Kansas. (Robert   of Phaidon)     “The combination of good sedimentary conditions and the fact that animals, including hominids, like to be near a source of water,” the great paleoanthropologist Richard Leakey said, helps explain why the remains of human ancestors  —   and many other creatures  —   are so often found near the shores of lakes. These beautiful human footprints, about 120, 000 years old, were discovered south of Lake Natron, Tanzania. (Robert   of Phaidon)     The skeletons of an orangutan and a giraffe demonstrate the breadth of mammalian evolution. Orangutans were one of the species that drew Alfred Russel Wallace to the forests of Sarawak on the island of Borneo, where he developed his theory of evolution. And Charles Darwin wrote extensively about the giraffe, whose long neck  —   well adapted to treetop browsing  —   he considered a striking illustration of natural selection.

142171,217557,Trump expected to pick ExxonMobil chief Rex Tillerson as his secretary of state,Washington Post,Steven Mufson,2016-12-10,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161211001801/https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/trump-expected-to-pick-exxonmobil-chief-executive-rex-tillerson-as-his-secretary-of-state/2016/12/10/6e018e90-bd9e-11e6-94ac-3d324840106c_story.html
","   Donald Trump is expected to name as his secretary of state Rex Tillerson, the chief executive of ExxonMobil, who has worked extensively around the globe and built relationships with such leaders as Russian President Vladi mir Putin, three people close to the transition team confirmed Saturday. Tillerson’s nomination could face intense scrutiny in the Senate, considering his years of work in Russia and the Middle East on behalf of the multinational petroleum company. Already, two leading Republican hawks, Sens. John McCain (Ariz.) and Lindsey O. Graham (S. C.) have voiced concerns about Tillerson’s serving as the nation’s top diplomat because of his ties to Putin. Trump spokesman Jason Miller said Saturday that there would be no official announcement about a secretary of state until this coming week “at the earliest. ” But three officials briefed on Trump’s deliberations, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter, said the pick would be Tillerson, barring a late and unanticipated shift in Trump’s thinking. NBC News first reported that Trump has settled on Tillerson. Trump is considering nominating for deputy secretary of state John R. Bolton, a former ambassador to the United Nations and a combative hawk whose tenure in the George W. Bush administration was controversial, two of the officials said.     View Graphic    Here are the people whose names have been floated for Trump’s Cabinet  Trump spent a month deliberating over the secretary of state position and interviewed an array of candidates, including Mitt Romney, the 2012 GOP presidential nominee, who was opposed by some of Trump’s closest advisers because he had been the face of the Republican resistance to Trump’s presidential candidacy. Other contenders included former New York mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and Bob Corker ( .) chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. The search at times resembled Trump’s reality television show, “The Apprentice,” with the hopefuls parading before journalists  —   and, in the case of Giuliani, publicly campaigning for the job before announcing Friday that he had withdrawn himself from consideration.  Tillerson’s stock rose late in the process, after he met with the   on Tuesday and again on Saturday morning at Trump Tower in New York. Trump settled on Tillerson, 64, because he projects gravitas, is regarded as a skillful manager and personally knows many foreign leaders through his dealings on behalf of the energy giant, people close to Trump said. In an excerpt of an interview with Fox News, which will be aired in full Sunday, Trump praises Tillerson, although he does not reveal his decision. “He’s much more than a business executive; he’s a   player,” Trump says. “He knows many of the players, and he knows them well. He does massive deals in Russia  —   for the company, not for himself. ” Tillerson’s nomination would fit the pattern of other Trump appointments  —   wealthy business leaders with little experience in policymaking. But Tillerson has spent years dealing with the complexities of one of the world’s biggest enterprises, spanning six continents and about six dozen nations.             Caption     Donald Trump faces a challenge as he prepares for his move to the White House: selecting the men and women who will fill his administration.  Labor Secretary nominee Andrew Puzder Andrew Puzder, a   executive who has been a vocal critic of substantially increasing the minimum wage and an opponent of rules that would make more workers eligible for overtime pay, is the nominee to lead the Labor Department, according to a Republican briefed on the decision.

","         So far,   Donald Trump’s Cabinet picks have mostly been either multimillionaire and billionaire executives or retired generals. In that context, it’s probably less of a surprise that Trump may be close to selecting ExxonMobil chief executive Rex Tillerson as secretary of state, elevating a   prospect who may surge past seasoned political actors like Mitt Romney and Sen. Bob Corker ( .) in the stretch. Tillerson’s hardly an unknown character on the world stage, but he’s probably not too familiar to Americans. As such, we’ve put together a brief profile of the man who may soon be in charge of the United States’ international diplomacy. Tillerson has no experience in the public sector, a first in modern history for a potential secretary of state. Tillerson, 64, joined ExxonMobil in 1975, after receiving a civil engineering degree from the University of Texas. He worked his way up through the ranks, beginning as a production engineer and becoming chairman and chief executive in 2006. Over his decades at the company, Tillerson’s work took him all over the world, including to Yemen and Russia. That, along with his experience as CEO, apparently provides the basis of his familiarity with international diplomacy. On Twitter, a former ExxonMobil employee who is now at Brookings Institution defended Tillerson’s experience. “Oil folks know stuff: anyone who manages multibillion dollar,   projects needs deep, nuanced understanding of political context,” Suzanne Maloney wrote on Twitter. “  …     Tillerson rose to top of a company that prizes technical excellence,   financials, hard work and integrity. State could do a lot worse. ” Tillerson received the Order of Friendship from Russian President Vladimir Putin in 2013. Tillerson’s work with ExxonMobil included a stretch working for Exxon Neftegas Ltd. putting him in charge of the subsidiary’s fields in Russia and the Caspian Sea. Two years before receiving the award, ExxonMobil won a contract to explore for oil in a   portion of the Arctic Ocean, which was made more economically viable for drilling in part thanks to the sea ice decline that’s followed global warming. Putin himself announced the deal at a meeting in Sochi (where the Winter Olympics would be held the next year). Tillerson’s stake in ExxonMobil will certainly raise questions at a confirmation hearing. Once Russia annexed Crimea in 2014, the United States instituted sanctions against Russia that froze ExxonMobil’s Arctic agreement. Were those sanctions to be lifted, the deal would probably move forward  —   making Tillerson’s shares of ExxonMobil stock much more valuable. (The Wall Street Journal noted that he’d probably have to divest from that stock if appointed to run the State Department.) Tillerson’s position on climate change may be to the left of Trump’s. ExxonMobil understood the connection between greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel use and the warming climate as early as 1977, according to recent reporting. It then proceeded to combat the idea, recognizing the risk posed to its industry by curtailing fossil fuel use. Only fairly recently did it acknowledge that link publicly, and the company is now on record in support of accepting the established science and identifying solutions to the problem of climate change. That shift happened under Tillerson’s leadership. The issue of climate change will be a potent one for whoever takes over the State Department, given the   international diplomacy efforts to address the issue. Shortly before this year’s election, ExxonMobil issued a statement in support of the sweeping agreement reached in Paris at the end of last year aimed at cutting down on carbon dioxide emissions internationally. Trump said repeatedly on the campaign trail that he opposed the Paris agreement and has regularly expressed his opposition to taking action to address climate change. Tillerson, as CEO, promoted positions contrary to that. His most recent personal comments echoed the sentiment of his company, calling the threat of climate change “real” and “serious”  —   though the extent to which he was speaking as a representative of ExxonMobil vs. his own views is worth asking. Tillerson is a lifelong Boy Scout. Tillerson was an Eagle Scout in his youth and eventually became president of the national organization. It was under his leadership  —   and through his advocacy  —   that the organization embraced the membership of young men who identified as gay. Tillerson’s positions on a variety of other political issues are largely unknown. Climate change is central to what we know about Tillerson, thanks to the industry of his   employer. The Wall Street Journal noted that Tillerson supports free trade  —   which, as a CEO of a major international corporation, is probably a natural position. Beyond that, it’s not clear where Tillerson’s politics align with or differ from his possible boss’s. His political giving suggests an alignment with establishment Republican politics, having given to the Republican Party of Texas repeatedly, to House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (Wis.) and to other national Republican priorities. So it probably isn’t a surprise that. .. . .. Tillerson originally supported Jeb Bush for president. He gave Bush the maximum allowable contribution in September 2015."
142173,217559,Secret CIA assessment says Russia was trying to help Trump win White House,Washington Post,Adam Entous,2016-12-09,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161211001801/https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/obama-orders-review-of-russian-hacking-during-presidential-campaign/2016/12/09/31d6b300-be2a-11e6-94ac-3d324840106c_story.html
"," The CIA has concluded in a secret assessment that Russia intervened in the 2016 election to help Donald Trump win the presidency, rather than just to undermine confidence in the U. S. electoral system, according to officials briefed on the matter. Intelligence agencies have identified individuals with connections to the Russian government who provided WikiLeaks with thousands of hacked emails from the Democratic National Committee and others, including Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman, according to U. S. officials. Those officials described the individuals as actors known to the intelligence community and part of a wider Russian operation to boost Trump and hurt Clinton’s chances.     “It is the assessment of the intelligence community that Russia’s goal here was to favor one candidate over the other, to help Trump get elected,” said a senior U. S. official briefed on an intelligence presentation made to U. S. senators. “That’s the consensus view. ”     The Post’s Ellen Nakashima goes over the events and discusses the hacker groups responsible. (Jhaan   Washington Post)   The Obama administration has been debating for months how to respond to the alleged Russian intrusions, with White House officials concerned about escalating tensions with Moscow and being accused of trying to boost Clinton’s campaign.  In September, during a secret briefing for congressional leaders, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell ( .) voiced doubts about the veracity of the intelligence, according to officials present. The Trump transition team dismissed the findings in a short statement issued Friday evening. “These are the same people that said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. The election ended a long time ago in one of the biggest Electoral College victories in history. It’s now time to move on and ‘Make America Great Again,’ ” the statement read.  Trump has consistently dismissed the intelligence community’s findings about Russian hacking. “I don’t believe they interfered” in the election, he told Time magazine this week. The hacking, he said, “could be Russia. And it could be China. And it could be some guy in his home in New Jersey. ” The CIA shared its latest assessment with key senators in a   briefing on Capitol Hill last week, in which agency officials cited a growing body of intelligence from multiple sources. Agency briefers told the senators it was now “quite clear” that electing Trump was Russia’s goal, according to the officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence matters.     Sen. Lindsey O. Graham ( . C.) says he wants to investigate whether Russia interfered with the 2016 U. S. election, among claims that Donald Trump’s rhetoric on Russia and Vladimir Putin is too soft. (Peter   Washington Post)   The CIA presentation to senators about Russia’s intentions fell short of a formal U. S. assessment produced by all 17 intelligence agencies. A senior U. S. official said there were minor disagreements among intelligence officials about the agency’s assessment, in part because some questions remain unanswered. For example, intelligence agencies do not have specific intelligence showing officials in the Kremlin “directing” the identified individuals to pass the Democratic emails to WikiLeaks, a second senior U. S. official said. Those actors, according to the official, were “one step” removed from the Russian government, rather than government employees. Moscow has in the past used middlemen to participate in sensitive intelligence operations so it has plausible deniability. Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, has said in a television interview that the “Russian government is not the source. ” The White House and CIA officials declined to comment. On Friday, the White House said President Obama had ordered a “full review” of Russian hacking during the election campaign, as pressure from Congress has grown for greater public understanding of exactly what Moscow did to influence the electoral process. “We may have crossed into a new threshold, and it is incumbent upon us to take stock of that, to review, to conduct some   to understand what has happened and to impart some lessons learned,” Obama’s counterterrorism and homeland security adviser, Lisa Monaco, told reporters at a breakfast hosted by the Christian Science Monitor. Obama wants the report before he leaves office Jan. 20, Monaco said. The review will be led by James Clapper, the outgoing director of national intelligence, officials said. During her remarks, Monaco didn’t address the latest CIA assessment, which hasn’t been previously disclosed.  Seven Democratic senators last week asked Obama to declassify details about the intrusions and why officials believe that the Kremlin was behind the operation. Officials said Friday that the senators specifically were asking the White House to release portions of the CIA’s presentation. This week, top Democratic lawmakers in the House also sent a letter to Obama, asking for briefings on Russian interference in the election. U. S. intelligence agencies have been cautious for months in characterizing Russia’s motivations, reflecting the United States’   struggle to collect reliable intelligence on President Vladi mir Putin and those closest to him. In previous assessments, the CIA and other intelligence agencies told the White House and congressional leaders that they believed Moscow’s aim was to undermine confidence in the U. S. electoral system. The assessments stopped short of saying the goal was to help elect Trump. On Oct. 7, the intelligence community officially accused Moscow of seeking to interfere in the election through the hacking of “political organizations. ” Though the statement never specified which party, it was clear that officials were referring to   into the computers of the DNC and other Democratic groups and individuals. Some key Republican lawmakers have continued to question the quality of evidence supporting Russian involvement. “I’ll be the first one to come out and point at Russia if there’s clear evidence, but there is no clear evidence  —   even now,” said Rep. Devin Nunes ( .) the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee and a member of the Trump transition team. “There’s a lot of innuendo, lots of circumstantial evidence, that’s it. ”  Though Russia has long conducted cyberspying on U. S. agencies, companies and organizations, this presidential campaign marks the first time Moscow has attempted through   to interfere in, if not actively influence, the outcome of an election, the officials said. The reluctance of the Obama White House to respond to the alleged Russian intrusions before Election Day upset Democrats on the Hill as well as members of the Clinton campaign. Within the administration, top officials from different agencies sparred over whether and how to respond. White House officials were concerned that covert retaliatory measures might risk an escalation in which Russia, with sophisticated   might have less to lose than the United States, with its vast and vulnerable digital infrastructure. The White House’s reluctance to take that risk left Washington weighing   measures, including the “naming and shaming” approach of publicly blaming Moscow. By   White House officials had decided it was time to take that step, but they worried that doing so unilaterally and without bipartisan congressional backing just weeks before the election would make Obama vulnerable to charges that he was using intelligence for political purposes. Instead, officials devised a plan to seek bipartisan support from top lawmakers and set up a secret meeting with the Gang of 12  —   a group that includes House and Senate leaders, as well as the chairmen and ranking members of both chambers’ committees on intelligence and homeland security. Obama dispatched Monaco, FBI Director James B. Comey and Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson to make the pitch for a “show of solidarity and bipartisan unity” against Russian interference in the election, according to a senior administration official. Specifically, the White House wanted congressional leaders to sign off on a bipartisan statement urging state and local officials to take federal help in protecting their   and balloting machines from Russian  . Though U. S. intelligence agencies were skeptical that hackers would be able to manipulate the election results in a systematic way, the White House feared that Russia would attempt to do so, sowing doubt about the fundamental mechanisms of democracy and potentially forcing a more dangerous confrontation between Washington and Moscow.  In a secure room in the Capitol used for briefings involving classified information, administration officials broadly laid out the evidence U. S. spy agencies had collected, showing Russia’s role in   in at least two states and in hacking the emails of the Democratic organizations and individuals. And they made a case for a united, bipartisan front in response to what one official described as “the threat posed by unprecedented meddling by a foreign power in our election process. ” The Democratic leaders in the room unanimously agreed on the need to take the threat seriously. Republicans, however, were divided, with at least two GOP lawmakers reluctant to accede to the White House requests. According to several officials, McConnell raised doubts about the underlying intelligence and made clear to the administration that he would consider any effort by the White House to challenge the Russians publicly an act of partisan politics. Some of the Republicans in the briefing also seemed opposed to the idea of going public with such explosive allegations in the final stages of an election, a move that they argued would only rattle public confidence and play into Moscow’s hands. McConnell’s office did not respond to a request for comment. After the election, Trump chose McConnell’s wife, Elaine Chao, as his nominee for transportation secretary. Some Clinton supporters saw the White House’s reluctance to act without bipartisan support as further evidence of an excessive caution in facing adversaries. “The lack of an administration response on the Russian hacking cannot be attributed to Congress,” said Rep. Adam B. Schiff (Calif.) the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, who was at the September meeting. “The administration has all the tools it needs to respond. They have the ability to impose sanctions. They have the ability to take clandestine means. The administration has decided not to utilize them in a way that would deter the Russians, and I think that’s a problem. ”  Philip Rucker contributed to this report.     "

Republicans now face an impossible choice.,Washington Post,Aaron Blake,2016-12-09,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161211001801/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/12/09/the-cia-concluded-russia-worked-to-elect-trump-republicans-now-face-an-impossible-choice/
","     This post has been updated with a defiant statement from the Trump transition team. The Washington Post is now reporting that the CIA has concluded something widely suspected but never flatly stated by the intelligence community: that Russia moved deliberately to help elect Donald Trump as president of the United States  —   not just to undermine the U. S. political process more generally. The Post’s report cites officials who say they have identified individuals connected to the Russian government who gave WikiLeaks emails hacked from the Democratic National Committee and top Hillary Clinton aide John Podesta. One official described the conclusion that this was intended to help Trump as “the consensus view. ” The report highlights and exacerbates the increasingly fraught situation in which congressional Republicans find themselves with regard to Russia and Trump. By acknowledging and digging into the increasing evidence that Russia helped  —   or at least attempted to help  —   tip the scales in Trump’s favor, they risk raising questions about whether Trump would have won without Russian intervention. Trump, after all, won by a margin of about 80, 000 votes cast across three states, winning each of the decisive states by less than one percentage point. So even a slight influence could have plausibly made the difference, though we’ll never be able to prove it one way or another.      CIA briefers told senators in a   briefing it was now ”quite clear” that electing Trump was Russia’s goal, according to officials. (Victoria   Washington Post)   While saying that Russia clearly tried to help Trump doesn’t inherently call into question the legitimacy of Trump’s win  —  earlier Friday, the White House made sure to emphasize that it’s not making that case  —   it’s not hard to connect the dots. And Trump and his party know it. The Post’s report cited Republicans who expressed skepticism about the available evidence when presented with it in September, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell ( . ). In addition, any GOP effort to dig into the matter risks antagonizing the   who has said flatly that he doesn’t believe Russia interfered with the election, despite receiving intelligence briefings to the contrary. And he’s proved more than willing to go after fellow Republicans who run afoul of him. On the other hand, if Republicans play down the issue, they risk giving a pass to an antagonistic foreign power that significant majorities of Americans and members of Congress do not trust and which, if the evidence is accurate, wields significant power to wage successful cyberwarfare with the United States. Already, House Democrats have begun pushing for something akin to the   Commission to look into allegations of Russian meddling. During the campaign, they pushed for hearings on the same issue. Until this week, they’d been unable to get much   from congressional Republicans. But Sen. Lindsey O. Graham ( . C.) voiced support for a probe on Wednesday, and now Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain ( .) says he is working with Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr ( . C.) on a   Senate probe, as The Post’s Karoun Demirjian reported Thursday. “I’m going after Russia in every way you can go after Russia,” Graham said. “I think they’re one of the most destabilizing influences on the world stage. I think they did interfere with our elections, and I want [Russian President Vladimir] Putin personally to pay the price. ” But even as these probes start to materialize, Trump is singing a far different tune. In his interview with Time magazine for his “Person of the Year” award, Trump suggested that the interference could just as well have come from someone in New Jersey as from the Russian government. “I don’t believe they interfered,” Trump said. “That became a laughing point  —   not a talking point, a laughing point. Any time I do something, they say, ‘Oh, Russia interfered. ’” Trump added: “It could be Russia. And it could be China. And it could be some guy in his home in New Jersey. ” Trump also maintained over and over again on the campaign trail that he wanted a better relationship with Russia and praised Putin as a strong leader  —   while minimizing Russia’s favoritism for his campaign. And he did all of this at a time when Putin was very unpopular in the United States and even as the evidence was pointing in the direction of Russian meddling. In other words, Trump has shown that he’s committed to seeing the best in Russia, and it’s unlikely another report from the “dishonest media” citing anonymous sources is going to change his mind. And Trump has every reason to continue to dig in. He doesn’t want to breathe any life into the story line that he owes his election to Russian interference. Trump, after all, is a winner, and the idea that someone else might have won it for him just won’t fly. Update: A statement from Trump’s transition team, as expected, took a defiant tone about The Post’s report: “These are the same people that said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. The election ended a long time ago in one of the biggest Electoral College victories in history. It’s now time to move on and ’Make America Great Again. ’” But for congressional Republicans, the evidence is increasingly getting to the point where they simply can’t ignore it, and some of them are feeling compelled to act  —   in a way that Trump isn’t likely to embrace. Compounding the dilemma for these Republicans is that many GOP and Trump voters are disinclined to think Russia meddled in the election. A poll released Friday by Democratic pollster Democracy Corps showed 55 percent of Trump voters and Republicans who didn’t vote for Trump say it’s probably true that stories alleging Russian interference in the election are conspiracy theories pushed by Clinton. Many Republicans are undoubtedly concerned about this. But as long as Trump is holding fast to the idea that this is all made up in an effort to undermine him, this whole thing could reinforce the   chasm within the GOP, with him and his base pitted against establishment Republicans who will (again) be made to look like they’re trying to take down their outsider  . And you can bet that’ll be how Trump pitches it. It all presents a possibly inauspicious start for the GOP Congress in the Trump era: a potential Trump vs.    over the same election that surprisingly installed him as president."

","     The CIA’s findings that Russia intervened in the 2016 election to help Donald Trump win the presidency are both “stunning and not surprising,” the next leader of Senate Democrats said, raising the need for Congress to conduct a full investigation. The statement from Sen. Charles E. Schumer ( . Y.) issued Saturday morning, was in response to a Washington Post story that intelligence agencies have identified individuals with connections to the Russian government who provided WikiLeaks with thousands of hacked emails from the Democratic National Committee to boost Trump and hurt Hillary Clinton’s chances. The CIA shared its latest assessment with key senators in a   briefing on Capitol Hill last week, in which agency officials cited a growing body of intelligence from multiple sources. Agency briefers told the senators it was now “quite clear” that electing Trump was Russia’s goal, according to the officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence matters.  “It is the assessment of the intelligence community that Russia’s goal here was to favor one candidate over the other, to help Trump get elected,” said a senior U. S. official briefed on the intelligence presentation made to U. S. senators. “That’s the consensus view. ”      CIA briefers told senators in a   briefing it was now ”quite clear” that electing Trump was Russia’s goal, according to officials.

The election ended a long time ago in one of the biggest Electoral College victories in history. It’s now time to move on and ‘Make America Great Again,’ ” the statement read.

","       Every year, my fellow movie reviewers and I bemoan the current state of cinema  —   Too many   flicks! Not enough substance! Where are the     flicks of yore? Wah, I’m bored!  —   only to realize that, when it’s time to compile our     lists, we’re (once again) spoiled for choice. This year has been particularly gratifying, if only for its sheer diversity  —   not only in terms of gender and ethnic representation in front of and behind the camera (Oscars won’t be nearly So White in 2017) but in terms of categories and platforms, with filmmakers reinvigorating classic genres with imagination, brio and unbridled love for a medium that felt vibrant and new, whether taking the form of   spectacle or a streaming visual album. Enough  ! Here’s a highly personal list of this year’s best movies, with quite a few honorables worth mentioning.       Set in Miami, ”Moonlight” takes place over three periods of a young black man’s life as he struggles to admit he’s gay. (A24 Films)    1. “Moonlight” Barry Jenkins’s adaptation of Tarell Alvin McCraney’s original story about a young man coming of age on the streets of Liberty City in Miami pulsed with life, observant drama and deep emotion. Jenkins’s elegant visual approach provided a flawless frame for some of the most indelible performances of the year, including by Mahershala Ali as an improbably tender drug dealer and Andre Holland as a highly evolved diner cook.       After the sudden death of Joe Chandler (Kyle Chandler) his younger brother Lee (Casey Affleck) is made legal guardian of Joe’s son Patrick (Lucas Hedges). (Roadside Attractions)    2. “Manchester By the Sea” In case you didn’t cry enough during “Moonlight,”   Kenneth Lonergan had you covered with this beautifully crafted drama about a man coming to terms with his tragic past. Written with Lonergan’s distinctive mix of observant humor and melancholy, the film starred Casey Affleck in a performance all the more breathtaking for its subtlety and stillness.    Chris Pine, left, and Ben Foster in “Hell or High Water. ” (Lorey   Films)   3. “Hell or High Water” A contemporary western about a couple of bank robbers eluding a crafty sheriff on the rawboned plains of Texas. Just what the world needs, right? But just as I was preparing a snippy tweet invoking “No Country For Old Men,” I saw the dang thing and it turned out to be terrific: Brilliantly written by Taylor Sheridan, perfectly executed by director David Mackenzie and featuring stunning performances from Jeff Bridges, Ben Foster and Chris Pine, this alternately funny and      tale entertained and evoked   economic realities with sensitivity and smarts.  4. “The Confirmation” This might be the best movie you didn’t see in 2016, if only because it had a   ’  it theatrical run before being shown on Netflix. No matter, there’s still time to enjoy this affecting   drama (are you detecting a theme?) about a flawed divorced dad spending a pivotal weekend with his son, who’s about to be confirmed. Written and directed by Bob Nelson, this quiet gem has the scruffy,   charm of Nelson’s previous script, for “Nebraska,” made all the more lovable by a cast that includes Clive Owen, Maria Bello and Patton Oswalt. Never has irreverence been made so reverent.      This ESPN documentary is broken into five parts and closely examines O. J. Simpson’s childhood, NFL career, murder trial and his life now. (ESPN)    5. “O. J.: Made in America” Ezra Edelman’s epic documentary about O. J. Simpson defied expectations that it would only rehash what we already knew about the idolized    murder suspect. Instead, Edelman created a sprawling yet meticulous portrait not just of the man, but of Los Angeles, collegiate and professional sports, celebrity, race and American culture.  6. “Cameraperson” Cinematographer Kirsten Johnson has filmed some of the most recognized nonfiction films of the past decade and a half, from “Fahrenheit  ” to “Citizenfour. ” In this deeply personal essay film, Johnson creates a collage of footage from those projects, as well as personal material with her family, to meditate on art, trauma, documentary ethics and the surpassing power of simply bearing witness to one another’s pain.       From the director of ”Whiplash,” this   stars Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling, who fall in love while trying to make it in Los Angeles. In this trailer, Ryan Gosling sings the melancholy ”City of Stars.” (Lionsgate)    7. “La La Land” Damien Chazelle (“Whiplash)”   sets out to save cinema with this throwback of a    musical that begins with an exhilaratingly staged production number set within a Los Angeles traffic jam. As a couple of kids looking to make it in showbiz, Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling keep right in step with the tonal shifts of a movie that indulges our most romantic,   pleasure centers while paying attention to pathos as well. Yum.       From the obvious theme of infidelity to the countless cameos, here’s an annotated look at Beyoncé’s new visual album, ”Lemonade.” (Nicki   Washington Post)    8. “Lemonade” Beyoncé proves to be a scholar of cinema history and a canny curator of   art in a “visual album” that showed the influences not just of Stanley Kubrick and Julie Dash, but of installation artist Pipilotti Rist and the great emerging filmmaker Khalik Allah. Sensuous, confrontational and drenched with unapologetic rage and beauty, this was an example of visual language at its most fluent and expressive.    Filmmaker Ava DuVernay’s critically acclaimed documentary “13th” featured interviews with such figures as activist and scholar Angela Davis. (Netflix)   9. “13th” Ava DuVernay’s documentary about the U. S. Constitution, criminal justice, racism and history qualifies as   viewing, touching on the animating political and philosophical issues of our era. On the heels of a comprehensive and enraging primer, DuVernay gifts the audience with what might be the most healing, heartening sequence of the year, simply by sharing joy, perseverance and the implacable insistence on survival despite all odds.       ”Southside With You” is the story of Barack and Michelle Obama’s very first date in Chicago in 1989, starring Parker Sawyers and Tika Sumpter as the young couple. (Roadside Attractions)     10. “Southside With You” The thought of a filmmaker making his   debut with a speculative romantic   about Barack and Michelle Obama’s first date is fraught at best. But Richard Tanne stuck the landing with a movie that captured its characters and their time and place in  ’80s Chicago with insight and impressive authenticity. As the lead couple, Tika Sumpter and Parker Sawyers delivered performances that were impressions rather than impersonations; by going back to the beginning, the film made a fitting goodbye to the couple that has occupied the White House for the past eight years.  Here are some movies that easily could have ended up on my top 10 list, had I not been constrained by numerical obstinacy: “Loving,” “Arrival,” “The Fits,” “A Bigger Splash,” “Love & Friendship,” “Sully,” “Captain Fantastic,” “Paterson,” “Eye in the Sky,” “Hail, Caesar! ,” “Last Days in the Desert,” “I Am Not Your Negro,” “Tower,” “Weiner,” “The Eagle Huntress” and “Jackie. ” Check them out if you haven’t already.

142177,217563,ISIS is back in the ancient Syrian city of Palmyra,Washington Post,Liz Sly,2016-12-10,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161211001801/https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/isis-is-back-in-the-ancient-syrian-city-of-palmyra/2016/12/10/d60523b3-21c5-4db7-883c-6f89305c1b25_story.html
","  BEIRUT  —   Islamic State militants fought their way back into the ancient Syrian city of Palmyra on Saturday nine months after they were driven out by Syrian government forces, in a reminder that the group is still a force to be reckoned with despite major losses of territory elsewhere. The advance into Palmyra seemed set to reverse a year of steady defeats for Islamic State fighters and came three days after a big offensive launched from three directions in the surrounding desert. Palmyra is the site of an ancient Roman complex of temples that is considered one of the world’s archaeological treasures, and work had recently begun on restoring some of the many ruins that were blown up during the Islamic State’s   occupation of the city. It is also the one place where Russian military intervention had made a significant difference in the fight against the Islamic State. Russian airstrikes facilitated the Syrian government’s recapture of Palmyra in March, and in May the Russian military escorted a planeload of journalists on a victory tour of the city, complete with a performance by a Russian orchestra.  Syrian activists and human rights monitors said Islamic State fighters entered the city itself late afternoon Saturday after government defenses collapsed. A Syrian activist from Palmyra who uses the name Khaled   said that by late evening, the militants controlled most of the city. Islamic State fighters were detaining young men and looting stores of weapons, he said. The offensive was aided by 200 Islamic State fighters who had made their way to the area from the Iraqi city of Mosul, according to the   Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. With street fighting continuing, it remained unclear whether the militants would be able fully to recapture the city. Russia Today quoted a Syrian military official as saying the Syrian government still has forces inside Palmyra and has not fully lost control, despite what the official described as “fierce clashes. ” The Islamic State has demonstrated a pattern in the past of launching spectacular attacks that catch its enemies unaware, only to be driven back once the defendants regroup. If the militants were to fully regain control of Palmyra, it would represent a startling reversal of 18 months of setbacks and suggest that the outright defeat of the group may still be a long way off. The Islamic State has not made any significant advances in either Syria or Iraq since it captured Palmyra and the Iraqi city of Ramadi in May 2015, and it has meanwhile lost vast swaths of territory in both countries, including Palmyra and Ramadi. The Palmyra advance coincides with a major U. S.  offensive by the Iraqi army for Mosul, where hopes for a swift victory are fading as the militants put up a stiff fight. They also still control large portions of Syria, including much of the vast eastern desert where Palmyra is located. The U. S. military announced Saturday that it was sending an additional 200 Special Operations troops to northern Syria to help the mostly Kurdish force that is battling the militants there.  The assault on Palmyra also comes as a further reminder that the Syrian army, despite substantial gains against rebel forces in recent weeks, is thinly spread, suffering from shortages of manpower and weary after more than five years of war. The   eastern portion of Aleppo seems poised to be recaptured soon by government troops, which are being aided by Iranian advisers, Shiite militias from Iraq, Afghanistan and Lebanon, and Russian airstrikes. The government has also been making   advances against   rebels around the capital, Damascus. But in a pattern that has become typical throughout Syria’s   war, gains on one front have meant drawing down troops on another, leaving government positions exposed. The militants had sliced through government lines in recent days, capturing some of Syria’s most important gas fields and sending government soldiers running for their lives. One video posted Friday by the Islamic State showed about a dozen Syrian soldiers fleeing through the desert as militants fired on them with heavy machine guns. Another posted Saturday showed them overrunning Syrian government sniper positions in the desert outside the city, kicking at the dead bodies of Syrian soldiers and sifting through the tents they had been living in.  Zakaria Zakaria in Istanbul and Louisa Loveluck in Beirut contributed to this report.       "
142178,217564,Taiwan is a country with history and people. It’s not just a diplomatic nuisance.,Washington Post,Shawna Yang Ryan,2016-12-09,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161211001801/https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2016/12/09/taiwan-is-a-country-with-history-and-people-its-not-just-a-diplomatic-nuisance/
","     In third grade, I received a school assignment to interview a family member. I chose my mother, who had immigrated to the United States after marrying my white American father. We began with a simple question. “Where were you born?” “Taiwan,” my mother answered. No, I argued. I had seen it with my own eyes: “Republic of China” in sharp black ink on the letters and packages my grandmother sent. I insisted that she was from China. She tried to explain the difference between the People’s Republic of China and the Republic of China, but I could not comprehend how a place could be called China but not be China. The interview ended there, at the first question, with my mother frustrated and me in tears. This past week, reading news accounts and analysis of   Donald Trump’s controversial phone call with Taiwan’s president, Tsai   it was my turn to feel frustrated. Taiwan was discussed primarily as an appendage of U. S.  relations, an irritant in the delicate relationship between two countries. “Bargaining chip” has been a common descriptor of Taiwan’s role. A flood of headlines reorients the attention on China: “Trump’s Phone Call To Taiwan’s Leader Risks China Tensions. ” “Trump’s Taiwan call shows China he’s not a pushover. ” “The Taiwan call was no ‘courtesy’ —  Donald Trump means to wreck US —  China relations. ” A former Asia director at the National Security Council, Evan Medeiros, said of the call, “Trump is setting a foundation of enduring mistrust and strategic competition for   relations. ” Even those who supported the call made it about China. On Twitter, New York Representative Pete King called it a “strong message to China. ”      The Washington Post’s Jia Lynn Yang explains the back story on relations between the U. S. China and Taiwan and the ramifications of Friday’s telephone call between   Donald Trump and Taiwanese President Tsai  . (Alice Li, Victoria   Washington Post)   Even though Trump’s repudiation of diplomatic protocol is troubling, this is a long overdue chance for us to return our attention to Taiwan for Taiwan’s sake and reconsider America’s outdated position on it. When I started working on my novel “Green Island,” set in Taiwan during the second half of the 20th century, I had to wade through the history of words used to describe it. Free China. Chinese Taipei. Republic of China. Taiwan. Reunification. Unification. Province. Country. I have watched the media struggle through this negotiation around language in the past week. In the clamor to parse what China will do, or what this means for America, the perspectives and stories of the people of Taiwan have been ignored. From 1895 to 1945, under the Treaty of Shimonoseki, Taiwan was a colony of Japan, acquired from the Qing Empire. When Japan gave up its colonies at the end of World War II, the Kuomintang (KMT) also known as the Chinese Nationalist Party, which then ruled China, took control. One of Chiang  ’s most successful projects after the KMT occupied Taiwan was revamping the educational system. Not only did the KMT enforce Mandarin language use, but it also replaced Taiwan’s history with China’s. This erasure continued throughout Chiang’s authoritarian regime and over 38 years of martial law. The end of World War II also saw the resumption of the conflict between the Chinese Communist Party and the KMT. Losing the Chinese Civil War, the KMT fled to Taiwan in 1949, establishing the island as its base for the Republic of China with a plan to return and rule China again. There was no “split” but rather a retreat by KMT members and their families, around 2 million people, to Taiwan, where nearly 6 million people already lived. Having recently emerged from 50 years of Japanese colonialism, the Taiwanese encountered considerable friction with the newly arrived Chinese, who had spent eight years fighting the Japanese. This is why words matter when it comes to Taiwan. Much of the coverage describes Taiwan’s history as if it began in 1949. Using words like “split” and “reunification” effaces the history that existed before that. I can’t help but think about what stories get lost. For example, the story of Mona Rudao, chief of the Seediq tribe, one of 16 indigenous groups of Austronesian heritage that have inhabited Taiwan for thousands of years. In 1930, Rudao led an armed resistance against the Japanese colonizers. The Japanese countered with double the forces and mustard gas bombs in such an appalling display of violence that their policies regarding the indigenous population would subsequently be revised. Rudao killed himself to avoid being caught, and his remains were put on display as warning to other   rebels. His image now graces the 20   coin. We lose the story of the painful Japanization movement, during which Taiwan’s people were forced to speak Japanese and take Japanese names. Young men conscripted into the Japanese army paid a “blood tax” by proving their loyalty to Japan with their lives. Young women were forced to serve soldiers as sex slaves. Also gone is the story of the people who wished for   democracy after the Japanese colonists left in 1945, only to have their hopes crushed by the Kuomintang forces. A narrow view of history makes it easier to forget Feb. 28, 1947, when protests began in response to the beating by Tobacco Monopoly Bureau agents of a young widow selling   cigarettes  —   the kind of tragic encounter that surely resonates in contemporary America. The KMT responded with a   massacre in which as many as 30, 000 Taiwanese were murdered or disappeared to suppress resistance to its authority. And it erases the tens of thousands imprisoned and executed during the decades of terror that followed the massacre. For nearly 40 years, the people of Taiwan had barbed wire wrapped around their tongues as they were forbidden to speak of the horrors committed by Chiang and his men. The sorrow of that era still lingers: Martial law ended only in 1987. Claiming that Taiwan’s history begins in 1949 is a second silencing. Finally, we can’t forget that despite this painful history, Taiwan transformed itself into a democracy, with freedom of the press, universal health care and a democratically elected female president. These are achievements of resilience we should recognize and applaud. We can’t change policy in a day, or reinstate recognition of Taiwan with a snap of our fingers (or a phone call) but we can at least do the honest work of understanding the nuances of the history of Taiwan and its people."
142179,217565,Five myths about U.S.-China relations,Washington Post,John Pomfret,2016-12-09,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161211001801/https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/five-myths-about-us-china-relations/2016/12/09/beedb888-bccc-11e6-91ee-1adddfe36cbe_story.html
","  U. S.  relations have never been easy. No problem in the world can be solved without the pair working together, but working together is hard. The relationship is set for more uncertainty with the election of Donald Trump. On Dec. 2, Trump took a call from the democratically elected president of Taiwan, breaking decades of precedent. The call raised fears that Trump would take a hard line on China. But then, unpredictable as ever, the   announced Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad as his pick for ambassador to Beijing. Branstad reportedly has a close personal relationship with Chinese President Xi Jinping. A little good cop, bad cop, perhaps? Anyway, a whole mythology has emerged about the most consequential relationship in the world. Here are a few myths that could use busting.  Myth No. 1 Trade and engagement will set China free. This idea has been a foundational myth of America’s engagement with China almost since President Richard Nixon went there in 1972; it’s been used to justify decades of interaction. On the day China was granted    trading status in Washington in 1980, Rep. Bill Alexander (Ark.) a supporter of President Jimmy Carter, told the House, “Seeds of democracy are growing in China. ” Flash forward to China’s accession to the World Trade Organization in 2001, and Robert Rubin, former treasury secretary under Bill Clinton, assuring Congress that the move would “sow the seeds of freedom for China’s 1. 2 billion citizens. ”  So far, this epochal bet has been a bust. China’s economy has become more open over the past few decades, and personal freedom for average citizens has expanded. But China’s   state represses dissent even more severely than it did 30 years ago in the   to the 1989 crackdown on   protests around Tiananmen Square. A slew of internal Communist Party documents indicates that the level of paranoia about American values encroaching on China is at a crescendo. Meanwhile, Western businesses remain banned from investing in a wide swath of China’s economy, while Chinese firms can often invest in those sectors, including energy and telecommunications, overseas. Myth No. 2 Trump’s Taiwan phone call threatened the status quo. When Trump took Taiwan’s call, the U. S. foreign policy establishment had a minor nervous breakdown. Vox warned of “disarray ” in U. S.  relations. New York magazine raised the specter of a “diplomatic disaster. ”  Let’s take a deep breath and realize that the “status quo” between Taiwan and the United States has been evolving for decades. In exchange for Chinese promises to help ease the United States out of Vietnam and counter the Soviet Union, officials from the Nixon and Carter administrations promised China that America would walk away from Taiwan, allowing China to absorb the island of 23 million people, which Beijing views as a renegade province.  Since then, however, especially as U. S. presidents have come to understand that China’s political system has not moved in a positive direction, successive administrations have worked to better ties with Taiwan. Weapons sales to the island remain robust despite a promise to China in 1982 to slow them. Diplomatic contact has been upgraded. Washington now supports granting Taiwan observer status at a variety of international organizations. Most Taiwanese can come to the United States without a visa. In that sense, Trump’s call was a logical continuation of a slowly evolving process of improved relations. The big concern, however, is that China will use the call as an excuse to further bully Taiwan and that Trump will stand by. Myth No. 3 The United States has tried to contain China’s rise. This is China’s version of Myth 1, and it undergirds Beijing’s official view of the United States. It appears in Chinese history textbooks, is repeated ad nauseam on   media and is used as a throwaway line in everyday interaction between Chinese and Americans. One recent headline on the Chinese government’s news website read, “Containing China: America Has 5 Trump Cards. ” Enough already. Any clearheaded look at the history between the two countries reveals that throughout their interaction, save for a short interregnum during the Cold War, the United States has been, if anything, the prime foreign enabler of China’s rise. America’s open wallets, open society and open universities have been key factors in China’s ascent from a Third World backwater to a global economic power. In 2001, the United States ushered China into the World Trade Organization, contributing to a massive boom in Chinese exports.   scientists man Chinese research institutions, and   technocrats populate its central bank. Sure, Americans have done stupid things to justify Chinese misgivings, such as the wrongheaded push against China’s establishment of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank in 2015. But that is small beer. Of course, the Chinese Communist Party, given its paranoia about American values, cannot publicly recognize this fact. But privately, every party leader since Deng Xiaoping has sent his child to be educated in the United States  —   an acknowledgment that America holds some of the answers to China’s quest to become strong and rich.  Myth No. 4 China is killing the U. S. economy. The notion that China is destined to take over the world was a major theme of this election. “We can’t continue to allow China to rape our country,” Trump told a crowd in May, claiming that the country is “killing” the United States on trade and dominating us on the international market. Trump and many, many others have also argued that China’s holding of about $1 trillion in U. S. debt gives it leverage over everything we do. None of this is really true. First, the U. S. Treasurys market is enormous, totaling about $11 trillion, and highly liquid. China holds about as much in Treasury bonds as Japan does. And if China dumped its holdings, it would hurt China as much as the United States, because a price drop in Treasurys would lower the value of China’s investments. On trade, years of studies have shown that automation is more of a factor than outsourcing to China in the   of U. S. manufacturing jobs. That said, certain sectors of the economy, such as   and textiles, have been hammered by China. As for total competition with the United States, Americans tend to overestimate our problems and underestimate those of our competitors. China is facing a series of looming predicaments: Its corporate debt to GDP ratio is one of the highest in the world; if it’s not dealt with soon, it could cause a financial crisis. Its environmental issues are so extreme that some cities, such as Beijing, which is routinely cloaked in a cocktail of dust and smog, have stopped publishing life expectancy statistics. And finally, China’s demographics, born   of its former   policy  are resulting in a rapidly aging population and higher labor costs. If productivity does not increase substantially, China’s gross domestic product will slow even more. Myth No. 5 China’s   propaganda doesn’t matter. When Henry Kissinger went to China on his historic 1971 trip, he complained to Premier Zhou Enlai about a surge in   propaganda. In a tactic that his successors would repeat, Zhou said the   media was just “firing empty cannons” and assured Kissinger that it did not matter. Wrong. Attacking America did matter to the communists; it was a centerpiece of their ideology. Four decades later, this remains the case. The occasional official has worried about the U. S. tendency to ignore the avalanche of   claptrap in China’s media or our willingness to allow Chinese officials to operate in the United States in ways that run counter to our values. When George H. W. Bush was the head of the U. S. Liaison Office in Beijing in late 1974, the People’s Republic sent its first exhibit of archaeological treasures to the United States. The Chinese informed State Department officials that they would not allow reporters from nations that did not have relations with China to attend a news conference planned for the National Gallery of Art. Instead of ignoring the Chinese demand, the State Department canceled the briefing. Bush was shocked. “We must not capitulate on matters this fundamental,” he wrote. “. . . We must not permit them to flaunt their way in the United States. ” State ignored his entreaties.  America’s unwillingness to demand reciprocity from China on such fronts has harmed the relationship by effectively rewarding Chinese bad behavior, which encourages more. An example would be America’s openness in granting visas to Chinese journalists, and in giving them significant freedom to operate in the United States, while tolerating the deep restrictions China places on American reporters working there. China’s leaders have also become comfortable with publicly lambasting the United States. In October 2014, President Jinping praised   blogger Zhou Xiaoping for spreading what he called “positive energy. ” In a particularly notorious essay titled “Nine Knockout Blows in America’s Cold War Against China,” Zhou had savaged the tendency of young Chinese to worship the West and declared that America was treating China and the Chinese in the same way Hitler had treated the Jews.

142180,217566,Peruvian president to Trump: ‘You are lucky to have Latin America.’,Washington Post,Lally Weymouth,2016-12-09,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161211001801/https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/peruvian-president-to-trump-you-are-lucky-to-have-latin-america/2016/12/09/565c9d90-bd5b-11e6-91ee-1adddfe36cbe_story.html
","   Lally Weymouth is a senior associate editor for The Washington Post.   To say that Pedro Pablo Kuczynski is prepared for his new job as Peru’s president is an understatement. Kuczynski, 78, has been finance minister and prime minister; a technocrat at the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank; an investment banker and founder of a   fund. Last year he relinquished his U. S. citizenship to run for president. A passionate believer in free trade, Kuczynski will square off against   Donald Trump’s protectionist stance while trying to stop a   conflict between mining companies  —   crucial to the nation’s export economy  —   and the local communities where they excavate. He talked with The Washington Post’s Lally Weymouth in Lima. Edited excerpts follow.  Q. You made some caustic remarks about   Donald Trump during your campaign; you even joked that Peru would “grab a saw and cut” off relations with the United States if he won. How will his election affect the region?  A. I’d better tone down what I have been saying. There is a lot of uncertainty, especially with regard to Mexico. Everybody is worried about what is going to happen. The idea of the wall is completely crazy. I just don’t understand how people continue talking about the Mexicans paying for this wall. I hope [his presidency] works out differently than what analysts expect, because the world needs a little peace and tranquility.  Q. You are coming to the U. S. in February?  A. I will come to the U. S. if the Congress here gives me permission. My old school, Princeton, is giving me a medal, which is called the James Madison Medal. If I am there, I will take the Metroliner down to Washington and say hello.  Q. Say hello to the new president?   A. Right. We have had a good relationship with the Obama administration.   Q. The question is, can you work out a good relationship with the new administration?   A. It depends a little bit on what their perception of Latin America is. If they think that Latin America is just a bunch of guys who climb walls to get illegal work, then it is not going to go well. I hope they go past that.   Q. What will you and Donald Trump say to each other when you meet?  A. The first thing I am going to try to explain to him is that the U. S. is not in the dumps because of Mexico. There is hardly any Mexican immigration into the U. S. today. . . . I am going to tell him: “You are lucky you have Latin America. Sure, there are drugs and problems, that’s true. But you have to look on the positive side. We are less uncivilized than you think. We actually make a big contribution to the U. S. We don’t give you any real trouble. Latin immigration to the U. S.  —   sure, it should be done legally  —   makes a pretty positive contribution to the U. S. economy. ” Also, if you look at the actual numbers,   agreements have been pretty positive for the United States. How many car part plants in the Midwest depend on the Mexican market?  Q. At one point in your life, you were the CEO of the Central Bank of Peru. Then the military took over in a coup in 1968.   A. They wanted to know where the reserves were, and they forced me at gunpoint to open the safe. I showed them the few bricks of gold that were there. They said, “But that’s not all the money!” Most of it was at the Federal Reserve Bank in New York. So they did not like me, and eventually they sent me to jail. Ultimately, I fled.  Q. How did you get out of jail?  A. I got out of jail with the help of some friends in the military.   Q. Then you went into the jungle? A. We crossed through northern Peru into Ecuador.  Q. How long did that take?  A. Two or three weeks. We had an air force map and a compass. We got into Ecuador, and we walked and walked. In the end, we found a military base where they came and picked us up. I went back to Washington. I had [previously] worked at the World Bank, but the World Bank didn’t want me because they said I was too political. So I went to the International Monetary Fund.   Q. Your first foreign trip as president was to China. Are you looking to Asia for growth because Trump is threatening trade barriers?  A. China is our biggest market. It is about 22 percent of Peruvian exports  —   mostly metals but also some sophisticated agricultural products. We have no issues with China the way others may have with [its claims in the South China Sea].   Q. You are trying to get the Chinese to invest here?  A. The Chinese have two huge copper mines here. They are looking at several other projects.  Q. If the U. S. opts out of the   Partnership  will China move in and ask TPP countries to join its own Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership?  A. Right. This is a group that will include India, which is important for us because India is the one country we don’t have a trade treaty with. The idea we floated during the recent meeting of the   Economic Cooperation (APEC) is that the Pacific Alliance countries  —   that is Mexico, Colombia, Peru, Chile  —   join the Free Trade Agreement of Asia and the Pacific (FTAAP). Basically, the FTAAP is the APEC countries without the U. S. TPP was more ambitious, but it also had its detractors. It didn’t include China, which is the bigger player in the Pacific. Also on pharmaceuticals, the period of tests would have gone from five to 10 years, which might have raised the cost of pharmaceuticals in countries like Peru. So there was some opposition to it. A lot of the business people here love TPP.   Q. How about yourself?  A. I don’t love TPP so much. China is our biggest customer. So how can we support something that excludes them?   Q. You have a large informal economy.  A. It is about 40 percent of the economy and about 65 percent of the employment. If the businesses become legal, they will pay social security for their workers, and we will fill up the coffers of the pension funds a little bit. We will go down from an informal economy of 65 percent to 45 percent or 40 percent by the end of my government. If we are able to reach numbers like that, there will be a credit revolution here. The minute you become formal, you can borrow. So that will give us a big boost in growth without relying entirely on metals prices. We want to grow between 5 and 6 percent a year.  Q. Won’t you also have to enact labor reforms so that employers can fire employees?   A. The constitutional court has said that you can fire people, but they have to stay in the company. We have to change that.  Q. How?  A. You appoint better people to the court. It is not like the U. S. Supreme Court where you stay until you die. Here you stay six years and then you’re out.  Q. Several mines have been shut down over the past three administrations, and the situation is reportedly getting worse between the mine owners and the locals. What are you going to do to resolve these conflicts? A. I am going in a few days to the Tia Maria mining district in the south on the coast to talk to folks there because they oppose the mine.   Q. You yourself are going? A. I will sit in the town square. There is no water for irrigation because there is a drought, and people are ticked off, so we are building them a well. In the end, a lot of these mining conflicts boil down to water. The president has to be involved.   Q. Do you have to be tough?  A. You have to have an iron hand in a silken glove. You cannot start firing at people.  Q. It seems as if all the past presidents gave up  —    A. I’m not like past presidents. None of them actually went to talk to the miners. I come from the mining industry. I used to run one of Alcoa’s biggest mines.   Q. What do you plan to do about drug trafficking in your country, which is the   cocaine producer in the world?  A. We have done quite a bit. We have started to clean up the police. We had over 80 generals in the police force; 40 were fired. We have also dismissed 1, 000 police officers. The main thing we have to do with drugs is to give the people in the Valle de los Ríos Apurímac region  —   that’s the major drug area  —   alternatives. They have to have roads, schools, electricity and jobs.   Q. How do you see the situation in Venezuela?  A. Totally terrible. [President Nicolás] Maduro is afraid that if he yields, they will hang him from a lamppost, so he wants to stick with it. There are many rumors that the army is heavily involved in drug trafficking. . . . We have to begin thinking about it before it explodes. First of all, you should have major humanitarian relief, which Maduro doesn’t want. Second, you should have a transitional government for a year. Then you can have new elections once the boat is steady again.  Twitter: @LallyWeymouth   Read more from Outlook and follow our updates on Facebook and Twitter.  "
142181,217567,Let’s get the facts right on foreign involvement in our elections,Washington Post,Michael McFaul,2016-12-10,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161211001801/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/global-opinions/wp/2016/12/10/lets-get-the-facts-right-on-foreign-involvement-in-our-elections/
","       Donald Trump won the 2016 presidential election and will be the next president of the United States. As I have written before in these pages, the rules of the game for choosing our presidents need to be changed, but that discussion concerns future elections, not this past one. A win is a win.  That most people acknowledge Trump’s victory should now free us to have a serious discussion about the role of foreign interference in the 2016 presidential election. During the campaign, mentions of foreign meddling quickly became partisan and polarized, blocking any real examination of the facts, let alone a discussion of prescriptions. Even Obama administration officials seemed to tiptoe around these issues, not wanting to appear to use their privileged access to classified information to help the Democratic Party’s candidate, Hillary Clinton. But now the election is over. Before the next one, we need to know the facts  —   investigate what did and did not occur  —   so that we can develop procedures, policies and laws to strengthen the integrity of our electoral process before 2020. This is not a partisan plea; it is a national security issue. We know some facts, and they are disturbing. For instance, we know that Russian actors stole data from people working at the Democratic National Committee. We know that another foreign actor, WikiLeaks, published data stolen from the DNC to adversely affect Clinton. We also know that WikiLeaks and others published data stolen from John Podesta, Clinton’s campaign chairman, in order to try to damage further the Democratic candidate. We also know that WikiLeaks did not publish similar kinds of data from the Trump campaign or the Republican Party. We do not know precisely if the Russian government or its intermediaries transferred the data they stole to WikiLeaks. We do not know with certainty if the Russian government (or any other actor) stole data from Trump and the Republican Party but chose not to release it to WikiLeaks. We do not know if WikiLeaks had obtained data on Trump and the Republican Party but made an editorial decision not to release this information. I don’t know, but we need to know. We also know that Russian hackers were probing computers that contained information on voter registration, and poking around at actual voting machines and tabulators. Thankfully, this clear Russian capacity to disrupt Election Day activities, including vote counting, does not seem to have led to actions influencing the election outcome. But what about the future? National popular votes are less vulnerable to hackers because manipulating millions of votes without detection is difficult. But our electoral college system makes us more susceptible to tampering, because simply   a small fraction of votes in a few targeted precincts of a few key states can change the electoral outcome. Despite our federal, decentralized system of voting, can we nonetheless implement measures to prevent voting fraud in 2020, when technologies to manipulate voting data will have improved? I don’t know, but we need to know. And what about the capacity of other actors, both foreign and domestic? Will they now be more tempted to engage in voter manipulation in 2020? Are there policies and negotiations that, if started now, could prevent such actions by 2020? Should there be international norms about regulating such behavior, as disrupters have made clear their intention to intervene in future European elections? We need to know. In addition, we know that    “media” outlets such as RT and Sputnik campaigned openly for one candidate, Donald Trump. Sputnik even tweeted the hashtag #CrookedHillary. We have laws preventing foreign governments from contributing financial support to candidates. Should we have similar laws about   support? Such regulation seems hard, in tension with our First Amendment, but shouldn’t our lawmakers wrestle with the issue? Should Sputnik and RT employees be accredited as journalists or as foreign agents under the Foreign Agents Registration Act? I don’t know. But we need to know. Stories also have circulated about Russian and other foreign actors involved in the production of fake news, as well as collaboration between Russian (and other foreign) and American leaders and movements regarding common political agendas, that is, a new “Illiberal International” to replace the old Communist International. What was the full scope of these activities? Did any of these actions influence the election outcome? I don’t know, but we need to know. The Obama administration just announced that it plans to conduct an investigation of Russian cybertheft during the 2016 election. That is a good start (although let’s hope this investigation started long before now!) but it is not enough. First, a serious investigation will take longer than one month; second, the authors of such a report must be bipartisan; third, the scope of such an inquiry must include other forms of interference beyond hacking; and fourth, the actions (and maybe  ) of the executive branch during the 2016 campaign must be part of the study. The only way to generate comprehensive answers to these questions and many more concerning the integrity of our electoral system is for Congress to authorize and support a bipartisan investigation, staffed in part by academics and experts, so that we know better what happened and therefore can make important policy changes before the 2020 elections. Such an investigative commission is exactly what Reps. Elijah E. Cummings ( .) and Eric Swalwell ( .) proposed this week in their new bill, the Protecting Our Democracy Act, which would establish “the National Commission on Foreign Interference in the 2016 Election. ” Ideally, the act could be expanded to include H. R. 5181, the Countering Foreign Propaganda and Disinformation Act of 2016, as these issues must be analyzed and addressed together, and not treated separately. All Americans  —   Republican, Democrat and other  —   should want free and fair elections. We must diagnose the problem, including dispelling possible myths about the extent of the problem, before recommending prescriptions. Establishing this commission is an excellent bipartisan step toward preserving this most sacred American value."
142182,217568,Democrats search for a path back into rural America’s good graces,Washington Post,Dan Balz,2016-12-10,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161211001801/https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/democrats-search-for-a-path-back-into-rural-americas-good-graces/2016/12/10/8bc92fea-bef8-11e6-ae79-bec72d34f8c9_story.html
","  MADISON  —   Democrats continue to digest last month’s election results and probably will do so for months to come. The devastation of losing a presidential contest most Democrats thought they would win has been compounded by the decimation of the party at all levels that has occurred since President Obama was first elected. Advisers to Hillary Clinton have noted, correctly, that in an election that turned on a relatively few number of votes in a handful of northern industrial states, there are many possible answers, all with some validity, for why she lost. They range from strategic or tactical mistakes by Clinton’s campaign to Clinton’s weaknesses as a candidate to the resistance to a female candidate for president among some voters to   Donald Trump’s shrewdly opportunistic campaign to nefarious activity by the Russians. The Obama administration will seek to understand more about the role the Russians played in the U. S. election even as Trump tries to bat away information suggesting that he benefited from foreign intrusion. Knowing more about exactly what the Russians did is of critical importance. But Democrats ought not to believe that their problems have been caused primarily by the actions of a foreign government. There’s too much other evidence that they have lost touch with parts of the electorate and will need to take stock as they begin to try to regain ground. As much as anything, the 2016 election highlighted the degree to which Democrats have lost favor among voters in rural and   America. Heading toward Election Day, Democrats dismissed the possibility that there were enough white,   voters in these nonurban areas to overcome their advantages with African Americans, Latinos, unmarried women and highly educated voters. The election proved them wrong. Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania broke the back of the Clinton campaign, but her margins of defeat were even larger in neighboring Ohio and Iowa. The pattern of Trump’s vote in these states shows how effective his crosscutting message proved to be in the final weeks of the campaign and the degree of resistance to the Democrats’ message. Wisconsin has seen close elections in the past. George W. Bush lost the state by less than a point in both 2000 and 2004. Obama won it by almost 14 points in 2008 and by about seven points in 2012. Trump won the state by   of a percentage point.  Craig Gilbert of the Milwaukee   recently provided the first groundbreaking analysis of how Wisconsin voted. What he found was an uneven pattern, with Trump significantly outperforming Mitt Romney in some areas and underperforming in others. Trump did worse in areas of greater affluence and higher levels of education, particularly around Milwaukee. But he did dramatically better in smaller,   communities.  As Gilbert wrote, “He [Trump] won more than 500 cities, towns and villages that voted for Obama in 2012. He won 190 of them by at least 20 points. These ‘  communities’ were located overwhelmingly in northern, western and central Wisconsin. Their median population was less than 800. ” Gilbert added that Trump’s gains in these smaller communities were so dramatic that he overcame the deficiencies around Milwaukee. “If you add up all the communities in Wisconsin of less than 2, 000 people,” he wrote, “Trump won them collectively by 24 points and nearly 150, 000 votes. Romney won those same communities by 4 points and fewer than 30, 000 votes. ” Ohio turned out not to be close in 2016, in large part because a similar pattern turned a historically competitive battleground into a rout for the Republican nominee. Trump won Ohio by eight points, compared with a   victory by Obama in 2012. An analysis by Mike Dawson, an expert on Ohio election statistics, showed that Trump’s margin was at least 10 points better than Romney’s in 41 of the state’s 88 counties. Overall, he ran about even with Romney in two counties and behind in just four counties, including Franklin (Columbus) Hamilton (Cincinnati) and Delaware (suburban Columbus). Trump’s biggest gains came in Ohio’s Appalachian counties, where he ran 12 points ahead of Romney. David Pepper, the Ohio Democratic chair, said Trump’s message on trade penetrated in communities that went into decline years ago, some of which had consistently voted Democratic in presidential races. “His message was so clear he tapped into something that was bigger than the Republican Party,” Pepper said. “It’s why swing counties went red and why red counties went redder and blue counties were not as good [for Clinton] as they needed to be. ”  Democrats have sometimes assumed that they don’t need to do much to appeal to voters in these communities, assuming that they represent a shrinking portion of the electorate. Today they are wondering how they can appeal to them more effectively. On Friday, the University of Wisconsin’s Elections Research Center held a symposium analyzing the 2016 election. Among the many thoughtful presenters was Katherine Cramer, a   professor at the university’s Madison campus.  Cramer spent years traveling to small Wisconsin towns, talking with citizens about politics, government and other topics. The research produced a book, published earlier this year, called “The Politics of Resentment: Rural Consciousness in Wisconsin and the rise of Scott Walker. ”  Not surprisingly, Cramer has been in high demand as journalists and others seek to better understand Trump’s success in appealing to voters in these parts of the country. During her presentation Friday, she was asked what Democrats could do to reach these voters. As the questioner put it, what could the Democrats to do speak to these voters more directly? “I would say it’s not speaking to people,” she said. If Democrats want to do better with these voters, she said, it would require spending time with them and asking them what’s on their minds and then listening to their answers. Only then can they try to deliver a message. “There’s so much respect that has to be conveyed to people before they start listening to the message,” she added. When another person asked why some people seem to vote against their own interests, Cramer again turned the question around. “I’m not claiming people are voting against their own interest,” she said. “We have to be careful about how we define what people’s interests are. . . . The trick is to think about what policies can you offer that people in those positions perceive as in their own interest. ” Cramer noted that the people with whom she has been interacting for nearly a decade were particularly drawn to two elements of Trump’s message. Because they feel disrespected by the urban areas of the state and feel disconnected from government, Trump’s message of division  —   whether “birtherism” or “build the wall”  —   resonated, as did his call for dramatic change  —   his message to “drain the swamp. ” She also said that her   interviews in some of these communities revealed a significant lack of confidence that Trump would actually change the lives of people living there. That’s the challenge ahead for the   as he takes office. There are no easy policy ideas to revitalize the economies of these communities. For the Democrats, it’s a bigger challenge of trying to gain back a share of those voters, in part because they represented the margin of defeat in 2016. The party historically has stood for working people but has seen that connection eroded, if not shattered. As Cramer suggested, there will be no quick fixes for the Democrats on that question. "
142183,217569,MGM casino outside Washington may change Washington’s ways,Washington Post,Michael Laris,2016-12-10,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161211001801/https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/trafficandcommuting/mgm-casino-outside-washington-may-change-washingtons-ways/2016/12/10/f2d00852-bd82-11e6-91ee-1adddfe36cbe_story.html
"," MGM’s new casino sits seven miles south of the White House and is filled with hat tips and homages to life in the nation’s capital. George Washington’s dignified   mug is plastered outside   toilets. One bar is meant to evoke the National Archives. Another, the Blossom lounge, has hanging pink lights shaped like the area’s iconic cherry trees. There are even shameless land grabs, as with the marketing of the MGM National Harbor’s showy Chairman Suite. “These are the 3, 210 most coveted square feet in Washington,” the booking site reads breathlessly. But this is not Washington. The new resort sits down a clogged highway where the Capital Beltway and the Potomac River meet in suburban Maryland’s Prince George’s County.  And that Copperfieldian bit of geographic   is at the heart of the entire enterprise. The way people navigate that tension across the   line  —   and beyond  —   will help determine whether this glitzy new neighbor succeeds, and what lasting imprint it leaves.  The $1. 4 billion casino complex has the potential to do two things. It may prove to be the economic boon its boosters have promised the county of 900, 000. It could also change the rituals of Washington’s K Street lobbying set, adding slot machines, craps and poker to the   meals and other perks in the power broker’s tool kit.    Dealer Stacie Bradford deals the very first poker game at MGM National Harbor on opening night. (Sarah L.   Washington Post)  As thousands of inaugural customers stormed the new resort in its opening days, at times pressing against burly human barricades and the pure physics of local roads, there were signs Washington was getting drawn in.  Standing beneath a gleaming sculpture of Ben Franklin and Chinese strongman Mao Zedong leaping out of their respective currencies for a boxing match, attorney Jay Halpern of Potomac, Md. tried to project the casino’s future. “It will be interesting to see, 10 years from now, what history says this was like,” Halpern said. “It’s either going to be a phenomenal success or ‘What was that thing?’ ” Halpern put MGM National Harbor on a probation of sorts before walking through its glass doors. He had purchased seats in the resort’s intimate theater for next year  —   a tribute to ’60s and ’70s rockers The Band  —   but was willing to dump them on StubHub if he wasn’t impressed. Now he and his wife, ghost blogger Amy Halpern, were describing the joys of José Andrés’s tuna tartare and said they are psyched to return for an overnight stay. His prediction? “This will be good to great. It’s not going to be the Atlantic City debacle,” Halpern said. “It’s nothing like the rest of Washington,” Amy Halpern said. “This is Vegas on the Potomac. ” These were the words Patrick Fisher, an ebullient MGM hotel executive who went to high school in Prince George’s, had risked his future to hear. “This is going to be the showpiece  —   the shining light  —   for all of D. C.,” Fisher said. He left a job at the   downtown for the chance at MGM. “This is where I saw myself for the next 50 years. . . . We’re going to provide an elevated level of service that’s never been seen in this region. ”  His   competition largely gave the new kid a pass on rhetorical excess. Liliana Baldassari, director of public relations for the Four Seasons in Georgetown, said she welcomed MGM’s new casino and shows and understands the imperatives behind the posturing, particularly for visitors from afar. “They need to present themselves as part of Washington, D. C. because nobody knows about National Harbor,” Baldassari said. As for as accommodations, “we’ve been open for 37 years. The level of luxury you get here is the top in the city. ” MGM, with its “This is Monumental” tagline, has also been advertising on billboards at Verizon Center, seeking to reach those wallets. Might   and their clients prefer to see Bruno Mars up close at MGM’s   theater rather than Verizon’s   arena? A spokeswoman for Verizon’s owner, Monumental Sports & Entertainment, insisted that MGM’s arrival is a “  for the area,” since it offers “a whole new spectrum of entertainment offerings” and will just “add to the many reasons” people visit.  Prince George’s has hungered for a   entertainment venue, but also a bigger role in the collective consciousness of Washington. “I believe in this county,” said artist Margaret Boozer. She spent the last year building a piece of wall art from 10, 000 pounds of clay dug out of the MGM construction site and hauled in a Ryder truck to her Mount Rainier studio. The topographical relief was inspired, in part, by regional maps from the 1800s and now fills a lobby wall in the hotel. “How people refer to it indicates what kind of conversation they’re rally wanting to have. I think people who say ‘Washington’ are trying to have a more national or international discussion,” Boozer said. “But those of us who live here have real pride in our home. And we want to claim it as ours. ” Still, some are wary.  At the MGM, bartenders have cooked up a $14 cocktail dubbed the “Congress Heights,” which features Dominican rum, lime, mint, spiced cranberry syrup, seltzer and orange bitters. On a corner in Congress Heights, the view is less sweet.  “This is a K2 neighborhood,” said Will Bonnette, standing on a stretch of District sidewalk where a flood of synthetic marijuana and an   PCP market have fueled addiction. As he peered down a commercial strip shared by drunk pedestrians, parents picking up their kids from day care and a towering mural of Martin Luther King Jr. a young pregnant woman walked up and begged him for $2. Bonnette, who lives in Prince George’s and directs a   and   program that serves Congress Heights, called it “absolutely insensitive” and a “mockery” to name a drink after a place with “some of the poorest outcomes in regards to health care, employment and social justice. ”  (There is also a   “Foggy Bottom” and   “Potomac Sunset. ”) And he fears the excesses some associate with Las Vegas  —   “in other words, sex and drugs”  —   will bring people down in struggling District and Maryland neighborhoods. “They really don’t have our best interests in mind at all,” Bonnette said.  But the economic arguments resonate with many. “It’ll open more jobs for people. That’s an   for P. G. County for sure,” said Troy Ray, who lives in Oxon Hill, a few minutes from the casino. Tyrone Whitby says what matters is someone believed in “Gorgeous Prince George’s,” and companies and people will follow. “It attracts people who don’t have a clue about Prince George’s. We’re getting worldwide recognition this county would have never gotten before,” said Whitby, a District resident who works in Prince George’s real estate. But recognition and a development coup won’t necessarily result in a transformation. Take the Landover area in Prince George’s, where the Capital Centre hosted the   Bullets before the NBA team moved to the District. Just before the   arena was torn down in 2002 to make way for a development that would bring a Chuck E. Cheese, one official found a parable of sorts. “I saw the great Muhammad Ali fight Holmes here. It was one of the sad times in my life,” said former county executive Jack B. Johnson. “Muhammad Ali lost that fight. You could see the decline of Muhammad Ali and his fighting, just like we saw this building age. All of us age and have to move on. And something new has to come in. ” County Executive Rushern L. Baker III (D) a former slots opponent, calls MGM’s launch “a watershed moment. ”  Many doubt whether gambling’s thrills  —   with the “Breaking Bad” slots and   dealers and hundreds of millions in revenue  —   can really reorder much about Washington. “There will be some action around their craps tables and stuff,” said Frank Smith, a former D. C. Council member, but “the real action is still here. ” Smith heads the African American Civil War Museum in the city’s historic U Street area, a booming neighborhood once ravaged by riots. He hopes to lure MGM’s customers. Washington is the “epitome of American democracy. This is where it all happens,” Smith said. “If you want the real thing, you still have to cross the border. ” Still, for gambling regulars, the MGM National Harbor’s pull is strong.  “I’ll start out with $500,” said James Pittman, an overnight Metro track worker who lives in Bowie and took a vacation day to see the casino up close. He was daunted by overflow crowds but was impressed with the freshness, including new craps tables.  “It’s so spongy, the dice are bouncing around real easy,” Pittman said. “This is   entertainment you don’t have in the area. This fits right in with the buildup of D. C. ” Michele Fisher runs a cat resort in Falls Church, Va. with an old friend from Texas, Angie Boggs. They gamble together weekly and were each feeding twenties into the Playboy Platinum slots. Fisher put in $40 and kept tapping the button with her sparkly red thumbnail. She cashed out at $200. Boggs lost $60.  “This is our fun time. This is what we do,” Fisher said. “Don’t make us sound sad. It’s actually not. ” Peering at a sparkling, multistory Christmas set piece soaring toward a glass ceiling, retiree Aurelia Marshall was awestruck.  She had come to celebrate life with two friends who helped her manage her mother’s   decline and dementia before her passing. “Oh my God! I’ve never seen anything so beautiful,” said Marshall, who worked logistics at a naval ordnance facility in Indian Head, in nearby Charles County. “I’m 69 years old. I’m so glad I’ve lived long enough to see this. ” Baccarat is a nice escape after some tough times.  “Now I can live my life and have a little bit of fun,” Marshall said. "

","  ISTANBUL  —   A car packed with explosives detonated Saturday night at the entrance of a soccer stadium in central Istanbul, authorities said, injuring about 20 people and sending a plume of smoke over the city in the latest in a string of terrorist attacks in the country.  The bomb, which could be heard across Istanbul, exploded outside the Vodafone Arena in the Beskitas area of Istanbul, less than a mile from the city’s bustling Taksim Square and on the edge of the Bosporus.  Turkey has been hit by multiple terrorist attacks in recent years, including from both the Islamic State and Kurdish militants waging a war for autonomy. In June, suspected Islamic State operatives staged an assault on Istanbul’s Ataturk Airport, killing nearly 50 people. Militants have also carried out deadly attacks in the capital, Ankara, and other Turkish cities.  Saturday’s blast detonated near a group of riot police who were posted at the stadium following a soccer match earlier in the evening, the Interior Ministry said in a statement. The area is normally packed with fans and other traffic on weekend nights.  Fires set off by the blast burned around the stadium, according to footage aired on local news channels, and ambulances were seen rushing to ferry the wounded.  One of the teams that had played earlier that night, Bursaspor, said on its official Twitter account that none of its fans had been injured in the bomb, which produced a massive, orange fireball and shook doors and windows in Turkey’s largest city.  A video of a news conference at the stadium showed the moment of the blast, which sent people running. Another video circulated online showed the fiery explosion in the background of two young men playing guitar on the Bosporus.  Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu said there was “no information” on the number of fatalities, but that the roughly 20 wounded were identified as police.  Turkey has been roiled by political instability, including a failed coup attempt against the government this summer. A widespread crackdown on suspected coup plotters has also snagged dissidents and opposition figures, including ethnic Kurdish politicians.    "

","     A member of Congress who served as a Marine in Iraq said he has been called “everything you can under the sun” by fellow veterans for his decision to oppose retired Marine Gen. James N. Mattis becoming defense secretary, but he stands by his choice. Rep. Ruben Gallego (D. .) who became a congressman last year, said he has been insulted repeatedly by fellow combat veterans, with some inaccurately calling him “POG,” a derisive acronym that stands for “person other than grunt” and implies he did not serve in the infantry. Others called him a “Blue Falcon,” a term describing someone who turns on a friend for their own personal gain. “Marines in general are the harshest critics of other Marines,” Gallego said, adding that he doesn’t take it personally. “I’ve been told what I can do with different parts of my body orifices to myself. ” A sampling of the negative reaction:   @RepRubenGallego You’re a pog posing as warrior.

If you spent any time anywhere you’d know he’s best.  —   Chris (@chrisdillon808) December 6, 2016   Gallego, whose district includes Phoenix, announced Dec. 5 that he was opposing   Donald Trump’s nomination of Mattis as defense secretary because he believes “strongly in the principle of civilian leadership of the military. ” He is one of the only members of Congress to come out openly against Mattis running the Pentagon. “As a fellow Marine, I greatly admire Gen. James Mattis’s dedication and leadership. We all should be incredibly grateful for his many years of service to our nation,” Gallego said. “Current law requires that a military officer be out of active duty for at least seven years before taking the job of defense secretary. I do not believe this   check should be cast aside, and I will oppose a waiver of this rule, even for someone as exceptionally qualified as Gen. Mattis. ”      Retired U. S. Marine Corps General James Mattis has been chosen to be secretary of defense by   Donald Trump, according to people familiar with the decision. (Jenny   Washington Post)   Gallego served in combat as a mortar man and left the military as an enlisted corporal. He deployed in 2005 with Lima Company, 3rd Battalion, 25th Marines, a reserve unit from Columbus, Ohio, that suffered an unusually high number of fatalities, even for the height of the Iraq War.   of the 180 men in the company were killed.    Ruben Gallego in Iraq in 2005. (Courtesy of the office of Ruben Gallego)  One exception has been granted to the law Congress put in place in 1947: Army Gen. George C. Marshall, a widely admired figure who led the Army during World War II and was called upon by President Truman in 1950. Lawmakers passed legislation allowing Marshall to take the job, but the bill said it was the intention of Congress that a similar move would not happen again. When Marshall took over in September 1950, U. S. forces had suffered a string of defeats in the Korean War and Truman saw him as uniquely suited to restoring morale and rebuilding the military. Gallego said that, like Marshall, Mattis is widely respected, but allowing him to serve as Pentagon chief sets a new, dangerous precedent. “There are some generals who are very good, and there are some generals that are basically loony tunes,” Gallego said. “If we are just automatically going to do these kinds of waivers without serious discussions and understanding the implications to civilian control of the military and the tradition of civilian control of the military, I think we’re doing a grave disservice  —   a grave disservice  —   to our job as members of Congress. ” Gallego said he would “love” to see Mattis in another role in government, including national security adviser. But U. S. citizens also need to have a discussion about how many retired generals they want to have running the federal government, he said. In addition to Mattis, Trump has selected retired Marine Gen. John F. Kelly to run the Department of Homeland Security, retired Army Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn as national security adviser and met with Army Gen. David Petraeus and Navy Adm. James Stavridis. Related stories: James Mattis isn’t just a popular general anymore.

","     As Syrian fighters push toward the Islamic State’s   capital of Raqqa in northern Syria, Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter announced Saturday that additional U. S. Special Operations forces will head into the country to help the fledgling offensive. The additional 200 troops will bolster the 300 or so already in the country, although the number is likely to fluctuate as forces move between Syria and neighboring Iraq. Carter, speaking at a conference in Bahrain, said the forces would include trainers, advisers and explosives specialists. Other western countries, such as France, also have Special Operations units in the country.  “The increase is tied to the growing number of local forces now willing to participate in this fight, and our efforts to enable them,” a senior defense official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss troop deployments, said in an email before Carter’s remarks. It is unclear which particular U. S. Special Operations forces are operating in Syria, however the bulk of the U. S. troops in Syria are probably Army Special Forces from Fifth Special Forces Group along with a mixture of Air Force forward air controllers and other Special Operations units. Fifth Group’s primary area of responsibility is the Middle East and North Africa, and it has helped train Syrian fighters in the past. The unit was the first conventional military force to enter Afghanistan after the   attacks. Last month, Navy Senior Chief Petty Officer Scott Dayton, an explosive ordnance disposal technician, was killed by a roadside bomb northwest of Raqqa. A tribute to Dayton posted on Facebook identified him as being part of Fifth Group in Syria. His attachment to the unit was confirmed by a U. S. military official familiar with the matter. A recent article in the Washington Times also pointed to some members of Fifth Group that are growing increasingly frustrated toward their   for their propensity to micromanage from afar. In an email to the Times, Fifth Group’s commander, Col. Kevin C. Leahy addressed the complaint, saying his troops were right to say their mission is “top heavy” with support personnel. “There is a sizable amount of people required to provide intel, fires, logistics and vetting of   liaison with host nation partners, U. S. country teams, etc. ,” Leahy said in the email. “The teams really are the tip of an inverse triangle of  [headquarters] needed to enable the mission. ” [Obama outlines plans to expand U. S. Special Operations forces in Syria] In May, after images on social media of U. S. Special Operations forces in Syria wearing Kurdish patches surfaced, the Pentagon made the troops remove them to avoid angering Turkey. Special Forces, or Green Berets, specialize in training and advising local forces, a mission known as Foreign Internal Defense, or FID. Images sporadically posted online from local media and individuals on the ground often show what appear to be American forces driving in suburbans and pickup trucks alongside their Syrian counterparts, easily identifiable by their equipment and camouflage patterns. These troops are “training, advising and assisting,” according to the Pentagon, a line that is often emphasized to reiterate that Americans are not on the front lines fighting the Islamic State and are instead guiding local troops. This approach often runs contrary to how U. S. forces have advised in the past, such as in Iraq, Afghanistan and Vietnam, where U. S. troops would operate directly alongside those who they had been tasked to advise. Despite the Pentagon’s insistence, footage routinely appears of U. S. troops on or near the front guiding airstrikes. In some cases, it is clear that U. S. Special Operation forces are using specific antitank weapons to take out approaching   suicide vehicles.  The newest tranche of Special Operations forces headed to Syria represents the third time since October 2015 that the Pentagon has committed more troops there. The initial deployment was billed as a small group of about 50 that would look for local forces that could potentially fight the Islamic State. The second deployment, announced in April, was for 250 troops that would partner with the forces identified and initially assisted by the first detachment. Now, with approximately 500 of the elite forces in Syria, it means U. S. forces will be able to better manage the local forces they are embedded with, meaning troop movements probably will go smoother, and targeting for airstrikes could occur in more places than before. The local forces fighting alongside the Americans and other western troops are an amalgamation of Kurdish and Arab fighters known as the Syrian Democratic Forces, or SDF. From its inception in late 2015, the SDF has primarily comprised Kurdish People’s Protection Units, or YPG. The SDF’s predominantly Kurdish composition has been worrying for neighboring Turkey, who sees the YPG as being directly aligned with the Kurdistan Workers’ Party, or PKK  —   which is recognized by both the United States and Turkey as a terrorist group. Recruiting and training Arab fighters into the SDF has been one of the top priorities for U. S. forces, as taking back Raqqa from the Islamic State with a mostly Kurdish force could be potentially problematic to the city’s residents and Turkey.   Syrian fighters, along with Turkish troops, are also fighting in Syria, but they are concentrated to the west around the town of  .

","  BALTIMORE  —   For the first time in 15 years, Navy was first to sing its alma mater after its game against Army. That gloomy distinction falls to the loser of one of college football’s most storied rivalries, one the Midshipmen had owned since installing the   offense. But that typically efficient rushing attack hardly got on track Saturday afternoon at M&T Bank Stadium, with Navy pinning its fortunes upon a quarterback making the first start of his career. Zach Abey found himself in that uncomfortable circumstance because of injuries to both players who had started the season ahead of him, and the sophomore initially played as if overwhelmed.  By the time the final whistle sounded in a     loss, Abey had thrown two interceptions, both in the first half, and Navy’s   winning streak over Army, a series record, had ended. The Midshipmen committed three turnovers in all, after just nine through their first 11 games.  “I take a lot of responsibility for the game,” Abey said. “Obviously in the first half I made some bad decisions. I feel horrible for the seniors because I told them before the game that I would give it my all for them. ”    “It feels good to be part of the team that kind of put that to an end,” Army Coach Jeff Monken, center, said of the streak. (Toni L.   Washington Post)  Abey settled in somewhat in the second half, finishing with 73 yards and two touchdowns on 19 carries and completing 6 of 10 passes for 89 yards. He didn’t receive much help from his teammates, as the Midshipmen amassed just 201 yards of total offense. Navy ( ) even tried an offensive tweak, using the read option at times, but it mattered little. In front of an announced sellout crowd of 71, 600, Army scored the decisive points on quarterback Ahmad Bradshaw’s   run with six minutes left in the game, capping a   drive that began at the Black Knights’   line. The series included officials overturning a   call on third and seven, leaving Army with a fourth and one from the Midshipmen 18.  But sophomore fullback Andy Davidson’s   run emphatically restored the lost first down, and Bradshaw scored two plays later.   Army ( ) amassed 351 yards of total offense, including 316 rushing, and finished with a   advantage in first downs. It also owned a considerable margin in time of possession, 40:32 to 19:28.  Navy went three plays and punted on its final drive, and the Black Knights ran out the remaining 4:07, triggering a celebration in which the entire corps of cadets spilled onto the field. “We heard for a long time here at West Point about the streak and all that,” said Army Coach Jeff Monken, who once coached on the other sideline as a Navy assistant. “It feels good to be part of the team that kind of put that to an end. ”        Donald Trump attended the annual   football game and watched each half from different sides of the field. (Reuters)   Navy, meanwhile, dropped consecutive games for the first time since 2014. The Midshipmen lost to Temple,   last week in the American Athletic Conference championship game at   Corps Memorial Stadium. In that game, quarterback Will Worth broke a bone in his right foot early in the second quarter, forcing him to the sideline for the rest of the season. The senior had rushed for 25 touchdowns to lead major college football after taking over for original starter Tago Smith, who tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee in the opener. The Midshipmen were able to make the proceedings competitive following intermission despite a rash of injuries on top of Worth’s absence. Also out were starting slotback and senior   Toneo Gulley, who hurt his left foot against the Owls. Slotback Darryl Bonner was held out as well because of concussion protocol.  The defense already was without three starting linebackers, most notably senior   Daniel Gonzales (Lisfranc injury) and starting cornerback Elijah Merchant (concussion protocol).  “We knew coming into the conference if we played in the championship game, we would only have a week to prepare” for Army, said Navy Coach Ken Niumatalolo, who had won his first eight in a row in the series. “You don’t expect that many guys hurt. We’re not going to use that as an excuse. They outplayed us. ” The Midshipmen had overcome a   deficit to take their first lead,   on Abey’s   run with 12:42 to go in the fourth quarter. Abey broke several tackles to get beyond the line of scrimmage and finally another that allowed him to dive across the goal line. Abey had delivered the Midshipmen their first points on a   run with 11:23 left in the third quarter, trimming the margin to   after taking advantage of a fumble recovery at the Army 29. Navy was able to keep the possession going when, on third and five, Abey completed a short throw to Shawn White that the fullback turned into a   gain.  The Midshipmen got within   on Bennett Moehring’s   field goal with 3:59 to go in the third quarter. The series included a fumble recovered by Army that wound up being overturned upon video review, giving the Midshipmen possession at the Black Knights’ 11. Army had a   lead at halftime, courtesy of Davidson’s   run with 7:12 to go in the second quarter. It was Navy’s largest halftime deficit to the Black Knights since 1947. “This game doesn’t change the way I feel about our team or our program,” Niumatalolo said. “We’ll just keep pressing forward. ” "

","     For the second year in a row, Disney is poised to have another ”Star Wars” megahit on its hands with the company on track to sell $130 million in U. S.   tickets for next week’s ”Rogue One.” But no matter how well it performs at the box office, the film’s success may be overshadowed by Disney investors’ rising alarm about another part of the Magic Kingdom: ESPN, which is shedding viewers in record numbers. ESPN was thrust into the spotlight in November when the ratings company Nielsen predicted the sports juggernaut would lose 621, 000 cable subscribers that month. Nielsen estimated the sports network would lose another 555, 000 subscribers in December. The staggering losses have led to calls by analysts for Disney to spin off or sell the beleaguered network, which has lost 9 million subscribers in three years, according to company filings. The challenges ahead are not unique to ESPN. The   industry as a whole has seen many consumers trim back their cable subscriptions in favor of online video services  —   or, fed up with the rising cost of TV, forgo cable altogether.      With streaming TV options becoming more affordable, it may be time to cancel your cable service. But which streaming services offer which channels, and how do you know if you’ll save money in the long run? (Jhaan   Washington Post)   ”There’s an underlying theme of the bundle being the problem,” said Gene Kimmelman, president of the consumer advocacy group Public Knowledge. ”People don’t want to pay for what they don’t want to get.” But ESPN remains one of the world’s most profitable sports networks, and its struggles raise troubling questions about the entire TV ecosystem. Long considered the linchpin of the traditional bundle, live sports is often what compels viewers to stay with their cable provider rather than cut the cord. But as more consumers defect in the face of growing cable bills, what is happening at ESPN could end up affecting channels up and down the lineup. And for Disney, one of the world’s most powerful media companies, the problems at ESPN risk dampening the success of its other brands, such as Star Wars, Marvel Studios and Pixar. ”Most of the Disney empire is healthy, but its stock price has been suffering to the downside because we have weak subscriber growth at ESPN,” said Laura Martin, a media analyst at Needham and Co. ”So that weak subscriber growth is a shadow over the whole empire.” ESPN and its siblings, such as ABC, account for the biggest chunk of Disney’s business by far, pulling in $24 billion in revenue this fiscal year. The company’s next biggest segment, theme parks, made $17 billion. It wasn’t that long ago that observers were calling ESPN ”the most valuable media property in the United States,” estimating its value at 20 times that of the New York Times Co. and five times the size of Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp. Since hitting a high of nearly $122 in the summer of 2015, the stock has dropped about 14 percent; that includes a 5 percent rally this week. Although ESPN disputed Nielsen’s methodology, the ratings firm ultimately stood by its numbers.  A spokesman for ESPN referred questions to the network’s parent company. Disney did not respond to multiple requests for comment. Last month, in an interview with CNBC, Disney chief executive Bob Iger said he remains confident in ESPN. ”We think the   revenues are going to be just fine,” he said. ESPN is hardly the only programming company facing   pressure as consumers increasingly opt for   video streaming that undercuts the legacy cable bundle. TV providers such as Dish Network and AT&T have raced to offer packages of traditional channels as   apps; the outlook for those efforts is still uncertain, but some analysts say ESPN faces a steeper challenge than most because of the rapidly rising cost to the network of acquiring sports broadcasting rights. ”Let’s face it   sports has changed,” said Jim Hill, a longtime Disney analyst. ”It’s gotten so expensive . .. it’s a scary time all around the barn right now for sports, and that’s another thing that Disney’s eyeballing.” The rights to broadcast live sports cost cable companies a collective $16 billion last year, according to a report from PricewaterhouseCoopers  —   up 50 percent from 2011. That figure is expected to grow another 30 percent by 2020. Between the rising content costs and the defection of consumers, some analysts have proposed that Disney spin off its ESPN unit. This week, Steve Cahall, a media analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said the move would allow investors to gain a better understanding of Disney’s fundamental profitability. He added it could earn Disney some cash to invest in its remaining businesses, or make Disney an attractive purchase to other companies. Earlier this fall, Liberty Media chairman and longtime   titan John Malone also said that Disney could explore a sale of ESPN. But some analysts are pushing back against the idea, saying there are institutional and logistical reasons why Disney would be loath to sell off one of its key assets. Disney’s chief Iger tends not to micromanage parts of his business unless he perceives a serious problem, Hill said. ”He’s a very, very, very   guy as long as you’re making money,” Hill said. ”The way Iger’s thinking is, ’Look, I’m going to keep hands off for a while until you guys figure it out. ’” Media executives are aggressively courting the 20 million U. S. households of   or people who have never had a TV subscription. HBO, Showtime and CBS have all launched   video apps as a way to lure customers into paying for their television content.    (Jackdaw Research)  ESPN, too, has a streaming app of its own   but it is limited in what   can view there. The app reserves its best programming for traditional TV subscribers to prevent too many cable customers from migrating away. Eventually, ESPN may conclude that its subscriber losses are so great that the only way to retain those customers is to begin offering cable content more widely on the app, said Jan Dawson, an analyst at the market research firm Jackdaw Research. ”I do see ESPN eventually doing an HBO   online service,” he said. ”I think it’s inevitable.” Other analysts, however, argue ESPN’s outlook is not much worse than other companies in the media business. In fact, cushioned as it is by Disney’s film and theme park businesses, ESPN may have some time to reverse its fortunes. By contrast, firms that are almost exclusively about TV, such as Discovery Communications or Scripps Networks Interactive, do not have that luxury, Martin said. ”They’re losing subscribers, but they don’t have theme parks to protect them,” she said.

","         The   dog stood on her owner’s hospital bed and leaned into his face, sniffing around a tangled mess of wires to find him. Ryan Thomas Jessen had gone to the hospital for what he thought was a migraine, but it turned out to be a brain hemorrhage, his sister, Michelle Jessen, wrote on Facebook earlier this month. The hemorrhage, which doctors believe may have been brought on by high blood pressure, would prove fatal. But before Jessen died, the    Californian’s family wanted to let his dog, Mollie, see him one last time. “The hospital did the sweetest thing for us and allowed us to bring my brother’s dog in to ‘say goodbye’ so she’d know why her human never came home,” Michelle Jessen explained on Facebook. “If you knew my brother, he really loved his sweet dog. ” Relatives captured the heartbreaking moment and shared it on social media. The video has since been viewed more than 10 million times. “Buddy? Hey, Ryan?” a man says in the video. Then a woman calls out, “Hey, Daddy Ryan. ” “Hey, Ryan,” the man says again. “Say goodbye. Bye bye. ”  “Bye bye, Daddy Ryan,” the woman says. The dog’s frenzied sniffing fills the aching silence. “There he is; can you smell him?” the man gently asks the dog. “Yeah. ” Then, they help the pup find a spot to lie down between her human’s legs.  Jessen’s mother said on Facebook that her son died Nov. 30. “He thought he had a migraine, but it was a ventricular brain hemorrhage,” she wrote. “It happened so quickly. ” She said her son was an organ donor and that his family members were grateful to be able to help others. His sister said in a message that a    boy would receive Ryan Jessen’s heart. “As sad as it is to lose Ryan,” Michelle Jessen wrote, “we know his heart is going to bring so much joy to the family of the recipient. I wish Ryan could know what a difference his heart will make for that young man. ” As for Mollie, she will remain with relatives. “Don’t worry about the dog!” Michelle Jessen wrote. “We’re keeping her! !!

142190,217576,I used to shame people for buying fake Christmas trees. Now I have one.,Washington Post,Jura Koncius,2016-12-05,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161211001801/https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/home/i-used-to-shame-people-for-buying-fake-christmas-trees-now-i-have-one/2016/12/02/3bc92060-b8ac-11e6-a677-b608fbb3aaf6_story.html
","      Our family’s move over to the faux side this holiday didn’t play well on Instagram.  Last week, I posted a photo of our recent stop at Home Depot to shop for fake trees. The comments ranged from “What? !?!? !” “No” and “I am so sorry” to “This AND the election? Way too much for one month. Sigh. ” A “face screaming in fear” emoji was posted. And there were offers of   candles. I was clearly being  .  And I totally deserved it. Throughout my design writing career, I have been a traditionalist, making clear my disdain for silk flowers and artificial plants and my love of fine linen tablecloths and real candles. I chastized my colleagues, calling their     trees tacky and shuddering in horror at the stories of how some consumers slipped   pine car air fresheners in the depths of their fake firs.   Last winter, I wrote about the horror of gas fireplaces vs.   ones.  I also wrote an article in 1999 shaming people who had fake trees. I am now ashamed of it. But rereading it, I realized that, back then, my very meticulous husband wrapped our tree with 1, 000 lights. Last season? The tree topped out at a   2, 000 lights.  In that article, his painstaking procedure was well described by our     son. “Dad sits down on the floor and starts straightening out the strings of lights. Then he starts wrapping them around the tree. It takes all day. Or even two days. He’s sort of grumpy, especially if some of the lights go off after he’s all finished. Sometimes, when he finds a knot in the string, he gets really mad. Mom and I stay out of his way. ”    We got a   model to fit more easily into the corners of our colonial house. We went with faux pinecones and a bit of white frost so it would actually look faux. It has only 650 white lights. But who’s counting? (  Stewart Living)  Last year, after my husband spent two days stressfully working on lighting the tree, he ran out of time. My son, now 26, arrived for the holidays and spent a day finishing up the lights so we could put our hundreds of ornaments on the tree by the deadline: Christmas Eve dinner for nine people. Why did we go fake? It could save our marriage. But there are other reasons, too. ● We just had our living room painted and got a new rug. Who wants branch scratch marks on the walls, sap stains on the rug and water marks on the hardwood floors?  ● We were tired of dragging the tree in from the back yard, littering the whole house with needles and drawing blood from our hands. Not to mention the pain of watering the tree daily. ● The emergency trips to CVS for more lights were getting out of control. We are convinced there is a conspiracy to manufacture lights that last no more than one season. They seem to go bad just as you’ve finished installing them while lying on your back. ● We were sick of stockpiling the tiny packages of fuses that come with each string of lights. Do you know of anyone who has successfully replaced a fuse? ● The idea of local tree lots selling real trees that already have strings of lights wrapped around their branches by trusty elves never took off.    Yes, the real thing is worth it, but real life gets in the way. My son was all in. My husband said the choice to go fake was disappointing, but he could use the extra two days for something else. “The biggest hurdle for a traditionalist like me is realizing the taste police won’t be at your door if you give up on a real tree,” he said. As we were finishing up our transaction at Home Depot, my    Chris called. My husband explained that we were loading our     into the car. “You bought a fake tree?” Chris asked Morgan. “Yes,” Morgan replied. I was proud of him for his forthright honesty. “What would Martha Stewart say?”  “She’d love the idea,” Morgan said. “We bought one of her trees. ”   More from Lifestyle:   Boomers are ready to retire from the holiday hubbub, but their kids won’t let them   An expert’s tips on making your holiday party memorable, without showing off   The proper way to wash, store and use your formal tablecloths and napkins   The rules for setting your holiday table and why they matter   "
142191,217577,Add social-media expectations to the list of things you tell a new babysitter,Washington Post,Estelle Erasmus,2016-12-06,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161211001801/https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/on-parenting/add-social-media-expectations-to-the-list-of-things-you-tell-a-new-babysitter/2016/12/05/60181b98-b595-11e6-b8df-600bd9d38a02_story.html
"," When my regular babysitter went on vacation, she suggested I hire her younger,    sister, who had previously worked for me as a mother’s helper. The morning after our new sitter watched our    daughter, I heard how it went. “We had fun, Mom,” our little girl said. “And right before I went to sleep, I talked to a nice,   boy. ” I felt a frisson of panic run though my body. “What do you mean? Did someone come in the house?”  “No, I saw him on her phone, on FaceTime, like how we talk with Daddy when he’s on a business trip. ”  My husband and I have worked hard to protect our daughter from too much screen time, keeping her away from social media and the dangers of strangers interacting with her. The idea that my daughter had   with a boy I didn’t know felt as if a stranger had been in our house, sitting on the couch with our young daughter. I felt unsettled.    (Bee   The Washington Post)    When I asked the sitter about it, she said her friend had FaceTimed her with a question about homework. Her voice was    as she explained something that is obviously second nature to her  —   and to most teens today.   “This can’t happen ever again,” I said, and then explained: “I don’t want her talking to or meeting anyone I don’t know in person or online, and I don’t want anyone to see my home that way, either. ” Our sitter apologized and said it wouldn’t happen again, but it made me see how normal this was to her and my daughter.   Most parents who hire caregivers know the importance of babysitting safety. They instruct caregivers to adhere to bedtimes, make sure the kids eat a vegetable at dinner, don’t let them cross the street without holding a hand. But few parents realize how smartphones, tablets and apps can affect their children’s safety right in their own home. And it’s not just about safety: Many sitters rely on screens to entertain kids when parents have rules against it. According to statistics in a babysitter survey by Care. com, 26 percent of families have caught their sitter texting, and 22 percent have caught them playing on social media when they were supposed to be watching their charges.   issues now trump the smaller 11 percent of parents catching their sitters having a friend over or looking through their drawers. Sitters may have good intentions when introducing children to games, social media and geotracking activities, such as Pokémon Go, but they may not be considering the consequences. Although in cred ibly rare, one innocent mistake, such as posting and tagging a photo of your child or checking in at a park, could result in an online predator finding your child’s location. In fact, Pokémon Go was recently found to deliver kids directly to sex offenders’ homes.  Although Instagram’s geotagging system can be disabled, it can easily be turned back on by accident, alerting people to your child’s every move. And if a sitter posts a photo of your child doing something wacky, it could go viral, as has happened, playing havoc with your family’s serenity.   Just as with any other instructions they give a new sitter, parents should also outline their rules for   use. “Communication is your best weapon,” says Kim Estes,   expert and founder of the website Savvy Parents Safe Kids. “It’s also important for you to realize that sitters  —   particularly young teens  —   are not trying to be sneaky. There is a   generational technology gap. They think it’s normal to share everything online, and we don’t. Because they don’t share the same values as us and don’t see it as a danger, we need to be clear with our expectations. ”    That communication extends to children, from a very young age, as well. Talk to them about family rules and how they are in place to keep them safe, and then adjust as necessary as they get older. Then, when a sitter comes over, give your children “a gentle reminder in front of the sitter to ‘remember our family safety rules,’ ” Estes suggests. “This way your child will know that he or she can refuse to do something that breaks the rules, even if the sitter suggests it. ”   Add Snapchat to the growing list of   apps that might cause problems. Many sitters enjoy using it with kids because of its fun face filters. The danger with the app is that because photos and videos disappear after a maximum of 10 seconds, it feels temporary, but all it takes is a screen shot for a picture or message to live forever. Colleen Bohensky, a New Jersey mom, saw photos of her friend’s   and    on Snapchat after that friend’s babysitter posted them. “I was the one who saw the photos,” Bohensky said. “I swiped on the pics and messaged her about how cute her boys looked. ” Her friend, who had a strict    rule, was upset. She’s planning to speak to her sitter but is unsure what to do. She doesn’t want to have to follow her sitter on social media to be sure that she isn’t posting pictures of her kids. “It’s unfortunate, because she is an amazing sitter otherwise. ”    usage is a key subject to address with a sitter, says Genevieve Thiers, founder of the online   company Sittercity and the   app Chime .  “Cut it off at the pass,” she suggests. “Say, ‘Please don’t share pictures of my kids, and don’t show them   screens.’ ” And if a sitter puts a photo on social media and you find out about it? “Immediately call (don’t text) and ask them to take it down,” she said. “Explain why it is important and that it is a nonnegotiable. ” Estes is a fan of Circle With Disney, a $99 tool that allows you to set limits on what children can access online and to monitor access to all devices on your home network. Lynn Perkins, founder and chief executive of UrbanSitter  agrees that it’s up to parents to set boundaries. “When meeting with a new babysitter, you will want to walk them through your child’s routine and get them familiarized with your home,” Perkins says. “Some of the parents who use our service say, ‘Please only use your phone in case of an emergency, if you need to text me a question or when the   is asleep.’ Others ask sitters to keep their children off of their   feeds. And then there are the parents who say it’s okay to take photos or videos to send to the parents, but then they have to be immediately deleted. ‘And don’t tag people or locations or use my kids’ names or our last name.’ ”       Jo Frost, formerly known as “Supernanny,” is practical about digital abuse. “Like we overused playpens in the 1980s and 1990s by sticking our children in them, today we are misusing technology as an electronic babysitter. But since it is here to stay, we need to embrace it, regulate it and use it in moderation,” she said in an interview. It’s fine for nannies to use the phone for emergencies or to take a funny photo or video and send it to the parent, she said, but they need to be hands on with children and use their imagination and creativity to entertain them. “It’s not okay to use devices as a sitter for kids. It takes them out of the moment. ”   Parents are still feeling their way when it comes to making rules about babysitters and social media. Because the field is so fluid, with new apps developed every day, it’s hard to tell what we are going to be dealing with in the future. “No matter what, it’s essential to protect children  —   particularly young children  —   from situations that they have yet to learn to be discerning about and can’t make choices on,” says Irina Harris, a New   therapist. “You have to decide what your rules are on the use of devices and apps, then you have to convey them to the sitter, plus spell it out to the child in simpler terms. It all takes a bit of work. ” I told Harris that after the FaceTiming issue, I let everyone know that our house safety rule is “Nobody in, nobody out, and that includes on social media. ” My sitters and my daughter need to understand that if someone comes into my home digitally, it is the same as letting them in the front door. And that’s not okay.        Estelle Erasmus is a journalist, author and writing coach. You can find her on Twitter @estelleserasmus  "

"," Are you getting enough choline? Chances are, this nutrient isn’t even on your radar.  It’s time choline gets the attention it deserves. A shocking 90 percent of Americans aren’t getting enough choline, according to a recent study published in the Journal of the American College of Nutrition. Choline is a hot research topic and for good reason. It’s essential to health at all ages and stages, and is especially critical for brain development. Why aren’t we getting enough? Choline is found in many different foods but in small amounts. Plus, the foods that are rich in choline aren’t the most popular: think liver, egg yolks and lima beans. Why haven’t we heard about choline until now? Marie Caudill is a professor at Columbia University and an expert on the impact of choline on maternal and infant health. She says choline hasn’t been a nutrition focus until now because “it was assumed for a long time that because our bodies make choline, we don’t need to worry about our dietary intake. “Choline is critical to so many metabolic pathways, so our body does have the ability to make some. During pregnancy, the body’s ability to produce choline is ramped up by estrogen. However, our studies and others have shown there is depletion of choline during this life stage. ” Taylor Wallace is an affiliate professor in the Department of Nutrition and Food Studies at George Mason University who worked on a recent analysis of choline intake in the United States. He says, “There isn’t enough awareness about choline even among   professionals because our government hasn’t reviewed the data or set policies around choline since the late ’90s. ” Health benefits of choline Just as vitamin D plays a supportive role in calcium absorption, choline helps   fatty acids and B vitamins such as folate function as they should. Here are the potential benefits of choline under study.  Choline during pregnancy and breastfeeding: Most women of   age are well aware of the importance of folate for a baby’s developing nervous system, yet many aren’t aware that choline is also needed. Pregnant women are also concerned about getting enough DHA, since a growing body of research has linked prenatal consumption of this fatty acid to improved cognition later in life. Choline plays a similar role as DHA in being required for membranes of nervous system cells. According to Caudill, “Studies show if you give pregnant women more choline, the mother will make more choline that contains DHA and this will be specifically directed towards the placenta and the baby. ” In animal studies, getting enough choline prenatally and during childhood is linked to improved learning,   skills and memory later in life. Caudill notes that “when pregnant women supplement with choline, their babies are born with lower levels of the stress hormone cortisol. This could have lifelong beneficial effects in terms of reducing chronic disease risk. ”  Brain and heart health: Did you misplace your keys again or forget to call someone back? Choline plays a role in processing and storing memories, functions that are critical for learning and knowledge retention. In animal studies, having enough choline appears to have an impact on activating parts of the brain responsible for memory. Choline is one of the building blocks for acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter thatfunctions as a chemical messenger in the brain. Choline is also part of the membrane of all cells and plays a role in signaling between cells. Because acetylcholine is needed for nerves to signal muscles such as the heart, choline is needed to regulate the heart rate at rest.  Choline and the aging brain: A new area of interest is whether improving choline intake could prevent cognitive decline as we age. Researchers have observed that high blood levels of the amino acid homocysteine in older adults is linked to poor performance on cognitive tasks and functions such as object naming, concentration and language. Choline intake appears to have an inverse relationship with homocysteine levels, spurring further investigation into the role choline may play in brain health in older adults.  Liver health: Choline helps move fat out of the liver, helping prevent nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. In doing so, choline also frees up the liver to perform its key functions of filtering and detoxification and turning food into energy.  Sports performance: Choline is needed for the brain to signal working muscles. Not having enough choline  —   and therefore acetylcholine  —   during exercise could slow down the message from your brain to your muscles to contract, potentially making you tire more quickly during endurance exercise. In animal models, when muscles don’t get enough choline, muscle cells start to break down. The movement of fat out of the liver to be used as energy also decreases when choline levels are too low. How to get enough choline The recommended daily intake for choline is 550 mg a day. Here’s what that would look like in food:  Breakfast:  ●2 whole eggs  Lunch:  ●3 oz chicken breast ● ⅓ cup lima beans  Dinner:  ●1 sole fillet: 102 mg ●1 cup Brussels sprouts Obviously your diet will and should have more variety than this day to day. Overall, include a variety of meats and green vegetables in your diet to help you meet your choline needs. To get more choline, choose   dishes such as frittatas and quiche. Beef, chicken and fish, as well as Brussels sprouts and broccoli, also contain some choline. If you aren’t already eating your egg yolks, you should be. A recent   and reviews of the research suggest that eating egg yolks regularly doesn’t increase the risk of coronary heart disease or stroke. Having two whole eggs a day provides half of the choline most people need.  As awareness about choline continues to rise, you’ll start to see more   foods on grocery store shelves. You may also consider taking a choline supplement. Unfortunately, choline is not in your multivitamin or even prenatal vitamins.  Caudill advises that pregnant and lactating women eat two eggs (including yolks) a day to help boost choline levels. For those women who don’t eat eggs or other animal protein, taking a choline supplement of 350 mg a day is “highly advisable. ” Wallace says most people will need a choline supplement. “According to the 2015 Dietary Guidelines for Americans, modeling of different healthy diet patterns found people would still fall short of their daily choline needs. ” Because everyone will be getting various amounts of choline through their diets, talk to a registered dietitian or your physician about whether you need a choline supplement and how much to take. For infants, formulas are fortified with choline. If you are breastfeeding, speak to your   provider about whether you should supplement with choline. The good news: You’ll start to see choline in some Nutrition Facts tables, as the FDA has made it a nutrient that can voluntarily be put on the new food labels. Soon you’ll be able to identify which packaged foods are rich in choline at a glance.  Christy Brissette is a dietitian, foodie and president of 80TwentyNutrition. com.

142193,217584,"Key GOP senators join call for bipartisan Russia election probe, even as their leaders remain mum",Washington Post,Elise Viebeck,2016-12-11,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161212003914/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2016/12/11/key-gop-senators-join-call-for-bipartisan-russia-election-probe-even-as-their-leaders-remain-mum/
","     Two Senate Republicans joined demands for a bipartisan probe into Russia’s suspected election interference allegedly designed to bolster Donald J. Trump as questions continue to mount about the  ’s expected decision to nominate a secretary of state candidate with close ties to Russia. Sens. Lindsey Graham ( . C.) and John McCain ( .)  —   the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee  —   joined calls by incoming Senate Democratic leader Charles E. Schumer (N. Y.) and Armed Services ranking member Jack Reed ( . I.)  for a thorough, bipartisan investigation of Russian influence in the U. S. elections. Their statement came two days after The Washington Post reported the CIA’s private conclusion that Russia’s activities were intended to tip the scales to help Trump.        Donald Trump as well as Republican and Democratic lawmakers on Dec. 11 reacted to the CIA’s assessment that Russia intervened to help Trump win the election. (Bastien   Washington Post)   “Recent reports of Russian interference in our election should alarm every American,” the four senators said in a statement on Sunday morning. “Democrats and Republicans must work together, and across the jurisdictional lines of the Congress, to examine these recent incidents thoroughly and devise comprehensive solutions to deter and defend against further  . ”  “This cannot become a partisan issue. The stakes are too high for our country. We are committed to working in this bipartisan manner, and we will seek to unify our colleagues around the goal of investigating and stopping the grave threats that cyberattacks conducted by foreign governments pose to our national security,” they added. But McCain and Graham  —   who frequently criticized Trump before and after his election  —    have often bucked Republican leaders, and their embrace of a   Russia probe does not necessarily signal support from other Republicans, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell ( . ). One GOP senator  —   Sen. James Lankford (Okla.) who serves on the Senate Select Intelligence Committee  —   agreed with McCain and Graham’s decision to support a bipartisan investigation of suspected cyber intrusion by Russia in the U. S. elections. “Cybersecurity investigation of Russian interference can’t be partisan,” Lankford tweeted Sunday. Republicans may be loathe to join calls for such a   investigation into Russia’s   activities given that Trump has dismissed the CIA claims as “ridiculous. ” They may worry about picking an obvious fight with the   before he is even inaugurated. Trump has signaled he wants a warmer relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin, who he praised during the campaign. “I think it’s just another excuse. I don’t believe it . . . No, I don’t believe it at all,” Trump said of the CIA charges on “Fox News Sunday. ”      CIA officials told senators it is now ”quite clear” that electing Donald Trump was Russia’s goal. In an interview on Fox News Sunday on Dec. 11,   Trump denied the CIA’s assessment. (Victoria   Washington Post)    McConnell himself has been notably silent since the Post report was published on Friday night, and his   Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn ( ) downplayed the significance of it in a series of tweets  —   although some of them suggested Congress’s review of Russian actions should broaden. “All this ‘news’ of Russian hacking: it has been going on for years. Serious, but hardly news,” Cornyn tweeted Saturday. The Texas Republican seemed to support, however, a wider look at Russia as a global actor rather than one confined to its role in the U. S. election, retweeting the below tweet from Graham: “  undermining NATO, Ukraine, butchery in Syria, etc. I intend to look at all things Russia  —   not just election influence. ”   Hear, hear! https:  .   —   JohnCornyn (@JohnCornyn) December 10, 2016   Meanwhile, House Speaker Paul Ryan ( .) in his first substantial comment on Russian hacking since the report Friday, said Sunday he “rejects any politicization of intelligence matters,” calling foreign intervention “unacceptable. ” For the most part, other key Republicans were silent on the issue of whether to embrace a bipartisan look at whether  Putin’s government was behind the hacks of the Democratic National Committee emails and their publication by WikiLeaks in an alleged bid to help Trump and damage Hillary Clinton’s campaign. At the same time, several Republican senators raised concerns about Trump’s likely nomination of Rex Tillerson, ExxonMobil CEO, as secretary of state due to his  ties to Putin. Republicans in a    Senate have only the slimmest of margins to get him confirmed, should Democrats decide to uniformly oppose the nomination. Only three Republicans would need to side with Democrats in order to defeat Tillerson. “It’s a matter of concern to me that he has such a close relationship with Vladimir Putin, that that would color his approach to Vladimir Putin and the Russian threat,” McCain told CBS’s Face the Nation. “Being a ‘friend of Vladimir’ is not an attribute I am hoping for from a Secretary of State,” Rubio tweeted Sunday. Republicans outnumber Democrats by only one vote on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, which must approve a secretary of state nominee before the full Senate votes. Over the weekend, several committee Democrats, including Sens. Bob Menendez (N. J.) and Chris Coons (Del.) stated their deep skepticism of Tillerson as a candidate. Menendez called the idea Tillerson could be named secretary of state “alarming and absurd,” concluding that “the Trump administration would be guaranteeing Russia has a willing accomplice in the President’s Cabinet guiding our nation’s foreign policy. ” Yet the committee’s chairman, Sen. Bob Corker ( .)  —   who was considered a possible pick for Trump’s secretary of state  —   has said Tillerson would be a good choice. “If it is Rex Tillerson, he is a very good individual,” Corker tweeted. Should Tillerson make it to a floor vote, Democrats could not block the nomination alone. If Democrats stick together, Republicans must muster at least 50 of the 52 votes they will have to successfully confirm him, as Vice   Mike Pence could cast the   vote. Graham has already also strongly hinted that he might oppose the nomination. “I don’t know the man much at all, but let’s put it this way: If you received an award from the Kremlin, order of friendship, then we’re gonna have some talkin’,” Graham said early Saturday morning. “We’ll have some questions. I don’t want to prejudge the guy but that’s a bit unnerving. ” Mike DeBonis contributed to this report."
142194,217585,New push to replace Obamacare reignites old GOP tensions,Washington Post,Mike DeBonis,2016-12-11,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161212003914/https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/new-push-to-replace-obamacare-reignites-old-gop-tensions/2016/12/11/b460b5cc-be3a-11e6-ac85-094a21c44abc_story.html
"," Republicans on Capitol Hill are already laying the groundwork for a rapid repeal of President Obama’s signature   law beginning on the first day of the new Congress, before   Donald Trump is even sworn in. But the urgent efforts to make good on a Republican campaign promise six years in the making obscure major GOP divisions over what exactly to replace Obamacare with and how to go about it, and how long a transition period to allow before the law’s insurance would go away.   are pushing to move as fast as possible, bolstered by a GOP base eager to see lawmakers follow through on years of promises. But key congressional leaders are keenly concerned about potentially throwing millions off their insurance plans and repeating what they have long decried as Democratic missteps eight years ago, sparking a fierce political backlash by moving too far, too fast. While Trump could sign legislation gutting the Affordable Care Act before the spring bloom, a full replacement could take months, if not years. “I’d like to do it tomorrow, but reality is another matter sometimes,” said Sen. Orrin G. Hatch ( ) chairman of the Senate Finance Committee that will help lead the “repeal and replace” efforts. “We have to live with the real world. And the real world right now is that the Democrats won’t help with anything. ”   Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell ( .) has announced plans to put an Obamacare repeal on the Senate floor on Jan. 3. (Jonathan  )  Hatch and other   Republican senators are pushing for an extended transition period that could keep large portions of Obamacare in effect until 2019 or beyond, allowing time to carefully craft a replacement and push the final debate past the midterm elections. Many of them, like Sen. Susan Collins ( ) have been chastened by conversations with insurers and state regulators who are warning of chaos in the market for individual insurance if Congress moves rashly. “I don’t want to leave the 84, 000 people in Maine who are buying insurance on the exchange uninsured because, all of a sudden,   of them who have subsidies have lost that subsidy,” Collins said. But those Republicans are clashing with GOP colleagues  —   many of them sent to Congress in the midterm,   waves of 2010 and 2014  —   who see little reason to dawdle. “The history of this place is, the longer it takes, the more exponentially the probability grows that it’ll never get done,” said Rep. Mark Meadows ( . C.) elected recently as the new chairman of the   House Freedom Caucus. “Republicans have been saying they have a replacement plan for over two years, so why do we need three years?” Part of the problem is that Republicans have never been able to agree on a replacement plan, despite railing against Obamacare for nearly eight years now. Their   is a function of internal divisions and the political peril of floating a detailed alternative that would be closely evaluated for costs and benefits. Trump has also been vague, promising a “terrific” replacement that will provide “great health care at a fraction of the cost. ”  The current battle centers on when exactly to schedule Obamacare’s sunset. But other fights loom  —   over what precisely a replacement plan should look like, whether Obamacare’s Medicaid expansion will continue, whether lawmakers should also now tackle the future of Medicare, and how Congress should assist insurers during the transition. The battle lines, however, are familiar, with “establishment” Republicans on one side and conservative insurgents, mainly in the House, on the other. Those dynamics pushed GOP leaders into increasingly dramatic confrontations with President Obama and last year helped force House Speaker John A. Boehner ( ) to retire. Come Jan. 20, Obama will no longer serve as a foil for Republicans, and while Senate Democrats could block parts of a   overhaul, the real fight will occur inside the GOP. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell ( .) has announced plans to put an Obamacare repeal on the Senate floor come Jan. 3. But that will only set the stage for a future repeal bill that will have to tackle major decisions such as a sunset date and interim measures to stabilize insurance markets. So far, Trump and key GOP leaders on Capitol Hill have shied away from taking firm positions on repeal and replace, but they have done little to tamp down the expectations of conservatives expecting a swift and wholesale substitute. “We’re going to repeal Obamacare lock, stock and barrel,” Vice   Mike Pence told donors to the conservative Heritage Foundation recently. “The number one priority of this administration is to keep that promise to the American people. ”   on Capitol Hill see Pence and Rep. Tom Price ( .) Trump’s pick for health and human services secretary, as allies in their push for quick and decisive action. Pence called on Congress to pass a repeal bill “with all deliberate speed” but pledged only to then “set into motion a process to replace it. ” House Speaker Paul D. Ryan ( .) said Thursday that Republicans would move “as well and as fast as we can but make sure that the transition does not pull the rug out from under people. ” Transition spokesman Sean Spicer said Friday that Obamacare replacement strategy has been part of discussions Trump and Pence are having with top congressional leaders and that the talks are ongoing. “The idea is to really figure out the sequencing on both the repeal and the replace,” he said. Conservative activists who pushed a    approach toward the Obama administration say their patience is limited. “When Republicans have the House, the Senate and the White House, you don’t wait,” said Adam Brandon, president and chief executive of FreedomWorks, a conservative advocacy group. “I’m a Cleveland Indians fan. I only get a shot at a World Series every couple decades. When you have a shot to do it, you do it. That’s it. ” Democrats and many   experts are warning that a swift repeal could lead insurers to stop selling policies to individuals on federally mandated exchanges. More than 12 million Americans are covered under those policies. Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell briefed Senate Democrats on Thursday on the expected unraveling of Obamacare’s insurance exchanges, according to people familiar with her remarks inside the   meeting. “Delayed replacement is a situation where it is basically repeal and chaos in terms of what will ensue, because of the uncertainty that will get presented to insurers, providers, consumers and states,” Burwell told reporters after the meeting. Republicans want to end Obamacare’s system of penalties and subsidies. But many  —   including Trump  —   want to continue to ban insurers from denying coverage or sharply increasing rates for the sick. Experts warn that “repeal and delay” under those conditions would prompt insurers to flee the individual market. Linda J. Blumberg, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute, said insurers could face as much as $3 billion in losses if healthy individuals leave the market once the subsidies and penalties are eliminated. “That $3 billion is the tip of the iceberg,” Blumberg said. “With all of these changes and the uncertainty, it is hard to predict how bad the risk is going to get. ” Keeping insurers in the market during the transition could require Congress to step in with bailout payments, something that would be deeply unpopular among conservative lawmakers. “The insurance industry should understand that there’s a new sheriff in town,” said Rep. Ken Buck ( .) a Freedom Caucus member. “They signed up for Obamacare, and if they want to make a profit, they’re going to have to figure out how to make a profit in a   insurance industry. ” The strategy of repealing Obamacare without first replacing it reflects not only the wishes of the GOP base, but also Senate arithmetic. There will be a slim    Republican majority come January, and while Republicans can gut Obamacare with a simple majority using arcane budget rules, passing a complete replacement will require 60 votes. Only by dismantling Obamacare first, Republicans say, will they have a chance to persuade enough Democrats to support a replacement plan  —   and Democrats have already signaled that they will not do so.  “We all know we have to repeal it to get them to even settle down and work with us at all,” Hatch said. Incoming Senate Democratic leader Charles E. Schumer ( . Y.) however, has rejected that strategy. “We’re not going to do a replacement. If they repeal without a replacement, they will own it,” he told The Washington Post recently. But the Republican base, prodded by conservative media outlets and   activist groups, has been loath to accept Democratic obstruction as an excuse for inaction. One prominent activist, Jenny Beth Martin,   of the Tea Party Patriots, suggested that Trump could goose the    efforts by reversing an administrative ruling that gave financial assistance to 11, 000 congressional members and staff who were forced onto the Obamacare exchanges under a compromise included in the original law. “I don’t think anyone thinks that you’re going to flip a switch . . . but the replacement for it needs to happen quickly,” she said. “We want it done as quickly as it possibly can be done. ” Brandon was even blunter: “This is going to be a hard thing for Republicans, but tough [cookies],” he said. “They’re going to have to push this through using parliamentary maneuvers, and guess what? It’s hard. “The political risk in doing nothing is why you got Donald Trump in the first place,” he added. “The old excuses of having divided government, they’re gone. ” A few strident Obamacare critics are urging activists to soften a bit. “They have to look at the complexity of the problem here, and hopefully they’ll recognize that it’s not quite so simple,” said Sen. Ron Johnson ( .) who was first elected in the 2010 tea party wave. But many others are not. “Literally every Republican member has made this part of their platform in running for Congress,” said Rep. Mark Walker ( . C.) a   who will chair the conservative Republican Study Committee next year. “We’ve got to act on it. ”  John Wagner and Amy Goldstein contributed to this report. "

We need to adjust accordingly.,Washington Post,Chris Cillizza,2016-12-11,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161212003914/https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-has-completely-upended-the-political-game-we-need-to-adjust-accordingly/2016/12/11/38599570-bfbb-11e6-b20d-3075b273feeb_story.html
"," The election of Donald Trump was a     moment in American politics. As in, everything that we  —   the collective political horde  —   thought was conclusive about how you win an election (outspend your opponent, build a better organization, lead in polling, run more TV ads) was disproved in one fell swoop on Nov. 8. Trump did everything wrong  —   by these traditional standards  —   and he won. And it wasn’t the first time. The traditional rules of the road would have meant that Trump never rose beyond the 1 percent of the vote with which he started the Republican primary fight. The idea that a candidate could bully and insult his way to the Republican nomination over 16 (largely) serious candidates was simply unthinkable. The “rules” said it couldn’t happen. Trump, to his immense credit, understood that a) flouting the rules actually endeared him to a big swath of voters and b) there just might not be any real rules at all. That insight allowed him to play a totally different game in both the primary and the general election. While the political establishment was   over Trump’s fight with a Gold Star family or his comments about the weight of a former Miss Universe, the real estate mogul was in the process of remaking how political campaigns are won. Through a combination of a massive social media presence, his celebrity and the belief  —   disproved by facts, but no matter!  —   that he was a straight shooter, Trump took every rule of the game and not just broke it but smashed it.     The Fix’s Callum Borchers explains the history of the “protective pool” of reporters that traditionally follows the president, and recounts a few times when a protective pool ended up being critical. (Peter   Washington Post)   All of which meant that on Nov. 9, the political establishment was left to look at the shards of conventional wisdom scattered everywhere to try to find some meaning. And how did we do it? In most cases by falling back on the very same assumptions and analytical points that led us to miss “Donald Trump, president” so, so badly.    How could Trump chat with the Taiwanese president, breaking decades of protocol and potentially endangering our fragile détente with China? How could he pick  —   or be on the verge of picking  —   the chief executive of ExxonMobil as secretary of state? Or Ben Carson, a doctor, to head the Department of Housing and Urban Development? Or, more parochially for reporters but no less hidebound by tradition, not agree to have a protective press pool follow him wherever he goes? Or a hundred other smaller breaks with “the way things are done” that Trump has engineered over the past month or so? The simple truth is that Trump’s transition process has been a logical continuation of the campaign he ran: a total disregard for the established methods and the rules governing those methods. If you back Trump, you are undoubtedly thrilled with these moves, believing that he promised radical change in a broken Washington and is delivering on it. If you oppose Trump, you see his flouting of the established order as not only risky but deeply dangerous. I take no side in that fight. But I do think that it’s absolutely necessary to avoid using the old measures of success or failure to assess Trump. He has proven, repeatedly, that those metrics simply do not apply to him. To continue to analyze him and his moves as we would, say, President Jeb Bush or President Hillary Clinton, is to ignore the fact that any traditional analysis of the campaign Trump ran would never have put him anywhere near the White House.  Two major questions remain: 1. Is Trump’s ability to innovate in the political campaign space  —   that’s exactly what he has done, whether you like it or not  —   something that can carry over to his time in the White House? Do voters want something different in a president than they want in a presidential candidate? If so, Trump’s unwillingness to change could badly damage his presidency. 2. Is Trump an exception in politics or the new rule? Is it his unique combination of celebrity, social media and brashness coupled with these deeply   times a  ? Or does he represent a new normal in politics? Will the 2020 campaign be filled with Trump takeoffs  —   Mark Cuban, Howard Schultz, Kanye West(?)  —   or will it be the usual assortment of governors, senators and House members? I don’t know. What I do know is that Trump is like nothing else we’ve ever seen in modern American politics. We all need to adjust accordingly. "
142196,217587,Trump says ‘nobody really knows’ if climate change is real,Washington Post,Juliet Eilperin,2016-12-11,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161212003914/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2016/12/11/trump-says-nobody-really-knows-if-climate-change-is-real/
","       Donald Trump said Sunday that “nobody really knows” whether climate change is real and that he is “studying” whether the United States should withdraw from the global warming agreement struck in Paris a year ago. In an interview with “Fox News Sunday” host Chris Wallace, Trump said he’s “very  ” on whether climate change is underway but has serious concerns about how President Obama’s efforts to cut carbon emissions have undercut America’s global competitiveness. “I’m still  . Nobody really knows,” Trump said. “Look, I’m somebody that gets it, and nobody really knows. It’s not something that’s so hard and fast. I do know this: Other countries are eating our lunch. ”  There is a broad scientific consensus that human activity  —   including the burning of fossil fuels for transportation, heating and industrial manufacturing  —   is driving recent climate change. In its most recent report, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change concluded that it is “extremely likely” that, since the 1950s, humans and their greenhouse gas emissions have been the “dominant cause” of the planet’s warming trend. The top 10 hottest years on record have all been since 1998, and 2016 is expected to be the hottest year since formal   began in 1880. But it’s not the first time that Trump has disregarded that established scientific view. During the presidential campaign, Trump referred to climate change as a “hoax” perpetrated by the Chinese, a comment he later described as a joke. But during a town hall in New Hampshire, he also mocked the idea of global warming. At that event, Meghan Andrade, a volunteer for the League of Conservation Voters, asked Trump what he would do to address the issue, to which he replied: “Let me ask you this  —   take it easy, fellas  —   how many people here believe in global warming? Do you believe in global warming?” After asking three times “Who believes in global warming?” and soliciting a show of hands, Trump concluded that “nobody” believed climate change was underway except for Andrade. During Sunday’s interview with Wallace, Trump said he needed to balance any environmental regulation against the fact that manufacturers and other businesses in China and elsewhere are able to operate without the kind of restrictions faced by their U. S. competitors. “If you look at what  —   I could name country after country. You look at what’s happening in Mexico, where our people are just  —   plants are being built, and they don’t wait 10 years to get an approval to build a plant, okay?” he said. “They build it like the following day or the following week. We can’t let all of these permits that take forever to get stop our jobs. ” The U. S. has outpaced the rest of the developed world in terms of growth since the 2008 recession, though developing countries such as China boast higher growth rates. Typically, economists compare the U. S. against other industrialized nations since developing countries typically grow faster than their developed counterparts. The New York businessman made the same critique of the Environmental Protection Agency, to which he has nominated Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt  —   a climate change skeptic  —   as the head. Wallace asked whether he was “going to take a wrecking ball to the Obama legacy,” to which Trump replied, “No. No. No. I don’t want to do that at all.  I just want what’s right. ” “EPA, you can’t get things approved. I mean, people are waiting in line for 15 years before they get rejected, okay? ” he said. “That’s why people don’t want to invest in this country. ” It is unclear which permit application Trump was referring to, but he has repeatedly criticized EPA rules. And though he has given mixed signals on whether he would back out of the United States’ voluntary commitments under the Paris climate agreement, it would take several years for the next administration to withdraw now that the agreement has entered into force.  Last week Trump’s transition team for the Energy Department asked officials there to identify which employees have participated in international climate negotiations or worked on domestic efforts to cut greenhouse gases, such as calculating the social cost of carbon. Several scientists, federal union officials and public watchdog groups have expressed concern that these individuals could be targeted for retaliation once Trump takes office.      The Trump transition team has issued a list of 74 questions for the Energy Department, asking officials there to identify which department employees and contractors have worked on forging an international climate pact as well as domestic efforts to cut the nation’s carbon output. (Whitney   Washington Post)   At the urging of daughter Ivanka, Trump has met in the past week with former vice president Al Gore and actor Leonardo DiCaprio, both environmental activists.

","     The Post’s blockbuster story on Friday reported: The CIA has concluded in a secret assessment that Russia intervened in the 2016 election to help Donald Trump win the presidency, rather than just to undermine confidence in the U. S. electoral system, according to officials briefed on the matter. Intelligence agencies have identified individuals with connections to the Russian government who provided WikiLeaks with thousands of hacked emails from the Democratic National Committee and others, including Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman, according to U. S. officials. Those officials described the individuals as actors known to the intelligence community and part of a wider Russian operation to boost Trump and hurt Clinton’s chances.  Trump on Friday released a particularly   statement, which will only feed suspicions about his affection for Vladimir Putin. “These are the same people that said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction,” it read. “The election ended a long time ago in one of the biggest Electoral College victories in history. It’s now time to move on and ‘Make America Great Again.’ ” That he would adopt the Kremlin’s position in the face of overwhelming evidence, supported by U. S. intelligence professionals, is in and of itself of grave concern.      CIA briefers told senators in a   briefing it was now ”quite clear” that electing Trump was Russia’s goal, according to officials. (Victoria   Washington Post)   Former CIA director Michael Hayden, speaking on CNN, expressed astonishment. “To have the   of the United States simply reject the   narrative that the intelligence community puts together because it conflicts with his a priori assumptions. Wow,” he said. “He continues to reject the Russians did it   …     and claims that it was politicized intelligence. ” Following the president’s announcement on Friday that he ordered a “full review” of Russian hacking, the incoming Minority Leader Sen. Charles E. Schumer ( . Y.) called for a full congressional review. Schumer is right that the bombshell should shake both parties to the core. But Republicans now must decide where their highest loyalties rest  —   with Trump or with the defense of the country and our electoral system. The Post’s report provided an astonishing revelation: Republicans allegedly refused during the election to make a bipartisan defense of the sanctity of our electoral system. “According to several officials, [Senate Majority Leader Mitch] McConnell raised doubts about the underlying intelligence and made clear to the administration that he would consider any effort by the White House to challenge the Russians publicly an act of partisan politics. ” The report continued: “Some of the Republicans in the briefing also seemed opposed to the idea of going public with such explosive allegations in the final stages of an election, a move that they argued would only rattle public confidence and play into Moscow’s hands. ” Some Republicans in their narrow, partisan prism might think this about trying to invalidate the election. It’s not. Sen. Susan Collins ( ) told Right Turn, “The purpose of any investigation, whether by the Obama administration or Congress, is not to question or relitigate the results of any past or present presidential election. ” She explained, “Instead, any review must focus on the   task of improving the defenses of the United States against cyberattacks, including those that might seek to affect or influence political campaigns. ” It’s also about determining the degree to which Russia tried to pick our president, why Russia picked Trump and whether Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov was correct in declaring there had been extensive conversations with the Trump campaign, a charge the Trump team immediately rejected. This sounds like an    spy thriller. Unfortunately, this is all too real and raises numerous troubling questions:  Why did Russia want Trump to win? Why does Trump disagree with our intelligence community? Who is telling him its conclusion is wrong? Does the hacking have anything to do with the coterie of   advisers around Trump? With Trump’s efforts to undermine NATO? With his desire to “get along” with Putin? Has Trump reportedly chosen Rex Tillerson, chief executive of Exxon (who has no national security experience) for secretary of state because Tillerson is cozy with Putin and opposed sanctions? What conversations, if any, went on between Trump’s campaign and Russians, and what was the substance of those? Does Trump have financial interests (or liabilities) with Russian oligarchs  —   which he is concealing by refusing to release his tax returns? Why did Republicans before the election refuse to stand up for the integrity of our electoral system?  Trump and his advisers would be well advised to let the investigations run their course without heckling, criticism or interference. Trump would also be smart to be entirely transparent about financial, political or personal ties he or his advisers may have with Russia. If he does not, speculation will run rampant that he has something to hide. “Russia’s efforts to interfere in the U. S. elections are unprecedented in American history,” Michael E. O’Hanlon, a senior fellow in foreign policy at the Brookings Institution, told Right Turn. “Never before has technology allowed such widespread,   and   effects. ” He added, “Whether one thinks they swayed the outcome or not, whether Vladimir Putin thinks we try to do the same thing to influence elections in   ways in countries like Ukraine or not, all Americans should be alarmed. And that puts it mildly. ” The Senate must   Trump’s nominees, determine what their views on Russia are (and the basis for them) and get a clear understanding of what they will do in office to respond to Russia’s attempt to interfere with our electoral system. Any underqualified or unqualified nominee who appears unwilling to see Russia for what it is  —   an aggressive kleptocracy  —   should not be confirmed. Tillerson’s expected nomination did not sit well with the ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. In a memo sent to reporters by the staff of Sen. Benjamin L. Cardin ( .) Trump’s response was bashed as “a cavalier dismissal that comes nowhere near the gravity of what’s been reported. ” The memo slammed Trump for “reportedly planning to nominate a Secretary of State with business ties to Russia and Vladimir Putin and whose company worked to bury and deny climate science for years. ” Sen. John McCain ( .) said on CNN he had “concerns” about Tillerson’s relationship with Putin, and if his concerns were not satisfied he would oppose the nomination. That we are even facing the potential that a secretary of state would be inappropriately sympathetic toward a foe of the United States reaffirms how extraordinary the situation is in which we find ourselves. GOP lawmakers need to act without a trace of partisanship and with alacrity and seriousness to get to the bottom of this  —   for it was their leaders reportedly who prevented a strong bipartisan show of strength in the face of replete evidence of Russian mischief. They should follow the example set by Collins, who told me, “a bipartisan congressional investigation could be useful towards achieving an objective accounting of any alleged meddling by foreign adversaries. The nefarious   emanating from both Russia and China that has been well known for years has become increasingly brazen and aggressive. ” If Republicans appear to be dragging their feet, afraid that their election behavior will come back to bite them, the only recourse would be an independent prosecutor   an independent commission (some Democrats have already suggested this). A Senate Democratic source noted that for now it will be up to Republicans to call formal hearings and expressed confidence that investigative staff on the relevant committees can do a lot of digging on their own. The source noted, however, that access to information will be the key, which is why Democrats have been calling for declassification of relevant material. Finally, the Russia connection makes it imperative for bipartisan consensus on two points: full release of Trump’s tax records and full divestiture of his holdings. “Frankly, we don’t know if and to what extent he has business ties to Russia. He continues to refuse to release that information,” Jordan Libowitz, the communications director for Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, told me. “This is yet another reason why disclosure and divestment are so critical, so that any business ties with Russia will be known and removed. ” Is Trump profiting, or has he profited, from Russian oligarchs? Conversely, is he literally in debt to them? Congress must demand Trump immediately sever all ties to his companies and liquidate his holdings so the proceeds can go into a truly blind trust operated by a neutral party. Trump’s entire approach to Russia is certainly of concern. “Trying to get along with Russia is fine; I had some sympathy for Trump’s views on this matter during the campaign,” O’Hanlon remarked. “But his willingness to turn over a new leaf must not be done out of naivete  —   and if it is, a backlash is likely, once his bromance with Putin ends and he winds up bitter and betrayed, as would be the likely outcome of his team [being] too chummy with a guy who clearly can’t and shouldn’t be trusted. ” It’s time for Republicans to live up to their oaths of office and for once put partisan hackery aside. If they cannot defend the country in the case of a suspected act of espionage launched against our democratic elections, they should resign forthwith. UPDATE: In a blistering statement Sen. Robert Menendez ( . J.) wrote that Tillerson’s nomination was “alarming and absurd. ” He declared, “With Rex Tillerson as our Secretary of State, the Trump administration would be guaranteeing Russia has a willing accomplice in the President’s Cabinet guiding our nation’s foreign policy. The term conflict of interest doesn’t even begin to describe the web of dubious business interests and bank accounts that Tillerson and his company Exxon shares with Vladimir Putin and Russian oil companies. Having no practical experience in diplomacy, Mr. Tillerson has no proven knowledge or regard for the norms and necessities that so much of our modern diplomatic and security efforts depend upon. ” It’s fair to say he will be a “no” on the confirmation vote: “As a member of the Senate committee tasked with vetting our next Secretary of State, I will do everything at my disposal to ensure our nation’s next    is someone who has the experience, insights and capabilities to truly protect America’s best interests and preserve our essential alliances across the globe. ” UPDATE II: Rep. Adam Kinzinger ( .) a rising GOP star, was measured in his response. An adviser explained that while he was “encouraged by the seriousness’ with which Trump made most of his Cabinet picks, ” His concerns remain about the affinity for Putin and Russia and he has been outspoken about those concerns. Congressman Kinzinger anticipates learning more in uncovering the entirety of Russia’s involvement in the 2016 election, and the breach of our intelligence community. ” The adviser added, “As he has said, Russia is not our ally, and Putin cannot be trusted. To think otherwise is severely misguided. ”"
142198,217593,Donald Trump says he wants to fix cities. Ben Carson will make them worse.,Washington Post,Thomas J. Sugrue,2016-12-06,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161212003914/https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2016/12/06/donald-trump-says-he-wants-to-fix-cities-ben-carson-will-make-them-worse/
","         Donald Trump talked more about cities than any   candidate for president in decades. The picture he painted was bleak. He described “inner cities” as hellholes and depicted urban blacks as the tragic victims of generations of neglect. He visited Detroit, blaming ostensibly liberal public policies for its long depopulation and decline, conveniently overlooking decades of cuts in urban funding and a bipartisan neglect of cities that dates back to the early 1970s. He falsely claimed that urban crime is skyrocketing (it has declined steadily since the early 1990s, falling to a near   low). And he pledged to fix it. Trump’s fixer is now in line. On Monday, the   officially named former neurosurgeon and onetime GOP presidential candidate Ben Carson as his nominee for secretary of housing and urban development. Carson grew up in a   neighborhood in Detroit, the son of a housecleaner, but there’s certainly nothing in his medical career that indicates he’s the best pick for the job: While Carson was on the faculty of the Johns Hopkins University medical school, located in one of the nation’s poorest and most troubled big cities, he took little interest in urban issues. In his   primary campaign, he railed against “social engineering,” a swipe at efforts to open housing in mostly    overwhelmingly white communities to minority home buyers and renters. Trump’s selection of Carson echoes Ronald Reagan’s choice of Samuel Pierce as his HUD secretary. Like Trump, Reagan had lashed out against inner cities and pledged to slash social spending. Like Trump’s supporters, the majority of Reagan’s voters did not live in cities. And like Trump, he had little support among African Americans. But like Trump, Reagan wanted a black face in a high place for a little legitimacy in a     White House. And, like Trump, Reagan had pledged to loosen housing and financial regulations.  HUD was an easy target for Reagan, as it is for Trump. It had been created by Lyndon B. Johnson at the peak of his Great Society to meet the huge demand for affordable housing in American cities and to grapple with the ravages of mass suburbanization, nearly complete racial segregation and capital flight from cities, all of which had been heavily bankrolled by the federal government. In 1968, HUD took on the additional responsibility of “affirmatively furthering fair housing,” the gargantuan task of undoing decades of discriminatory real estate and   practices. None of these missions was popular: Republicans criticized HUD as a meddling “big government” agency. Southern Democrats railed against its civil rights goals. And suburban whites fiercely resisted even modest efforts to open the housing market to racial minorities. Attacked from all sides, HUD struggled for adequate funding from the outset. In the meantime, the department became a bastion of crony capitalism, particularly under Republican presidents. In the early 1970s, its program to expand Federal Housing   mortgages to underserved urban areas was hijacked by real estate speculators and politically connected developers, who sold shabby houses to desperate buyers at   prices, backed by inflated appraisals. When buyers defaulted on their mortgages (especially as interest rates spiked) taxpayers covered the loss. HUD was unwilling to come down hard on predatory lenders or to stiffen regulations. Pierce was the perfect agent for Reagan’s mission to gut HUD. He oversaw dramatic cuts in the agency’s already meager budget. Federal support for    subsidies plunged from $26 billion to $8 billion. More than that, Pierce undercut HUD’s civil rights mission: Housing was nearly as segregated at the end of the 1980s as it had been at the decade’s start. Urban housing conditions deteriorated, the construction of affordable housing slowed to a trickle, and urban poverty deepened. HUD, however, still channeled money to private housing developers and contractors. And under Pierce, the vultures circled. He had little management experience and no oversight. The job bored him. HUD staffers frequently found him at his desk watching television . Pierce’s staff turned over with alarming frequency. Seven assistant secretaries for housing came and went, and the agency became a patronage mill for inexperienced Republican hacks. Reagan and Pierce were also zealous advocates of turning HUD’s responsibilities over to the private sector. (One of Pierce’s assistant secretaries resigned when it came out that HUD staffers had helped him type and proofread his book, “Privatizing the Public Sector. ”) HUD’s privatization efforts opened up new possibilities for crony capitalism. Staffers directed money to   lawyers, consulting firms and developers. One of the dozens swept up in the resulting investigations by federal prosecutors and Congress was Trump’s former campaign manager, Paul Manafort  who had successfully lobbied for about $43 million in federal subsidies for a shabby New Jersey housing complex. He received $326, 000 in fees for his efforts and eventually owned a 20 percent share in the development, which showed few signs of improvement after winning the HUD grants. Eventually, more than a dozen HUD staffers and external consultants were convicted on charges including taking bribes, accepting illegal loans, defrauding the government and lying to Congress. (Manafort was never charged with wrongdoing.) History never repeats itself exactly, but Pierce’s time at HUD offers some warnings for Carson’s nomination. Like Pierce, Carson is shaping up to be a token black Cabinet member. Trump has not appointed any other black officials so far, and given his lack of   black supporters, he doesn’t have many prospects. Like his predecessor, Carson has little management experience. And like Pierce, he will oversee an agency whose budget includes substantial contracts with politically connected nonprofits, real estate developers and mortgage lenders. The possibilities for corruption are legion with a HUD secretary who knows nothing about the agency, its programs or its vastly complex budget.  HUD turned 50 last year. Metropolitan America has changed a lot in the   since Johnson created the agency. But cities’ problems are no less pressing, even if Trump left them unaddressed on the campaign trail as he railed about crime. In most urban areas, economic and racial inequality has spiked. Urban housing is a case study in market failure: too much for the rich and, in many cities, for international speculators, while affordable,   housing is scarce, especially in rapidly gentrifying cities such as New York, Washington and Los Angeles. Even poorer cities such as Detroit, Philadelphia, St. Louis and Milwaukee have huge waiting lists for subsidized housing units. Poverty has risen sharply in the suburbs. Many of the poorest Americans, urban or suburban, are left to the vagaries of a predatory rental market. Few   and poor people can afford to live in   suburbs and exurbs or send their children to the   school districts. And many municipalities are struggling with collapsing tax bases, decaying infrastructure and aging housing. We don’t know much yet about how Carson will run HUD, but his lack of experience with urban policy, his bromides about socialist planning, his indifference to fair housing and his calls for individual   don’t bode well for the future of metropolitan America. And in a climate of privatization and deregulation, championed by the country’s new real estate developer in chief, Carson’s inexperience could be a serious liability."
142199,217594,Syrian troops pull out as Islamic State militants sweep back into ancient Palmyra,Washington Post,Louisa Loveluck,2016-12-11,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161212003914/https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/battle-rages-for-palmyra-as-islamic-state-is-poised-to-retake-control/2016/12/11/396552ea-bf9a-11e6-afd9-f038f753dc29_story.html
","  BEIRUT  —   Syrian troops pulled out of the ancient city of Palmyra on Sunday as Islamic State militants claimed they had regained full control of the area less than a year after being driven out. Victory in the symbolically significant city would mark a startling reversal of the militant group’s fortunes after months of setbacks and suggests that the Islamic State remains a resilient force. The Amaq news agency, which is linked to the Islamic State, claimed Sunday that the group had regained “full control” of Palmyra, while the   Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said President Bashar  ’s troops had withdrawn to the south.  The local governor, Talal   said that the decision had been made to prepare for a counterattack “in the coming days. ” Long considered one of the world’s greatest archaeological treasures, Palmyra’s ancient Roman complex was partly destroyed by the Islamic State during its earlier   occupation of the nearby modern city. The group ruled with an iron fist, repurposing an iconic amphitheater as a stage for executions and enacting brutal punishments against residents who broke laws it imposed. Russian airstrikes facilitated the Syrian government’s recapture of Palmyra in March. This weekend, Moscow’s bombing raids pushed the militants back only briefly, forcing a dawn retreat from the city before they swept back in hours later. A Syrian activist from Palmyra who uses the pseudonym Khaled   said residents remaining inside the city as the militants swept in Sunday were among the area’s poorest. Barazi, the governor, said that no more than 15 percent of the local population had returned since the Islamic State’s previous occupation.  Palmyra was built as a tribute to the visiting Roman emperor Septimius Severus more than 2, 000 years ago. Like many of the country’s ancient treasures, Palmyra’s ruins have been looted by government forces, damaged in fighting and airstrikes and shattered with dynamite during the Islamic State’s previous spell in power. The group had been advancing steadily since Thursday while the government waged a major offensive against rebels in the northern city of Aleppo. Under pressure across its   “caliphate” in Syria and Iraq, the Islamic State appeared to be using the Palmyra attack in part as an opportunity to resupply its arsenal. Video footage by the group and news reports from   reporters suggested that the group’s fighters had looted military weapons stocks. The attack was also a reminder that the group’s defeat may be a long way off. The offensive coincides with a major U. S.  operation by the Iraqi government for the city of Mosul, where hopes for a swift victory against the Islamic State are fading as the militants put up a stiff fight.  The group still controls large portions of Syria, including much of the vast eastern desert where Palmyra is located. The U. S. military announced Saturday that it was sending an additional 200 Special Operations troops to northern Syria to help the mostly Kurdish force that is battling the militants there. The assault on Palmyra also serves as a reminder that the Syrian army, despite substantial gains against rebel forces in recent weeks, is thinly spread, suffering from shortages of manpower and weary after more than five years of war. The   eastern portion of Aleppo seems poised to be recaptured soon by government troops, who are being aided by Iranian advisers; Shiite militias from Iraq, Afghanistan and Lebanon; and Russian airstrikes. The government has also been making   advances against rebels around the capital, Damascus. But in a pattern that has emerged throughout Syria’s war, gains on one front have meant drawing down troops on another, leaving government positions exposed. In Palmyra, a limited troop presence was all that remained when the Islamic State launched its assault, according to activists.  In a video published by Amaq on Saturday, Islamic State militants were seen routing army sniper positions, kicking soldiers’ corpses and waving military identification cards for the camera. In an apparent attempt to save face, the Russian military blamed the militants’ advance on its pilots’ unwillingness to cause civilian casualties. Since launching bombing raids on Assad’s behalf in September 2015, the Russian air force has been accused by human rights groups of targeting civilian areas in most provinces across Syria.

142200,217596,Israel wants mosques to turn the volume way down,Washington Post,William Booth,2016-12-11,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161212003914/https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/israel-wants-mosques-to-turn-the-volume-way-down/2016/12/11/8631e9b0-b538-11e6-939c-91749443c5e5_story.html
","   JERUSALEM  —   When the call to prayer begins in the Palestinian neighborhoods here, the Muslim faithful hear a song beautiful and sublime. Hour by hour, five times a day, it is the soundtrack of their lives. And it stirs deep emotions.  Across the walls, across the lines that separate Arabs from Jews, the Muslims’ call to prayer means something very different. The Jews hear noise, they say. And worse. During periods of heightened violence, when the Jews who live near Palestinians hear the Arabs proclaim that “God is great!” in a broadcast that travels far from the mosque’s loudspeakers, they say they do not think of God. They hear a threat.   An Israeli flag waves in front of the minaret of a mosque in the Arab quarter of Jerusalem’s Old City. (THOMAS    Images)  Israeli lawmakers now are pushing legislation to ban mosques in Israel and East Jerusalem from using loudspeakers to issue the call to prayer, especially in the early morning, when the summons begins as early as 4. The bill is being debated, and its sponsors hope to pass it in coming weeks. One might think that after centuries of Jews and Muslims living side by side, in war and peace, these issues would be settled  —   but that would be naive. The bill’s proponents describe the   “muezzin law” as necessary, not to clip religious freedom but to muzzle excessive noise. The sponsors say their goal is to safeguard quality of life. As might be expected, a proposed ban on amplified calls to prayer has touched a raw nerve .  The Muslims say their sacred tradition cannot be compared to a rowdy party to be shut down by police. In Pisgat Zeev, a Jewish settlement in East Jerusalem, Yael Antebi lives in a sunny apartment with a terrace overlooking a dry desert riverbed. In the distance is a refugee camp for Palestinians in Shuafat, which today does not resemble the “camp” it was generations ago but rather a city with   apartments, a mall and narrow, twisting streets. “In tense times, the call feels threatening,” said Antebi, who sits on the Jerusalem city council and is a deputy mayor. To her visiting grandchildren, who do not live near Arab villages, “the sound is frightening. ” Antebi said the mosques crank up the volume during conflicts. The prayer calls were especially loud in the summer of 2014, during the Gaza war. “It’s like they’re trying to get inside your head,” she said. Motti Yogev, a member of parliament from the   Jewish Home party, introduced the bill after hearing from frustrated Jewish residents who live in   mixed cities of Arabs and Jews in Lod, Acre, Haifa, Ramle and Jerusalem. “People came to me to complain about the sound from the muezzin all day, but especially in the early morning,” he said. “The mosques would put their speakers right up near the homes of Jewish people and wake them up. ” He said some of those grumbling were Muslims, too. Arabs make up about 20 percent of the Israeli population, and most are Muslim. Yogev said that years ago when there were no   systems or electricity, Muslims would knock on doors to let people know it was time for prayer. Or they would sing from the minaret without amplification. That was  . “Now they can put it on the phone or an alarm clock,” he said. “They don’t need to broadcast it on speakers. ” In the Palestinian neighborhoods, residents see the threats, too. In Shuafat, locals said the muezzin bill is nothing more than power politics, the strong against the weak. “This call doesn’t hurt anybody,” said Kamal Abdul Khader, a former boxer who works as a bus dispatcher in Shuafat. “You know what the call is? The call is to come and pray to God,” he said. “The Jews don’t want to hear this? Tell me why. ” Told it wakes people up, Khader laughed and pointed at the chaotic street scene with its cacophony of honking horns, cellphone rings and pop music blasting from shops. “Listen, this is Jerusalem. We Muslims don’t complain when the Christians ring their church bells. We don’t complain about the Jews with their ram horns. This is religion,” he said. “No one should interfere. ” Men attending Shuafat’s main mosque agreed. One recalled that he had heard the muezzin bill was changed to protect Jewish customs. In the deeply Orthodox communities of Israel, sirens often wail on Friday afternoons to mark the beginning of the Sabbath. Sometimes a trumpet or ram’s horn is sounded. After the bill was first introduced, it was criticized by   Jewish lawmakers worried that it could apply to the customs of their constituents. Proponents agreed to amend the bill to protect the Sabbath sirens. The bill has broad support in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government. “I cannot tell you how many times people of all faiths are bothered by this,” Netanyahu said recently. The prime minister pointed to ordinances in Europe and the Middle East that control the volume or hours of the muezzin’s call. “Israel is committed to freedom of religion, but it must also protect citizens from the noise,” he said. There are some who ask why such a divisive topic needs the blunt force of legislation and a ban. In the ancient port city of Jaffa, the mosques in a mixed neighborhood of Jews and Muslims in the Tel Aviv municipality agreed to reduce the volume. In two neighborhoods in East Jerusalem, members of the Jewish settlement of Gilo and their Palestinian counterparts in Beit Safafa were brought together by police to seek a compromise. There is a preliminary agreement to experiment with the placement of loudspeakers. Israel’s president, Reuven Rivlin, hosted a meeting of Muslim and Jewish clerics last month to seek a middle way, without a new law. “I am the son of someone who translated the Koran and observed the Jewish commandments, and I recognize the need to tread a fine line,” the president said. In Pisgat Zeev, the deputy mayor said she thought the legislation was a political stunt designed to do nothing more than incite the public. “It’s cheap populism,” Antebi said. “There are already laws on the books to control noise between the hours of 11 p. m. and 7 a. m. They can enforce them. ” At the mosque in Shuafat, the muezzin, who asked to be referred to as Abu Mohammad, said he has sung the call to prayer for 35 years. He was sorry to hear about all the complaints. He said he thought there was nothing more moving than hearing the call in the quiet of the dawn as it echoes across the desert where the prophets walked. “If there is a more beautiful voice than mine?” he said. “They can do the call. ”  Sufian Taha contributed to this report.

142201,217597,Is the D.C. mayor losing control of her city?,Washington Post,Peter Jamison,2016-12-11,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161212003914/https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/dc-politics/is-the-dc-mayor-losing-control-of-her-city/2016/12/11/0db36460-bd52-11e6-94ac-3d324840106c_story.html
"," Mayor Muriel E. Bowser is struggling to stand up to an aggressively liberal D. C. Council, which in the past six weeks alone has legalized assisted suicide in the nation’s capital and guaranteed new parents two months of paid time off. A moderate Democrat whose roots are in the   African American neighborhoods of Northeast Washington, Bowser increasingly finds herself at odds with a council infused with the leftist tendencies of the District’s millennial newcomers. Heading into her third year in office, the mayor appears to be losing ground, sidelined as lawmakers advance a wish list of progressive policies without her cooperation, and sometimes despite her opposition. The outcome could determine whether the city focuses on the national priorities of the political left  —   such as   programs and business regulation  —   or Bowser’s more conventional urban agenda of schools, crime and homelessness. The latest display of the mayor’s predicament came last week, as council members gave preliminary approval to a $250    program that will tax local businesses to provide   workers with some of the nation’s most expansive   and   benefits. Citing its expense and disproportionate benefits to commuters from Virginia and Maryland, Bowser has repeatedly said she does not want to carry out the plan, which creates a new agency with a budget larger than that of the Department of Public Works. But in a sign of her waning stature at city hall, it seems she will have little choice: The bill passed the council on its first reading with the supermajority necessary to override a veto. “The dynamics are different, because the entire shape and political bent of the council have changed dramatically in just two election cycles,” said Adams Morgan neighborhood activist and former council candidate Bryan Weaver. “This really does sort of show it’s a new era. It will be tough for the mayor. ” Bowser’s defeat on paid leave could portend other struggles as she tries to counteract what some criticize as the   ways of the council’s ascendant newer members. Even in overwhelmingly Democratic big cities, mayors  —   whose duties include fighting crime and fiscal stewardship  —   sometimes act as a check on expensive or provocative impulses from legislators. But Bowser will have few immediate tactical advantages as she tries to fulfill that role. When newly elected council members are seated next month, the bloc of four allies she relied on when she took office last year will shrink to one  —   Brandon T. Todd, her chosen successor for her old Ward 4 seat. Some fear that the combination of a weakened mayor and an inexperienced,   council could mean trouble as the city seeks to preserve its   fiscal stability, with major investments in its transit system required over the next several years and questions about the future of federal funding under   Donald Trump. “With so many new people on the council, there’s a lot to learn about our unique fiscal situation,” said longtime District political activist Marie Drissel. At present, she added, the mayor “really doesn’t have the kind of support” she would need to put the brakes on fiscally reckless legislation. City hall’s political equilibrium will be further unsettled by the return of former mayor Vincent Gray, who continues to command respect and influence despite a 2010   scandal that threatened to end his career. Gray, a relatively centrist Democrat who was elected to the council in November to represent Ward 7, is a potential ally for the mayor from an ideological standpoint. But many question whether they can overcome the ill will that took root during the bruising 2014 mayoral campaign, which Gray lost to Bowser. In an interview, Gray said he hoped to “work constructively” with the mayor despite their history, particularly on issues important to his constituents in the city’s poor easternmost neighborhoods. “I would hope that she and I can find common ground,” he said. Gray will join a group of legislators whose relationships with the mayor and her staff have frayed, most recently in the conflict over family leave. Council member David Grosso (  Large) attacked the mayor in a news release Dec. 5, the eve of the vote, saying she “cannot summon the courage to take a position” on paid leave herself and was instead working to gut the bill through Council member LaRuby May (  8) one of her outgoing allies. Such barbs are not particularly sharp by the standards set in recent showdowns at the John A. Wilson Building. In May, during a debate over city homeless shelters, a livid Bowser called Council Chairman Phil Mendelson (D) “a        liar” during a tense exchange that found its way into news reports. “I don’t think that’s helpful,” said former council member Sekou Biddle. Especially when a politician does not command natural allegiance from colleagues, he said, it is crucial to leach the venom from personal relationships in city hall. “It’s important to have a generosity of spirit,” Biddle said. “You have to, as much as possible, assume a positive intent from other people. ” Bowser declined an interview request. Her spokesman, Kevin Harris, said the mayor had been “incredibly effective” at moving her agenda through the council. “One vote on one issue doesn’t change an extensive track record of passing legislation and budgets that have put the District in much better standing then when she took office,” Harris said. Council member Elissa Silverman (  Large) a progressive who has served on the council since last year, said the mayor had done little to find common ground with opponents in areas where there is broader agreement, such as homelessness and education. “My hope is the mayor looks to do more   with the council in the future,” Silverman said. “I think these past two years has been more of an    ‘if you’re not with me you’re against me’ approach, which has limited our ability to work together in areas where we naturally agree. ” Silverman disputed what she said was a caricature of a runaway D. C. Council squandering taxpayer money. She said the council’s priorities have been similar to those in cities with similar demographics  —   such as San Francisco, Los Angeles and New York  —   and largely within the bounds of Democratic Party orthodoxy. “Paid leave is in the Democratic Party platform,” she said. “We’re not being crazy leftist radicals here. ” There are many nuances to the political roles and power dynamics inside D. C. city hall. One of the District’s progressive coups this year  —   a plan to gradually raise the minimum wage to $15  —   was led by Bowser, not the council. Nor has the mayor been wholly ineffective in combating the leftward drift of city policy. Bowser has defended the District’s legalization of marijuana, enacted through a 2014 ballot measure by the same voters who put her in office. But she drew the line early this year when the council sought to allow “clubs” where pot smokers could gather. Responding to her appeals, council members dropped the idea. Even on the landmark family leave bill, the extent of victory for the progressive council members is not clear. The bill is scheduled for a final vote Dec. 20, leaving Bowser time to lobby for amendments before it passes. The council has a vested interest in securing even grudging support from the mayor, who will be responsible for the program’s implementation.  Meanwhile, the breakneck pace of the city’s progressive agenda could be slowed somewhat by Mendelson, who is advocating a   moratorium on further workplace regulations to ease the effects of the   law’s tax on businesses. Veteran D. C. activist and government watchdog Dorothy Brizill said the mayor and council could be forced to take up an   common cause if the District faces meddling from the   federal government that will assume power in about a month. The new Congress and presidential administration  —   which have final authority over the city’s budget and legislation  —   could take aim at local laws and policies over which the District’s elected officials have no disagreement, such as gun control or   funding under the Affordable Care Act. “No one knows what a Republican in the White House, in the form of Trump, is going to mean for the District of Columbia,” Brizill said. “I think the mayor and the council are going to have a number of issues on their hands. ” "

","   “Saturday Night Live” didn’t begin with its familiar construction of Alec Baldwin impersonating   Donald Trump, but the show still brought in some outside star power for its cold open. In a sketch focusing on Trump’s controversial Cabinet picks, Bryan Cranston reprised his “Breaking Bad” character Walter White to play the incoming president’s nominee to lead the Drug Enforcement Administration. “Walter is amazing, he came highly recommended by Steve Bannon,” Kellyanne Conway (Kate McKinnon) says. “Oh, yeah. Steve’s the best. We’ve had some times,” White said. “We met on the comments section on Breitbart. ”  White, introduced as a high school science teacher from New Mexico, said he didn’t know Trump but, “I like his style. He acts first and then asks questions later. I also like that wall he wants to build. Nothing comes in from Mexico, meaning a lot less competition for the rest of us. ” Jake Tapper (Beck Bennett) asked, “You mean jobs?” “Sure,” White slyly responded. White said that “it’s time to make America cook again. We want to fill this nation with red, white and a whole lot of blue. ” Tapper listed off other   Trump picks, including Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt as the head of the Environmental Protection Agency. (Pruitt has sued the EPA on climate change several times). “Scott Pruitt is excited for the job and ready to protect us all from the environment,” Conway says in the sketch. “It’s almost like Mr. Trump appoints these people specifically to undermine the very agencies they head,” Tapper says. “Kellyanne, are these bad picks?” “No Jake, they are not bad,” she answers. “They are  . ”  Unlike in previous weeks, Trump didn’t tweet his criticism of the show. We were falling into a pattern, with Baldwin appearing as Trump and then, inevitably, the   Trump publicly weighing in, calling SNL “biased, not unfunny. ” He also called the show “unwatchable,” even as he continued to watch.         But this weekend’s show was different. Baldwin didn’t appear. And Trump didn’t criticize the show. That doesn’t mean SNL didn’t tackle Trump and make biting jokes at his expense. Aside from the cold open, Weekend Update brought on McKinnon to play German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who was 2015 Time’s “Person of the Year. ” In 2016, Trump was named “Person of the Year. ” “It kind of undermines the honor for me,”    said. “It’s like winning the Nobel for physics, and then the next year they give it to Hoobastank. ”   "

It did not go well. Celek’s snap was so bad that punter Donnie Jones picked up the ball and aborted Caleb Sturgis’s   attempt, preserving Washington’s   lead. To make matters worse for the Eagles, Celek was injured on a punt later in the quarter.

As Fox analyst John Lynch asked after Garcon’s   touchdown catch to give Washington a   lead late in the third quarter, “How about both?” Garcon’s third touchdown catch of the season, which Redskins Coach Jay Gruden will have you know came on a fade, capped a     drive and marked the second time this year that he and Jackson caught touchdowns in the same game. Garcon didn’t quite stick the landing.   Gruden: ”he got the touchdown on the fade by golly. You guys like that? It WAS a fade.”  —   Mike Jones (@MikeJonesWaPo) December 11, 2016     Watch your step pic. twitter.   —   Deadspin (@Deadspin) December 11, 2016   Worst throw: The Redskins’ maligned defense forced its first    on Philadelphia’s next possession, giving Cousins and the offense a chance to extend its lead with a score, or at the very least burn some time off the clock. Instead, Leodis McKelvin jumped an out route intended for Jackson, intercepted Cousins and returned it 29 yards for a touchdown. Cousins completed 14 of 21 passes for 234 yards, two touchdowns and one brutal pick.   McKelvin. Pick. Six. #FlyEaglesFly https:  .   —   Philadelphia Eagles (@Eagles) December 11, 2016   Best pass breakup: Trailing by two points after McKelvin’s touchdown and down to their third option at   the Eagles elected to go for two. Redskins cornerback Josh Norman broke up Wentz’s pass intended for Jordan Matthews on a slant route. Worst hit: Washington failed to muster a first down on its next drive after what was initially ruled a   catch to Jamison Crowder along the sideline was overturned on replay review. On the ensuing punt, Deshazor Everett drew a   penalty and nearly started a brawl by drilling Darren Spoles before he had an opportunity to field the ball. Sproles eventually walked off the field and Everett was not ejected from the game.   Deshazor Everett hits a defenseless Darren Sproles pic. twitter.   —   The Cauldron (ICYMI) (@CauldronICYMI) December 11, 2016   Best snap: All things considered, it was the snap by tight end Trey Burton  —   Eagles Coach Doug Pederson’s emergency   for the emergency    —   on Caleb Sturgis’s     field goal with 5:03 to play. Worst   efficiency: The Redskins’ offense converted two of its seven   attempts. The Redskins’ defense allowed the Eagles to convert on nine of their 18   attempts. Best flag: An illegal block in the back penalty on Zach Ertz wiped out a   punt return for touchdown by Sproles after Washington went    to start the second half. Best red zone  : The fade pass to the shortest guy on the field, because no one will expect it  —   not even the Redskins, who tried it last week. Washington’s lead   was   as Wentz drove the Eagles 77 yards on 12 plays, capped by a   touchdown pass to    Sproles in the corner of the end zone with 28 seconds to play in the first half. Worst coverage: The fade is an especially good   when the cornerback doesn’t bother to cover it. Bashaud Breeland, who was burned for a pair of   completions earlier in the drive, bit on an inside fake, leaving Sproles all alone for the easiest touchdown catch of his career. “Bashaud Breeland is killing them right now,” Fox’s Lynch said. Best Fat Rob: The Redskins took a   lead with 4:11 to play in the first half on a   touchdown run by Rob Kelley, whose path to the end zone was cleared by a huge block by Crowder on Eagles cornerback Nolan Carroll. Kelley, who made a nifty move on third and short to pick up a first down earlier in the drive, had eight carries for 42 yards in the first half. He finished with 16 carries for 63 yards.   the block by Crowder pic. twitter.   —   Danny (@recordsANDradio) December 11, 2016   Best   ’  : The Redskins were fortunate to only be trailing   after Philadelphia’s third drive stalled in the red zone and resulted in a   field goal by Caleb Sturgis. The Eagles held a nearly   advantage in time of possession and a   edge in total yards when the Redskins started their touchdown drive. Worst deja vu: Just as the Cardinals did a week ago, the Eagles received the opening kickoff and mounted a long drive against the Redskins’ defense. After allowing Arizona to convert 10 of its 16   attempts in last week’s loss, Washington allowed a   completion on Philadelphia’s first   attempt on Sunday that moved the Eagles into Redskins territory. Best stop: On third and three from the Redskins’   line, Kerrigan pressured Wentz into an incompletion, helping ensure that Cousins and Co. wouldn’t take the field with a   deficit as they did in Arizona. Sturgis’s   field goal gave the Eagles a   lead. Worst start: For the second consecutive week, the Redskins’ offense went    on its first possession. At least the offensive line didn’t commit any penalties. Best turnover: The Eagles were threatening again on their second drive after a   pass interference penalty on Quinton Dunbar. On third and three from the Redskins’   line, Wentz’s pass intended for Zach Ertz was intercepted by Everett in the end zone. Everett’s first career interception was the rookie Wentz’s 12th of the season and resulted in a touchback.

Hopkins made 15 of his first 16 field goal attempts this season, including two in Washington’s Week 6 win over the Eagles. Since then, he’s made only 13 of 19. Best domination: The Redskins have now won five consecutive games against the Eagles for the first time since they won six straight against Philadelphia from 1981 to 1984. That’s also the last time Washington has won five straight against any NFC East rival.    Chase Shrawder, 10, of Reading, Pa. holds a sign at Sunday’s game. (AP   Perez) "

"," Republican lawmakers are increasingly at odds with Donald Trump across a range of    domestic and national security issues, an early sign that the   Congress might resist some elements of the   ’s un or tho dox agenda. Although Trump maintains enthusiastic backing in many corners of the party, key members of the Senate and House have been outspoken in challenging his views of Russia and its interference in the U. S. election, warning of potential conflicts of interest arising from Trump’s   business interests if he does not fully divest from his company, and criticizing the tough approach that he has taken to some companies, including his threat to impose a stiff tariff on firms that move jobs overseas. There is also friction over Trump’s consideration of ExxonMobil chief executive Rex Tillerson to be secretary of state  —   with GOP advisers warning that a growing number of Republican senators may be unwilling to vote to confirm Tillerson because of his ties to Russia. No issue has so clearly divided Trump and top Republicans lawmakers as much as his dismissal of U. S. intelligence agencies that attributed the hacking of the Democratic National Committee and other political targets to Russian operatives. The tensions were exposed over the weekend, as Trump belittled the CIA following a Washington Post report that the agency believed that Moscow favored Trump in the election while several Republicans, including Sen. John McCain (Ariz.) joined with Democrats to call for an investigation into the matter. “The Russians are not our friends,” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell ( .) told reporters Monday, voicing his support for an inquiry. McConnell stopped short of endorsing a special select committee investigation, as some lawmakers have suggested, but said that the Senate Intelligence Committee is equipped to take on the matter. “This simply cannot be a partisan issue,” he said. McConnell also appeared to break with Trump in his assessment of the CIA, saying that he has “the highest confidence” in the intelligence community and that the CIA is “filled with selfless patriots, many of whom anonymously risk their lives for the American people. ” McConnell, meanwhile, declined to defend Tillerson against accusations that he is too close with Russia, telling reporters that he would not comment on a hypothetical “phantom nominee. ” McConnell’s reluctance to engage on Tillerson came after some of his allies on national security issues, including Sens. Lindsey O. Graham ( . C.) and Marco Rubio ( .) raised doubts about the ExxonMobil chief’s background. Tillerson received the Order of Friendship from Russian President Vladimir Putin in 2013, two years after ExxonMobil won a contract to explore for oil in a   area of the Arctic Ocean. The agreement has been frozen since the United States imposed sanctions on Moscow following Russia’s 2014 incursion into Ukraine. Some senior GOP advisers fear that the   relationship will make Republicans reluctant to support the nomination. One adviser, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said as many as seven might now be unwilling to vote to confirm him as the nation’s top diplomat. McCain said he would give Tillerson a fair hearing if the oil executive is nominated, but on Monday the senator questioned his judgment for being close to the Russian president. Putin “is a thug and a murderer,” McCain said on CNN, “and I don’t see how anybody could be a friend of this   KGB agent. ” D. J. Jordan, a spokesman for Sen. James Lankford ( .) said Monday that the lawmaker “has a lot of questions about Mr. Tillerson and his ties to Russia,” though Jordan added that Lankford is “hopeful that those questions will be addressed in the days ahead. ” A big test for Republicans Taken together, the tensions between the   and fellow Republicans on Capitol Hill reflect a major test for how the GOP congressional majorities will handle the unusual circumstances of the Trump era. Republicans, many of whom opposed Trump during the presidential primaries, want to work with him in many areas and avoid alienating his enthusiastic voter base. Yet some in the GOP are also assessing how to fulfill their constitutional duties as a check on a   who is unaccustomed to the public scrutiny inherent to a democratic system and unconcerned with past traditions of transparency, particularly when it comes to his personal finances. They also must prepare for the potential that Trump, who has effectively harnessed Twitter to skewer his critics, could turn his ire toward them. Democrats, for their part, have little power to investigate Trump or thwart his nominations. In 2013, Democrats  —   angered by what they described as years of Republican obstruction  —   voted to scrap the rule requiring at least 60 senators to approve a procedural hurdle and move to a final confirmation vote. Now, all of Trump’s nominees for the executive and judicial branches, with the exception of picks for the Supreme Court, can be confirmed on a   vote. With 48 seats in the Senate, Democrats in that chamber need to win over only a handful of Republicans to block a nominee, though doing so requires a degree of Democratic unity. That could be difficult, with 10 of the party’s senators facing reelection in two years in states that Trump won. Incoming Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer ( . Y.) and his leadership team have urged senators set to serve as ranking members on top national security, financial and    committees to focus on hiring professional investigators able to quickly dive into the personal and financial backgrounds of Trump’s nominees, according to a senior Democratic aide. The hope is that Democrats will be able to dig up dirt on Trump’s nominees just as Republicans did to some of President Obama’s   nominees in the early days of his administration. The larger drama is likely to take place among congressional Republicans, who will face pressure to help Trump. So far, House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (Wis.) has demonstrated a reluctance to challenge the    on some of the issues that have animated his GOP colleagues. On Monday, Ryan dismissed calls for an investigation into Russian meddling in the election, saying that the House Intelligence Committee is “working diligently on the cyber threats posed by foreign governments and terrorist organizations. ” He also appeared to criticize suggestions that Russia favored Trump, saying in a statement that “exploiting the work of our intelligence community for partisan purposes does a grave disservice to those professional and potentially jeopardizes national security” and that “we should not cast doubt on the clear and decisive outcome of this election. ” Ryan also has waved off concerns about Trump’s potential conflicts of interest related to his global real estate and branding empire. Asked last week by a CNBC interviewer how he hoped the   would handle his business after he takes office, Ryan replied, “However he wants to. ” “This is not what I’m concerned about in Congress,” he said. Trump has said he will hold a news conference Thursday to announce how he will handle the business while he is in office. Trump has hinted that he will retain an ownership stake while putting his adult children in charge of the company’s operations, telling “Fox News Sunday” that “essentially I’m not going to have anything to do with the management. ” Ethics experts and lawmakers in both parties have warned that if Trump retains his stake, he will face congressional hearings and, potentially, investigations into whether he has a direct and personal financial stake in the decisions he is supposed to be making in the public interest. They say that Trump’s refusal to release his tax returns has left the public largely in the dark about the full extent of the potential conflicts. “Turning it over to his family and him still being a recipient of fruits of their labor does create conflicts in my mind,” said Graham, the GOP senator from South Carolina. “It will cloud his presidency if he doesn’t find a solution that puts it behind him. ” Rep. Mark Meadows ( . C.) a member of the House Oversight Committee and the new chairman of the conservative Freedom Caucus, told The Post last week that he expects Trump to divorce himself from the business “as much as you can have a blind trust and fully divest. ” “He has more counselors around him, with plenty of law degrees, that will give him great counsel on how to stay out of trouble,” Meadows said. He added that he expected Trump to build the proper firewall, but that “we have an oversight function that would be appropriate, and from my standpoint I think it’s incumbent upon the Oversight Committee to look at everything without a partisan lens. ” ‘Vigorous oversight’ The chairman of the oversight panel, Rep. Jason Chaffetz ( ) said it was premature to consider any sort of investigation, but he said the committee would provide “vigorous oversight” of the new president. “He’s still a private citizen at this point, though he needs to get his affairs in order,” Chaffetz said. “Give him a little breathing space, I think that’s fair. ” Ethics experts have called for Trump to appoint an independent trustee, unconnected to his family, to lead an effort to sell his assets and reinvest the proceeds without his knowledge. Trump has appeared to brush off concerns about conflicts, noting that there is no legal requirement that he separate. “When I ran, everybody knew that I was a very big owner of real estate all over the world,” Trump told Fox News’s Chris Wallace in an interview that aired Sunday. “I mean, I’m not going to have anything to do with the management of the company. You know, when you sell real estate that’s not like going out and selling a stock. That takes a long time. . . . I’m going to have nothing to with it. And I’ll be honest with you  —   I don’t care about it anymore. ” Trump said he was “turning down billions of dollars of deals” as he prepares to take office. “I’m not going to be doing deals at all,” he said. “Now that would be  —   I don’t even know if that’s a conflict. I mean, I have the right to do it. You know, under the law, I have the right to do it. I just don’t want to do it. I don’t want to do deals, because I want to focus on this. ” Several lawmakers who would be responsible for probing potential conflicts of interest said in recent interviews they are willing to give the incoming president time and space to figure out how he will deal with the situation. “We haven’t even started the next Congress and we haven’t seen exactly how   Trump is going to handle all this,” said Sen. Ron Johnson ( .) who leads the Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee with jurisdiction over investigations. “I’m going to give him and his administration time to figure out what, quite honestly, is a very difficult situation. ” In other corners of the GOP, lawmakers say the calls to investigate Trump are coming primarily from his political opponents. “There are going to be detractors from Trump [who] are going to try to make it sound like all the conflict of interest and all of that, and I don’t think people are really concerned about that except just the activists you run into on the Hill,” said Sen. James M. Inhofe ( . ). “If it’s going to be those who just hate Trump and are looking for something to do him in or lessen his effectiveness  —   that’s not going to happen,” he added.  Rosalind S.

","     Weeks before he takes the oath of office,   Donald Trump is scheduled for another kind of oath  —   he’s set to face lawyers’ questions during a deposition in the $10 million    lawsuit he filed against   celebrity chef José Andrés. In filings last week, attorneys for Trump and Andrés’s company argued over the details of the session slated to take place the first week of January. Trump wanted the deposition to take place in New York, where he lives and where his presidential transition is based, not in Washington, for security reasons. Andrés’s lawyers agreed. But Trump’s team has other objections: The real estate executive wants to limit questioning to two hours and prohibit questions covered in a previous deposition. “It seems dubious that the   cannot be afforded adequate security in the capital of the United States, but defendants are willing to accommodate that demand,” Andrés’s attorneys wrote in a filing. “Defendants cannot, however, accept Trump LLC’s attempt to hamstring defendant’s questioning of the man who directed the bringing of this lawsuit. ”      D. C.    José Andrés says he is backing out of a deal to launch a restaurant in the hotel Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump is building in the historic Old Post Office Pavilion. (WUSA9)   The   legal battle began when the chef backed out of a deal to open a restaurant in Trump’s luxury hotel complex located in the Old Post Office on Pennsylvania Avenue. Andrés cited Trump’s derogatory comments on the campaign trail about illegal immigrants, saying they made it impossible for him to run a successful eatery. Trump promptly sued. Trump was deposed in June in a similar lawsuit against restaurateur Geoffrey Zakarian, who was also slated to run a restaurant in Trump’s Washington hotel and  —   like Andrés  —   scrapped the plan after Trump’s incendiary rhetoric created controversy. Zakarian’s case is apace, too: His attorneys on Monday set a hearing date of Jan. 3 in D. C. Superior Court."

I guess the final numbers are now at 306 —     and she    you know, down to a very low number. No I don’t believe that at all. WALLACE: You say you don’t know why. Do you think that the CIA is trying to overturn the results (CROSSTALK) of the election? TRUMP: No, I don’t think they’re saying anything. WALLACE: Or somehow to weaken you in office? TRUMP: Well, if you look at the story and you take a look at what they said, there’s great confusion. Nobody really knows, and hacking is very interesting. Once they hack if you don’t catch them in the act you’re not going to catch them. They have no idea if it’s Russia or China or somebody. It could be somebody sitting in a bed some place. I mean, they have no idea. WALLACE: So, why would the CIA put out the story that the Russians wanted you to win. TRUMP: Well I’m not sure they put it out. I think the Democrats are putting it out because they suffered one of the greatest defeats in the history of politics in this country. And frankly, I think they’re putting it out. And it’s ridiculous. We ought to get back to making America great again, which is what we’re going to do. And we’ve already started the process. WALLACE: You’ve said repeatedly you don’t believe the intelligence community’s analysis, that the Russians were involved. TRUMP: They’re not sure. They’re fighting among themselves. They’re not sure. WALLACE: But the question is, these are the folks you’re going to have to rely on    TRUMP: Sure. WALLACE:    to know what’s going on in the world.

They have their people, and I have great respect for them. But if you read the stories    the various stories, there’s disputing    I mean, they’re disputing. And certain groups don’t necessarily agree. Personally, it could be Russia. It    I don’t really think it is, but who knows? I don’t know either. They don’t know and I don’t know.

WALLACE:    only once a week. TRUMP: Well,    get it when I need it. WALLACE: But is it    is there some skepticism  —   (CROSSTALK) TRUMP: You know, I get    first of all, these are very good people that are giving me the briefings. And I say, ”If something should change from this point, immediately call me. I’m available on  ’s notice.” I don’t have to be told    you know, I’m, like, a smart person. I don’t have to be told the same thing in the same words every single day for the next eight years. Could be eight years    but eight years. I don’t need that. But I do say, ”If something should change, let us know.” Now, in the meantime, my generals are great    are being briefed. And Mike Pence is being briefed, who is, by the way, one of my very good decisions. He is terrific. And they’re being briefed. And I’m being briefed also. But if they’re going to come in and tell me the exact same thing that they tell me    you know, it doesn’t change, necessarily. Now, there will be times where it might change. I mean, there will be some very fluid situations. I’ll be there not every day, but more than that. But I don’t need to be told, Chris, the same thing every day, every morning    same words. ”Sir, nothing has changed. Let’s go over it again.” I don’t need that. WALLACE: President Obama just ordered a full review of Russia’s involvement    hacking in the election. And Democrats are now calling for hearings. Do you think this is part of an effort to undercut you? TRUMP: Well, it could be. I think President Obama has been terrific. He’s been, you know, very respectful of the process and everything else. So, I saw that. But  —      I want it, too. I think it’s great. I think    well, I don’t want anyone hacking us, and I’m not only talking about countries. I’m talking about anyone, period. But if you’re gonna to do that, I think you should not just say ”Russia.” You should say other countries also, and maybe other individuals. It’s not necessarily just  —   (CROSSTALK) WALLACE: But you think there’s a political effort here. TRUMP: It could be. I mean, it could be. Hey, look. We had    many people are saying    one of the great victories of all time. They’re very embarrassed. CHRIS WALLACE, HOST: We’re calling this program ”The Trump Way,” because I’ve got to tell you, in almost 40 years of covering presidential transitions, I have never seen anything like this. You are setting markers for foreign countries. You’re telling corporations and unions what to do, and you’re not even in office yet. What can we expect when you’re actually the president? DONALD TRUMP,  : My attitude? I want us to make good deals for this country. I don’t need a $4. 2 billion airplane to fly around in, okay? I don’t need that. And especially when it’s totally out of control, because you know, they’ve lost control of it and I let them know that I don’t want this. I just see things that’s so incredible. If you look at the   program with the money, the hundreds of billions of dollars and it’s out of control, and the people that are making these deals for the government, they should never be allowed to go to work for these companies. You know, they make a deal like that and then a year later, or two years later, or three years later you see them working for these big companies that made the deal. I’m going to put a very    you know, lobbyist I’m doing. This is bigger than the lobbyists. When people order from these massive companies, these massive deals, I don’t want the people that are making these horrible, and they’re horrible, deals, the   the cost   I don’t want them going to work for the companies after the deals are made. They should have a lifetime restriction. WALLACE: In the last few days you have named cabinet heads, department agency people, at EPA, at labor, at health and human services, education who are diametrically opposed to what those agencies have been doing for the last eight years. Fair to say that you’re going to take a wrecking ball to the Obama legacy? TRUMP: No. No. No. I don’t want to do that at all. I just want what’s right. EPA, you can’t get things approved. I mean, people are waiting in line for 15 years before they get rejected, okay? That’s why people don’t want to invest in this country. I mean, you look at what’s going on and you can look at a jobs report, but take a look at the real jobs report, which are the millions of people that gave up looking for work, and they’re not considered in that number that’s less than 5 percent, okay? I mean, we have jobs that are in the pipeline and I deal with all the executives, the big ones and the small ones. I have really gotten to know this country and when you have to wait 10 and 15 years for an approval and then you don’t even get the approval, it’s no good. WALLACE: So let me ask    TRUMP: So we’re going to clean it up. We’re going to speed it up and, by the way, if somebody is not doing the right thing we’re not going to approve. WALLACE: Let’s talk about the environment, because in the last week you met with Al Gore and you met with Leo DiCaprio, famous environmentalist. TRUMP: Sure, and they were good meetings. WALLACE: And on the other hand you appointed Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt to be the head of the EPA. TRUMP: Speed up the process. WALLACE: He’s been suing EPA. TRUMP: Sure. WALLACE: At one point in the campaign you said it’s a hoax. TAPE: Donald   Climate   The O’Reilly   December 3, 2015 “I think it’s a big scam for a lot of people to make a lot of money. In the meantime, China is eating our lunch because they don’t partake in all of the rules and regulations that we do. ” (END VIDEO CLIP) WALLACE: On the other hand you told the New York Times that you’re   about it. TRUMP: I am  . WALLACE: So, where are you on the environment? (CROSSTALK) TRUMP: I’m very  . I’m still  . Nobody really knows. Look, I’m somebody that gets it and nobody really knows. It’s not something that’s so hard and fast. I do know this: other countries are eating our lunch. If you look at what China’s doing. If you look at what    I could name country after country. You look at what’s happening in Mexico where our people are just    plants are being built and they don’t wait 10 years to get an approval to build a plant, okay? They build it like the following day or the following week. We can’t let all of these permits that take forever to get stop our jobs. I won because of the fact that people that are great, great American people have been forgotten. I call them the forgotten man and the forgotten woman. They’ve been forgotten. And you, in all fairness, and all of the folks in your world and business you forgot about these people. They’re not going to forget about them in four years. They’re already trying to figure out what happened, but I understood it because I understand our country. WALLACE: Let me ask you a couple of specific questions. Will you still pull out of the Paris Climate Agreement, which has been signed by more than a hundred countries, to reduce carbon emissions. Will you restart the Dakota Access pipeline, which the Army just stopped? TRUMP: Okay. Let me not answer the Dakota, because perhaps that’ll be solved by the time I get there, so I don’t have to create enemies on one side or the other. But I will tell you, when I get to office, if it’s not solved, I’ll have it solved very quickly. WALLACE: Meaning you’re going to start it. TRUMP: I’m not saying anything. I’m just saying, something will happen. It’ll be quick. I think it’s very unfair. So, it’ll start, one way or the other    WALLACE: And Paris? TRUMP:    you’ll have a decision one    pretty quickly. And also, the Keystone pipeline, you’re gonna have a decision fairly quickly. And you’ll see that. Now, Paris, I’m studying. I do say this. I don’t want that agreement to put us at a competitive disadvantage with other countries. And as you know, there are different times and different time limits on that agreement. I don’t want that to give China, or other countries signing agreements an advantage over us. WALLACE: You have already named three retired generals to top positions. Any concern about having too many    TRUMP: No. WALLACE:    military men at the top of your administration? TRUMP: Well, President Obama named three generals also.   you know, these are tremendous people. Sort of    in certain cases, they transitioned into civilian life. But I like generals. I think generals are terrific, you know? They go through schools and they sort of end up at the top of the pyramid. And it’s like a test. They passed the test of life. That’s how they got to be a general, and other people didn’t. So, I sort of like generals. And I like the three that I have very, very much. WALLACE: Have you settled on a Secretary of State? TRUMP: I’m getting very close. I’m getting very, very close. WALLACE: Do you know who it’s going to be? TRUMP: I just have    I have someone in mind that I think will be really fabulous. I think we’re going to have one of the great cabinets ever put together. WALLACE: So, let me ask  —   (CROSSTALK) TRUMP: And we’re getting that kind of review, which is  —   (CROSSTALK) WALLACE: So, let me ask you about Rex Tillerson. TRUMP: Okay. WALLACE: Head of Exxon Mobil. Why does a business executive make sense as the chief diplomat? TRUMP: Well, in his case, he’s much more than a business executive. I mean, he’s a   player. He’s in charge of, I guess the largest company in the world. He’s in charge of   an oil company that’s pretty much double the size of his next serious competitor. It’s been a company that’s been unbelievably managed. And to me, a great advantage is he knows many of the players, and he knows them well. He does massive deals in Russia. He does massive deals for the company    not for himself    for the company. WALLACE: He’s the Secretary of State. TRUMP: No. No. But I have tremendous respect for him. He’s a   player. WALLACE: I’m trying to get you to say  —   (CROSSTALK) TRUMP: But I have others. I know you are WALLACE: [laughs] TRUMP: And you’re doing very well. But I have others, also, that I think    I mean, Bob Corker is a fantastic guy. Mitt Romney    I’ve really gotten to know him, and I get along with him really well. But these are    you know, these are all very different types of people. But when you ask me about Rex, I mean, he’s a   player. There’s no question about it. CHRIS WALLACE, HOST: You recently took a call from the President of Taiwan. And on the Sunday shows, including ours, some of your top aides said, ”Oh, it was just a congratulatory call.” But the next day, some of your top aides said, no, in fact, you had been thinking about this for weeks in advance, to send a message. DONALD TRUMP,  : It’s all wrong    WALLACE: So, which is it? TRUMP: No, no. It’s all wrong. Not weeks. I took a call. I heard the call was coming probably an hour or two before. I fully understand the   policy, but I don’t know why we have to be bound by a   policy unless we make a deal with China having to do with other things, including trade. I mean, look, we’re being hurt very badly by China with devaluation, with taxing us heavy at the borders when we don’t tax them, with building a massive fortress in the middle of the South China Sea, which they shouldn’t be doing, and frankly with not helping us at all with North Korea. You have North Korea. You have nuclear weapons and China could solve that problem and they’re not helping us at all. So, I don’t want China dictating to me and this was a call put into me. I didn’t make the call, and it was a call, very short call saying congratulations, sir, on the victory. It was a very nice call. Short. And why should some other nation be able to say I can’t take a call. I think it actually would’ve been very disrespectful, to be honest with you, not taking it. WALLACE: You recently intervened with Carrier to save about a thousand jobs    TRUMP: Right. WALLACE:    from moving to Mexico and you’ve said at one of your rallies you’re asking for a list of 10 companies that are thinking of outsourcing so you can call them as well. Should the president of the United States be calling companies? I mean, how would you have felt if Barack Obama gets on the phone and says Hey Donald, here’s how I want you to do business? TRUMP: I would’ve been honored. So let me just tell you. WALLACE: Honored? TRUMP: I don’t have to do it myself. I have great people. We have top, top smart people. But it’s so easy to do and we’re going to have to impose a major tax on companies that leave, build their product and think they’re going to sell it right through our border like we’re a bunch of jerks. WALLACE: But what about the free market, sir? TRUMP: That   ’s not free market when they go out and they move and they sell back into our country. WALLACE: But that’s the free market. They made a decision and it makes    TRUMP: No. That’s —  that’s the dumb market, okay? That’s the dumb market. I’m a big free trader, but it has to be fair. So what’s happened is we have lost over a period of years, short years, 70, 000 factories in this country. Chris, 70, 000. I always say to people I think it’s a typo. How could it be so many? Seventy thousand factories. We’re being stripped of our workers. We’re being    I mean, we’re being stripped of our jobs. Our good jobs are really going down, and we’ve got to stop it. And the only way you’re going to stop it, the nice way, is we’re reducing taxes very substantially for companies so they’re not going to have to leave because of taxes. We’ll be reducing regulations. Now those are the nice ways of doing it and everyone loves it and everyone is happy. Business is way down. Also middle class, but way down, the taxes and regulations. But when a company wants to move to Mexico or another company, or another country, and they want to build a nice beautiful factory and they want to sell their product through our border, no tax, and the people that all got fired so we end up with unemployment and debt, and they end up with jobs and factories and all of the other things, it’s not going to happen that way. And the way you stop it is by imposing a tax. Now, I’ve come up with a number of 35 percent. There is no tax if you don’t leave. There is no tax at all. You know, people have said they don’t understand really what I’m doing. I read the Wall Street Journal the other day. Honestly, their editorial board doesn’t get it. I don’t think they understand business. I don’t think the Wall Street Journal editorial board, and I know some of them, they’re really nice. I don’t think they understand business. They don’t understand what I’m saying. There’s a 35 percent tax, but there is no tax if you don’t move. But if you move your plant or factory and you want to sell back into our country, you fire all your people, there are going to be consequences for that. There are going to be consequences. And you know what’s going to happen? WALLACE: What? TRUMP: I’ll tell you. Nobody’s going to move. They’re not going to move. They’re not going to leave. They’re going to stay here. WALLACE: You’re keeping your stake in Celebrity Apprentice. According to the New York Times you’re going to shift operations, but you’re going to keep your stake in your real estate business. TRUMP: Well, essentially I’m not going to have anything to do with the management. WALLACE: I know, but isn’t that a huge conflict of interest, sir? TRUMP: When I ran everybody knew that I was a very big owner of real estate all over the world. I mean, I’m not going to have anything to do with the management of the company. You know, when you sell real estate that’s not like going out and selling a stock. That takes a long time. It takes  —   I   ’m going to have nothing to with it. And I’ll be honest with you    I don’t care about it anymore. That    I’m so focused on doing a great job as president. I don’t care if our rent [inaudible]  well  goes up a little bit or down    I couldn’t care less. WALLACE: But you never    TRUMP: My executives will run it with my children. It’s a big company, it’s a great company. But I’m going to have nothing to do with management. WALLACE: But you hammered Hillary Clinton over the Clinton Foundation and pay    TRUMP: Well, that’s different, because    WALLACE:    and wait    TRUMP:   she was taking massive amounts of money from foreign countries and other things. WALLACE:   and pay to play. TAPE : Donald      23 It is impossible to figure out where the Clinton Foundation ends and the State Department begins. It is now abundantly clear that the Clintons set up a business to profit from public office. (END VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: This is different. WALLACE: Well, wait a minute. You’re going to be making a massive amount of money    TRUMP: No. WALLACE:    wait, wait    TRUMP: What  —   If someone rents    WALLACE:    foreign    TRUMP:    a hotel room? WALLACE: Wait. Foreign countries are already booking events at the Trump Hotel in D. C. You’ve got business operations, deals with foreign countries. TRUMP: Chris, this is all stuff that’s    WALLACE: I mean, isn’t this on    TRUMP:    done    WALLACE:   ’t this on steroids    TRUMP: No. WALLACE: They    TRUMP: No. WALLACE:    foreign interests trying to curry favor with the president of the United States. TRUMP: If I were really going to do new deals right now    I am turning down billions of dollars of deals. I will tell you, running for president    the money I spent is peanuts compared to the money I won’t make, and that’s okay, because this is so important. What I’m doing is so important. This is a calling. This is so    this is a movement. Not just me. It’s millions and millions of people. And you got to see it firsthand. I’m not going to be doing deals at all. Now that would be    I don’t even know if that’s a conflict. I mean, I have the right to do it. You know, under the law, I have the right to do it. I just don’t want to do it. I don’t want to do deals, because I want to focus on this. But, by my not doing deals    I turned down seven deals with one big player, great player, last week, because I thought it could be perceived as a conflict of interest. It was    WALLACE: But your kids are going to be able to do it? TRUMP:    probably a billion dollars of deals that I turned down    WALLACE: But if your kids    TRUMP:    because    WALLACE:    do it, isn’t it going to be the same thing? TRUMP: No. It’s totally different. They’re not president. I mean, they’re not president. But they’re not going to do it either. Oh, I see what you’re getting at. No. They’re not making deals either, for my company. WALLACE: Right. TRUMP: They’re not making deals. And they’re going to run my company    I have a lot of property and great stuff. They’re going to run it. They’re going to run it. Hopefully they’re going to run it properly. I’m sure they’re going to run it properly. But I’m not going to do deals. And I think    you know, I think that’s going to be good. WALLACE: How many times have you spoken to Barack Obama since you were in the Oval Office with him? What do you guys talk about? And has he persuaded you on any of his policies? TRUMP: So, we disagree on things, but we haven’t really discussed things that we disagree on. I’ve spoken to him another time. I’m going to be speaking to him today, actually. He has treated me really well. He’s made us feel very welcome. WALLACE: But on    the Iran nuclear deal, relations with Cuba? TRUMP: Well, I don’t want to tell you what we discussed. But    and some of it I’ve agreed with him. A lot    you know, people don’t read about the stuff that you agree on. But there are things that we disagree on, and probably never going to be able to change that. But we do get along well. I’   I’m surprised at how well we get along, and I think he might say the same thing. I think you’re seeing that from him. WALLACE: Mr.      TRUMP: Thank you. WALLACE:    thank you for your time. TRUMP: Thank you very much."

","           The ”Russian election hacking,” @AmbJohnBolton asks: ”false flag?” Your view? Watch: https:  . . I anchor @Foxnews 4 pm EST.  —   Eric Shawn (@EricShawnTV) December 11, 2016   John Bolton, a former U. N. ambassador reportedly being considered for deputy secretary of state in the Trump administration, said Sunday that reports of Russian interference in the presidential election may be a “false flag” conjured up by the Obama administration. In an interview with Eric Shawn of Fox News, Bolton claimed the Obama administration had “politicized” intelligence and suggested there may have been a hidden motive behind the CIA’s finding that Russians hacked computer networks belonging to the Democratic and Republican national committees. He questioned why the FBI did not uncover similar evidence of meddling by foreign intelligence services when it investigated Hillary Clinton’s private email server. “It’s not at all clear to me just viewing this from the outside that this hacking into the DNC and the RNC computers was not a false flag operation,” Bolton said. “The question that has to be asked is, why did the Russians run their smart intelligence service against Hillary’s server but their dumb intelligence services against the election?”  Bolton’s extraordinary suggestion came after The Washington Post reported Friday that U. S. intelligence agencies concluded Russia intervened in the 2016 presidential race to help Donald Trump win. The CIA shared a secret assessment with key senators during a recent   briefing, telling lawmakers that individuals connected to the Russian government had provided WikiLeaks with thousands of hacked emails from the DNC and others to boost Trump and undermine Clinton, The Post reported. President Obama has ordered a “full review” of suspected Russian hacking during the campaign, and a bipartisan group of senators has called for a probe of the allegations.        Donald Trump as well as Republican and Democratic lawmakers on Dec. 11 reacted to the CIA’s assessment that Russia intervened to help Trump win the election. (Bastien   Washington Post)   The term “false flag,” popular among conspiracy theorists, is typically used to describe a covert attempt by the government to advance an agenda by making it seem like its activities are being carried out by another entity. During his Fox News appearance, Bolton said there should be “very grave consequences” if further investigation showed that Russia did try to influence the presidential election, but he questioned whether a sophisticated foreign intelligence service would leave “cyber fingerprints” after hacking. Shawn asked whether Bolton was accusing the administration or the intelligence community of “trying to throw something. ” “We just don’t know,” Bolton replied. “But I believe that intelligence has been politicized in the Obama administration to a very significant degree. ” Shawn pressed him: “But would the intelligence officials politicize this  —   to go so far to something that could potentially damage the very issue of our republic and what we for   years have stood for?” “I think the whole thing is called into question, which is why the notion of some kind of independent investigation becomes extremely important,” Bolton said. “I do think it’s critical to answer the question I posed: If you think the Russians did this, then why did they leave fingerprints?” Bolton said he was convinced that Russia had “both the capability and the intention of doing it,” but said he did not believe enough facts were available to the public. He also expressed concern about the Obama administration trying to complete its review before Inauguration Day on Jan. 20, 2017. At the end of the interview, Shawn again asked Bolton to address his “false flag” claim, saying “that’s incredibly serious to say that and very disturbing as an American. ” Bolton replied: “We would want to know who else might want to influence the election and why they would leave fingerprints that point to the Russians. That’s why I say, until we know more about how the intelligence community came to this conclusion, we don’t know whether it’s Russian inspired or a false flag. ” In their   briefing, CIA officials told senators that a growing body of evidence from multiple sources made it “quite clear” that Russia wanted to help elect Trump, The Post reported. Administration officials said evidence pointed to Russia’s role in   in at least two states and in hacking emails from the DNC and individuals, according to The Post. “It is the assessment of the intelligence community that Russia’s goal here was to favor one candidate over the other, to help Trump get elected,” a senior U. S. official briefed on the intelligence presentation told The Post. “That’s the consensus view. ”  Trump and his top surrogates dismissed reports of Russian interference in the election in appearances on Sunday’s political talk shows.      CIA officials told senators it is now ”quite clear” that electing Donald Trump was Russia’s goal. In an interview on Fox News Sunday on Dec. 11,   Trump denied the CIA’s assessment. (Victoria   Washington Post)   In an interview with Fox News Sunday, Trump attributed claims of Russian meddling to Clinton supporters and said repeatedly that the intelligence community had “no idea” what happened. “I think it’s ridiculous,” Trump said. “I think it’s just another excuse. I don’t believe it. ” Kellyanne Conway, Trump’s senior adviser and former campaign manager, appeared on CBS’s “Face the Nation,” where she called the notion of Russian interference “laughable and ridiculous” and criticized The Post for using no    sources in its reporting. “He thinks that people are trying to   the election,” Conway said of Trump. Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus, the incoming White House chief of staff to   Trump, made similar remarks on ABC’s “This Week,” saying Clinton “lost because her ideas were bad. ” Trump has been plagued by accusations that he and his team are too cozy with Russia. Trump has said he admires Russian President Vladimir Putin, at one point calling him a stronger leader than President Obama. Trump’s former campaign chairman Paul Manafort resigned over the summer amid scrutiny of his ties to   leaders in Ukraine, and Trump’s likely pick for secretary of state, Exxon chief executive Rex Tillerson, is already drawing fire from some Republican senators over his friendship with Putin and his company’s significant business interests in the country.

","  BEIJING  —   Donald Trump is talking about Taiwan again  —   and so is China, in angry and mocking  comments Monday that questioned whether the   grasps a core  element of  relations between the world’s top economic powers. In an interview broadcast Sunday, Trump said the United States would not necessarily be bound by the   policy  —   the diplomatic understanding that underpins ties between Washington and Beijing and that leaves China’s  rival Taiwan on the diplomatic sidelines with the United States. Trump suggested the policy could be revisited unless America could “make a deal,” potentially on trade between the two countries. The remark elicited a sharp response from Beijing, with the Foreign Ministry expressing “serious concern” and a   newspaper calling the   “as ignorant as a child. ” By appearing to treat Taiwan as just a bargaining chip for trade deals, he may also have irked Taipei, experts said. The comment came less than two weeks after the   made headlines by taking a phone call from Taiwan’s leader, Tsai   a surprise move that was interpreted by some as a     and by others as an overdue show of support for a democratic friend.

","   The arrest in Washington of the “Pizzagate” shooter  —   the North Carolina man who stormed the Comet Ping Pong restaurant in the District, in hopes of exposing a   cabal that fortunately didn’t exist  —   has put “fake news” near the top of things to panic about in the strange new age of Donald Trump. “Fake news” is the name many journalists now use for fabricated   news stories, many of them generated from sites in Eastern Europe and Russia, and the pizzeria scare has encouraged many of them to conclude that     is a threat to the republic. First (the thinking seems to be) this new and creative form of disinformation gave us Trump: All those Facebook stories about Hillary Clinton having Parkinson’s disease and Barack Obama’s closet Islamism poisoned enough minds to turn a presidential election. Now, as if that weren’t bad enough, it’s sending armed lunatics into   pizzerias. Worries about lies in our political life aren’t baseless, to be sure. The Internet teems with these idiotic inventions, especially during election years  —   boxes of fraudulent Clinton votes found in an Ohio warehouse! White House tells Pearl Harbor vets to “get over it”!  —   and they introduce mental havoc into the lives of   people. Fake news is real, yes, but the anxiety it has occasioned in the news media often seems motivated by something other than mere concern for the truth. By agonizing over “fake” news, journalists often appear to blame nameless others for the failings of the widely distrusted news industry. It’s not our fault, some in the media seem to be saying, it’s the fault of some teenage hoaxers in Romania. That modifier “fake,” to put the point slightly differently, suggests that  “fake” news must be conversely genuine, truthful, factual. But of course it isn’t. All of us, whatever our political attitude, have read what we regard as essentially false or inaccurate or wrongheaded stories in mainstream news sources. Does that make the reporters of these stories perpetrators of fake news? Surely not, as they were trying, however imperfectly, to report the truth. That’s not much comfort to the people and institutions these false or inaccurate stories damaged, however, and indeed they are entitled to regard this new term “fake news” with a degree of derision.     Comet Ping Pong customers came out to support the restaurant after a gunman entered it with an assault rifle, firing it at least once. Several other businesses on the block have received other threats as well. (Whitney   Washington Post)   Let’s get at the problem by asking this question: Which is more dangerous  —   the entirely fabricated story your ornery uncle links to on Facebook, or the story we read in a respectable news source containing an important and substantially false claim? The fabricated story that exercises your uncle is dangerous in its way, but it’s unlikely to sway anyone’s opinion about the subject. The only people inclined to believe the hoax headline “FBI Agent Suspected in Hillary Email Leaks Found Dead in Apparent  ” are those who already loathe Clinton. The story may intensify hatred, but it doesn’t alter opinion or allegiance. The false or inaccurate story published in a mainstream venue, by contrast, does the opposite. Maybe the story consists of mostly true statements, but it’s built on an egregiously false premise. Or maybe it includes a key line that infers far more than the facts allow. Or it presents a tendentious interpretation of the facts. Take this sentence, published last week in the New York Times about House Republicans breaking with Trump over the latter’s trade policies. “He [Trump] repeatedly insisted that trade deals had displaced American workers and harmed the economy, upending two centuries of American economic policies that held trade up as a good thing, a position that Republicans have pushed in recent decades. ” The latter half of the sentence (a) implies that Trump opposes, not just disadvantageous trade deals, but trade itself; and (b) suggests that American policy has unswervingly favored free trade for 200 years. Both are false, but the uncareful reader may easily imbibe one or both without realizing it, so subtle is the misinformation and so authoritative the source. I don’t know the reporter’s views, but the article’s tone leads me to suspect that a dislike of Trump gave her license to interpret his pronouncements in the worst possible light, even at the cost of sense and factual truth. And that  —   the   danger of allowing our likes and dislikes to dictate our interpretations of facts  —   may be what mainstream journalists preoccupied with “fake news” haven’t yet appreciated. The facile and stark distinction between real and fake, fact and invention, truth and lie suggests a failure on the part of mainstream American journalists to grasp the importance of interpretation. There is no such thing as an uninterpreted fact, and journalists are just as much interpreters as reporters of facts. Indeed I suspect one of the chief reasons so many Americans prefer harrowing Internet rumors to mainstream news is that they’ve grown impatient with journalists’ pretense that their assertions involve only truth, only facts unmediated by opinion or partiality. These Americans may have their gullible moments, but they know better than that. The rise of fake news, if it’s anything, is an indictment of America’s newsrooms. Yet somehow I doubt the newsrooms will interpret it that way.    Read more here:   Ruth Marcus: When all news is ‘fake,’ whom do we trust?   Robert G. Parkinson: Fake news? That’s a very old story.

","     On a trip to Germany this month, the deputy head of the Turkish parliament and a close ally of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan had her purse and passport stolen from a hotel lobby. After filing a complaint with the police, she was taken to the police station at the airport, where she waited alongside illegal immigrants and suspects and faced what she described as “humiliating” behavior at the hands of German police before being allowed to board a plane to Turkey. The Turkish politician was furious, but not nearly as much as the Turkish president, who threatened “retaliation. ” The German ambassador was subsequently summoned to the foreign ministry in Ankara, and Turkey briefly detained four German diplomats on their way home. This just happened to be the “scandal of the week” in Turkey’s volatile relationship with Europe  —   but it also summed up all key aspects of this difficult partnership: the humiliation Turks feel at each encounter with Europe, the   European behavior that doesn’t understand Turkey’s cultural norms, the wait, the resentment, the fury and finally settling for an uncomfortable modus vivendi. A decade ago, Turkey was a promising candidate to join the European Union and undertook major reforms to elevate its democracy to European standards. In the    atmosphere, the decision to start membership talks with Turkey was a momentous strategic move for the West  —   integrating a large Muslim country into a club based on democracy and Western values. Europeans call the sum of these values “Copenhagen criteria,” and Turkey started negotiations for “full membership” in 2005 after Europeans ruled that it had “sufficiently fulfilled the Copenhagen criteria. ” But along the way, Europeans had a change of heart, Turks stalled, and public resentment grew on both sides.   to today, and the relationship is looking more like a messy divorce than an alliance. This week, European leaders are meeting to discuss the fate of their union, the arrival of Donald Trump and the future of relations with Turkey. The Dec. 15 summit is coming on the heels of a vote from the European Parliament to “freeze” the already moribund membership talks with Turkey based on its human rights record. A decade ago, the European Parliament was an enthusiastic supporter of Turkey; today it’s the main advocate for shunning it. While it is true that Erdogan’s Turkey is a far cry from the reformist Muslim democracy it was a decade ago  —   undoubtedly more repressive, authoritarian and Islamic in character  —   European leaders should think twice before severing ties with Turkey. There are ample reasons for this. First, Turkey’s domestic evolution was always meant to be a   project. Even though the setbacks  —   which the Europeans politely refer to as “democratic backsliding”  —   are obvious, there is also a    component to Turkey’s downturn, and Europe deserves at least part of the blame. Even before Ankara turned authoritarian, Europeans had already pretty much shut the door on Turkey  —   no new accession chapters opened since 2010, and leaders such as Angela Merkel and Nicolas Sarkozy had already signaled they would not allow Turkey’s membership. What we will never know is this: Would Erdogan have become so wayward if there was a real possibility of entering the Euro club?  Another strong argument to keep Turkey’s membership bid alive is Turkey itself  —   the country as opposed to the leader. Hop on a subway or walk the streets of Istanbul and you will see thousands of young men and women going to work and school  —   looking or acting no different than their European counterparts. It is a very polarized society, and in that mix, Turkey’s   and secular constituency is not a tiny minority but roughly half of Turkey. That half should not be ignored. Even though Erdogan has emerged as a bête noire for European public opinion, European leaders could explain to their electorate that Turkey is not just about Erdogan. And then there is the problem of the big bad wolves out there. No one knows the future shape of the European Union after Brexit, after the string of European elections in 2017 favoring populist  . U. parties or the possible damage that could be inflicted on the continent at the hands of a   Trump administration. With his tightening grip on Syria, promise of lucrative energy deals and a glittering membership card to the Authoritarian International, Vladimir Putin is already out there trying to lure Erdogan into his own universe. Such a realignment between Turkey and Russia would be a huge loss for the West. Turkey’s capricious leader is difficult and confused, but Europe should not push him into Russia’s arms. It is tempting for European countries to yell back at Erdogan, tear up Turkey’s contract and reduce its   E. U. bid to a simple    deal  —   asking Turkey to keep Syrian refugees in return for cash payments from Brussels. But leaders must resist that. Between “full membership” and severing ties, there is a whole range of associations that could salvage the relationship  —   such as upgrading Turkey’s existing   agreement with the E. U. or, for a change, building direct bridges with Turkish society. What Europe really needs is a   strategic vision, in the words of Carl Bildt, “strategic patience” in relations with Turkey. Ten years from now, Turkey could look a lot more appealing to Europe than it does today. Europeans have not lived up to their end of the bargain to help Turkey’s domestic evolution; they cannot abandon it now. Having some type of a European peg would only help the country return to democracy. And in the end, that seems like the only good option."
142213,217617,Has Donald Trump exposed the liberal academic cocoon?,Washington Post,Daniel W. Drezner,2016-12-12,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161213000618/https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2016/12/12/has-donald-trump-exposed-the-liberal-academic-cocoon/
","     It’s the day after a Nick Kristof column in the New York Times about the academy, which means I have to write about it. A few years ago when Kristof argued that the academy had marginalized itself from larger public policy debates, I took issue with his claims. This time around Kristof is arguing that the academy’s insularity has led to the creation of a political echo chamber, and the 2016 election outcome is the proof: I share apprehensions about   Trump, but I also fear the reaction was evidence of how insular universities have become. When students inhabit liberal bubbles, they’re not learning much about their own country. To be fully educated, students should encounter not only Plato, but also Republicans. . . . I fear that liberal outrage at Trump’s presidency will exacerbate the problem of liberal echo chambers, by creating a more hostile environment for conservatives and evangelicals. Already, the lack of ideological diversity on campuses is a disservice to the students and to liberalism itself, with liberalism collapsing on some campuses into  . . . . Of course, we shouldn’t empower racists and misogynists on campuses. But whatever some liberals think, “conservative” and “bigot” are not synonyms. Kristof is only the latest and most liberal writer to use Trump as an intellectual hatchet designed to expose the rot in the ivory tower. George F. Will did this last month, concluding, “Institutions of supposedly higher education are awash with hysteria, authoritarianism, obscurantism, philistinism and charlatanry. Which must have something to do with the tone and substance of the presidential election, which took the nation’s temperature. ” Conservative students are also starting to articulate their   thoughts about how tough life has been.   students are telling the New York Times about their need for “safe spaces. ” Even at the Fletcher School, my home institution, conservative student Frances Tilney Burke wrote an essay in the Weekly Standard decrying her own marginalization: When I arrived at school on Wednesday morning after the big Clinton crash, it was like I was entering a funeral home. People were huddled in groups, whispering, comforting each other, crying. (There was even a cuddly dog to pat.) Others were angrily plotting revenge: How do we start community organizing so that Trump racism, Trump sexism, and overall Trump badness does not permeate our rosy lives? Quick! Attach a safety pin to your shirt; this will signal your righteousness. If you wear a safety pin, you, personally, are a “safe space. ” Or you believe in safe spaces. Or you will harbor other people in your safe space. What I would like to know, is where is my safe space? At my university, I am very wary of admitting my political party. I don’t particularly feel comfortable discussing my Catholicism (not   Catholicism, but the normal kind). When I tell classmates that I used to work for Paul Wolfowitz (and I loved every minute of that job) their eyes grow wide and I see them surreptitiously looking at my hairline for the nubs of my devil horns. Now would ordinarily be the moment in Spoiler Alerts when I would push back on these columns as further examples of the War on College. To be honest, however, I don’t disagree with too much of what was quoted above. Burke’s description of the Fletcher School the day after the election is  . Will is correct to point out that higher education was the primary fault line of the 2016 electorate. And Kristof is right when he says that the academy, always   has trended further left in recent decades.      Hundreds of high school students in Berkeley and Oakland, Calif. walked out of class on Nov. 9 to protest Donald Trump’s victory in the presidential election. Students along with their teachers at Berkeley High, Bishop O’Dowd High, and Oakland Technical High School all staged morning walkouts. (Reuters)   When it comes to critiquing the academy, however, sometimes a little local knowledge is a good thing. And it’s worth pointing out that the 2016 election might not be the best example to use of academic  . If 2016 had produced the standard liberal vs. conservative presidential race, I’d understand the cocooning claim. But in contrast to the 2012 or 2008 presidential elections, conservative academics  —   they do exist  —   were not exactly Trump enthusiasts. Sure, there were a few conservative scholars who supported Trump, but even his boosters had their reservations. A month before the election, conservative scholar Mark Bauerlein made the case for Trump in Vox, and even he had to acknowledge Trump’s “raunchy braggadocio. ” A fair number of Republican writers and scholars came out in opposition to Trump. As Ross Douthat noted a month before the election, “The Republican Party’s politicians have mostly surrendered to Donald Trump. The Republican Party’s entertainers have mostly been enthusiastic about his candidacy. But the conservative intelligentsia  —   journalists,   and academics  —   has been conspicuous in its resistance. ” What made 2016 unusual wasn’t the vilification of the GOP nominee by liberal academics  —   that’s par for the course, and a topic that Kristof, Will, et al. are right to raise. What made 2016 unusual was that conservative intellectuals were equally appalled by Trump. It’s not surprising that students, who tend to take intellectuals seriously, were shocked by the election outcome. As for the reaction at Fletcher, I would gently suggest to Burke that the   Day blues weren’t primarily about ideological homogeneity. More than 40 percent of Fletcher’s students come from outside the United States. A candidate who took great delight in denigrating Mexicans and proposing an outright ban on Muslims entering the country had just won the election. Being in graduate school is supposed to be about being exposed to different points of view, so it might behoove Burke to imagine what international students must have inferred after the election outcome. Trump’s potentially disastrous effect on one of America’s leading export sectors is a topic for another day. But going forward, the concerns of Kristof et al. are worth remembering. It seems ever more apparent that Trump is grafting the traditional conservative apparatus into his government. Which means that traditional ideological fault lines are likely to reemerge. All I ask is that critics of the academy not use the 2016 election as an exemplar of liberal cocooning in the academy. Because it wasn’t."

"," “Watch what we do, not what we say. ” At the beginning of Richard Nixon’s presidency, that’s how Attorney General John Mitchell explained the way reporters could best understand what the country was about to experience. It’s also good advice for understanding the administration of the billionaire phony populist who will assume the presidency next month. Donald Trump cast himself as the champion of a besieged American working class and a defender of its interests. His early decisions tell us something very different: This could be the most     crowd to run our government since the Gilded Age. There’s an irony here, in that Mitchell was trying to reassure journalists that despite Nixon’s 1968    campaign, he would stay true to enforcing civil rights laws. In Trump’s case, we’re learning that rhetoric out of labor songbooks meant less than nothing. He was covering up an agenda focused on undercutting legal protections for workers and weakening their   organizations. How else to understand Trump’s decision to nominate Andrew Puzder, a   executive, as secretary of labor? Perhaps, in the interests of transparency, the incoming Republican Congress can rename the part of our government historically devoted to workers’ interests the “Department of   Labor. ”       Donald Trump is nominating   executive Andrew Puzder as secretary of labor. Here’s what you need to know about him. (Sarah Parnass, Osman Malik, Danielle Kunitz, Adriana   Washington Post)   The contradictions abound. One of Trump’s core promises was to restore   jobs in the factories and the mines. But he’s putting at the helm of the Labor Department the chief executive of the company that franchises Hardee’s and Carl’s Jr. Their workers tend to be at the bottom end of the pay scale. Puzder’s passions have been invested in cutting wage costs. If Trump wanted a corporate type at Labor, might he at least have tried to pick someone from the manufacturing sphere? Ah, but Trumpworld is also a land of cronies. Trump and the Republican Party could not say enough about the “corrupt” intersection of donors to the Clinton Foundation and the policies that Hillary Clinton would pursue as president. Yet here comes Puzder  —   joining a Cabinet of working stiffs with a net worth so far of $14. 5 billion, according to NBC News  —   who will no doubt feel well rewarded for his own financial support of the Trump campaign. A rule of thumb for the next four years: With Trump, everything that Republicans said about corruption and conflicts of interest where Clinton was concerned is now, to use the   word, inoperative. The labor secretary is responsible for enforcing laws that protect employees. But as New York State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman noted, “the fact that Mr. Puzder has now reportedly been selected to lead the same agency that uncovered wage theft at his restaurants is a cruel and baffling decision by   Trump. ” How closely will the   Senate look into this issue? And you get a clear sense of how   Trump threatens to be when you combine the Puzder pick with Trump’s attack on Chuck Jones. He’s the president of the United Steelworkers Local 1999, which represents workers at the Carrier plant in Indiana where Trump claimed he saved 1, 100 jobs. Jones used colorful language to say that Trump had “lied” about the number of jobs protected and had given Carrier workers “false hope. ” The real jobs number was closer to 800, and layoffs are expected in 2017. Jones was quickly assailed by Trump (on Twitter, of course) for having “done a terrible job representing workers. ” Further, Trump blamed the union for the job losses. “If United Steelworkers 1999 was any good, they would have kept those jobs in Indiana. ” Trump likes to talk about workers but hates it when they talk back. Jones, tougher than Trump when it comes to absorbing criticism, shrugged off the  ’s tantrum, saying Trump didn’t know “what in the hell he’s talking about. ”  But the rest of us  —   and particularly workers who cast ballots for Trump in the hope of better days  —   ignore the   ’s behavior at our peril. Fake populism is an old story, and it often involves dividing workers against each other along the lines of race, religion, ethnicity or immigration status. Trump has already proved himself a master of this sort of manipulation.  Over the long run, though, workers will rely on the content of their paychecks and the quality of their living standards to help them decide whether Trump’s word to them was any better than his promises to the students he fleeced at Trump University. They won’t need John Mitchell to tell them to keep a close eye on what this man actually does.  Read more from E. J.

","     Last week, Corey Lewandowski declared victory in the War on Christmas. “Merry Christmas,” he told Sean Hannity, “which you can say again because Donald Trump is now the president. You can say it again! It’s okay to say  —   it’s not a pejorative word anymore. ” Across the country, on a million radios, sleigh bells began ringing out in triumph. (They had been ringing, intermittently, since weeks before Thanksgiving, but they rang all the same.) The “s” struggling to hang on at the end of “Happy Holidays” fell, exhausted, and was trampled beneath thousands of tiny, pawing, prancing reindeer hooves. Happy Christmas. War is over. Perhaps now the assault will cease. Christmas can cease its constant displays of strength, with platoons of Christmas trees on every corner, bells ringing every which where, Starbucks cups bristling in every hand and the menacing bellow of Bing Crosby blasting from every loudspeaker in all public places. At long last, the constant radio and television broadcasts informing us that “Santa is watching, Santa is coming” can cease. “DO THEY KNOW IT’S CHRISTMAS?” Yes. They know. We all know. Those sinister elves can be removed from the shelves. The war is over. Send these agents of enforced compliance home. Each year the assaults started sooner. Dickens was not enough. There were whole TV channels devoted exclusively to psychological warfare, telling the cautionary tales of Elderly Misers or Busy Men and Women Like You Who Did Not Believe in Christmas and the various horrible things that happened to them  —   including, but not limited to, stalled cars, lost cats, unforced breakups, inexplicable firings and threats of lonely deaths and eternal damnation  —   before they were rescued at the last minute by the Spirit of the Holiday, to which they pledged allegiance for the rest of their days. Christmas, in these stories, always won. That was the only way. Even things that had not originally belonged to Christmas became a part of it. “The Sound of Music. ” “Die Hard. ” It took everything. It gave nothing back. I cannot remember a time when Christmas was not at war with us, when “Happy Holidays” and “Season’s Greetings” did not have to be whispered in a low, conspiratorial tone lest the Elf on the Shelf  —   or worse, a Fox News correspondent  —   might hear us. Christmas, we knew, would not rest until it controlled the whole calendar. We watched the red and green spread deeper and deeper into November, then October, with a creeping sense of horror. But now that is over. Halloween can emerge from its defensive crouch in a bunker, where it has been ever since the shot over the bow of “The Nightmare Before Christmas” hit movie theaters. Thanksgiving, which gave up somewhere in 2011, stabbed through the heart with a sprig of mistletoe, can creep back out of hiding and see what is left of its former home. Hanukkah can stop disguising itself as Columbus Day and start to rebuild. The warlike Nativity scenes that had been inching their camels and Wise Men closer and closer to the single illuminated menorah in a threatening manner can rest. The war is over. Or the resistance has ended, which is much the same. The whole nation now is forced to honor and celebrate an elderly man with pink cheeks who flies from one place to another in an idiosyncratic private conveyance and depends heavily on the understanding that he will not compensate his labor. We see signs of him in many yards. But he has promised to deliver coal to some people, so we must tolerate him. Seems about right. Stay tuned for the next bulletin from the front lines of this conflict, proclaiming definitively that Santa is white."

"," Just listen to those crickets. A conspicuous hush is emanating from the NFL office on the subject of those soft footballs the New York Giants retrieved from the field against the Pittsburgh Steelers last week. Where was the outrage, the treating of   and     as more serious than a hijacking? Compare the screams of scandal NFL executives emitted toward Tom Brady and the New England Patriots to this smothered,     reaction. It’s a guilty silence, and it leaves NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell beached and exposed. Goodell has always struggled with the demands of speech, but his wordlessness in this instance has nothing to do with competence but rather dishonesty. Any serious examination of those footballs from the   game might well show that Goodell owes the Patriots and Brady an apology and material recompense. Which is exactly why the league is shutting the matter down and shutting it down now.  When the Giants tested air pressure on two footballs they captured against the Steelers and reported them to be below the permissible range of 12. 5 PSI, league officials should have leaped into action. They should have told Steelers officials, “You’re in big        trouble” and then leaked erroneous   data that poisoned the public understanding. They should have triggered a massive   investigation, complete with footnoted junk science, that tarred a future Hall of Famer and resulted in fines, a forfeited draft pick and a   suspension. They should have invoked the words “scheme” and “tamper” and “cheating” and “competitive integrity,” even compared the offense to “  drugs. ”  Instead? Nothing. NFL execs were neither overwhelmed nor underwhelmed by the report of soft footballs. They weren’t whelmed at all. Instead there was this throbbing stillness. Followed by an attempt at denial and misdirection. After Jay Glazer of Fox Sports broke the news that the Giants had gone to the league with measurements showing loss of air pressure, the NFL replied with a   yet ducking statement: “The officiating game ball procedures were followed and there were no chain of command issues. All footballs were in compliance and no formal complaint was filed by the Giants with our office. ” Ahhhhh. No “formal” complaint. As opposed to that    complaint lodged against the Patriots during the 2015 AFC championship game, when Indianapolis Colts General Manager Ryan Grigson stuck his head into the NFL suite and bawled, “We’re playing with a small ball. ” Which set off the most infamously ludicrous investigation in league history. The league would have you think there is nothing to see here, that they never received PSI data from the Giants that might be exculpatory for the Patriots. Move along, folks. But Giants Coach Ben McAdoo blew the cover story when he admitted Sunday night that the Giants had in fact tested two balls and found them soft. “I don’t know, the PSIs were a little low, so they checked them, and they just let me know they checked them,” he said. Pro Football Talk’s Mike Florio came along with a sourced report that one ball had measured 11. 4 and another 11. 8. Glazer reaffirmed that the Giants indeed “alerted” the league about the balls. Now, there are two things to take from this. The first is obvious. You don’t need a legion of scientists and lawyers to know what anyone with a car knows: Cold weather causes air pressure to drop in footballs, the same as it does in your tires. The only people who don’t know that are hermetically sealed in Park Avenue offices and only travel by soft shoe and NFL limo. If Steelers footballs were underinflated, the most likely explanation is not that someone deflated them by hand but that the game was played in temperatures in the low 40s, with a wind chill of 28. Just as natural deflation is the most likely explanation for what happened in the AFC title game, when the Patriots’ balls measured an average of 11. 3 in wet, even colder weather.   The second point is less obvious: Somebody from the New York Giants stuck a needle into two footballs during a game last week to measure them. Which tells you that the NFL’s   procedures are not being followed, even now. But the NFL doesn’t want to get into that. If it admits it received info from the Giants about low PSI, then it has to admit that maybe weather affected the inflation of footballs in other games, too.  It has to admit that league officials lacked command of   science and that Goodell raced to judgment. It has to admit that a few whiffs of PSI aren’t a   factor, much less worth serious penalties. It has to admit that Goodell is not willing to pursue Art Rooney and Ben Roethlisberger over the air in a couple of footballs with the same energy. It has to admit that Deflategate was not a fair process but just a   excuse to punish the Patriots in order to satisfy owner envy and internal politics. It has to admit that it has been covering up PSI data in order to save the last rags of Goodell’s shredded reputation. It has to admit that the NFL under this commissioner has zero credibility left.

It doesn’t see such warm temperatures in the summer  —   yet  —   and so its ice tends to remain more pristine. “Many people refer to East Antarctica as being too cold for significant melt,” says Jan Lenaerts, a glaciologist with the Utrecht University in the Netherlands. “I mean there’s marginal melt in summer, but there’s not a lot. ”  That’s the common wisdom, at least, but it is challenged in a new study in Nature Climate Change, by Lenaerts and his colleagues from universities in the Netherlands, Belgium, and Germany. They do so based on research they conducted atop the very large Roi Baudouin ice shelf in East Antarctica, which floats atop the ocean, and where they found a very   situation in early 2016. The researchers had traveled to investigate what had been described as a nearly 2 mile wide “crater” in the shelf, glimpsed by satellite, which some sources believed had been caused by a meteorite. To the contrary, they found that it was a large, 10 foot deep, icy lake bed. In its center, meanwhile, were multiple rivers and three moulins that carried water deep down into the floating ice shelf. And even this, perhaps, was not the most dramatic finding. The researchers also drilled through the ice and found what they called “englacial” lakes, sandwiched between the surface of the ice shelf and its base, which is in contact with the ocean beneath it. They found 55 lakes in total on or in the ice shelf, and a number of them were in this buried, englacial format. The video of one such discovery, of a crystal blue lake four meters below the ice shelf surface, is shown above, and an image from the video is below:    Underwater picture of englacial lake 4m below the surface of the Roi Baudouin ice shelf, East Antarctica. (Photo by Stef Lhermitte)  This meant that the ice shelf is anything but solid  —   it had many large pockets of weakness throughout its structure, suggesting a greater potential vulnerability to collapse through a process called “hydrofracturing,” especially if lake formation continues or increases. That’s bad news because when ice shelves fall apart, the glacial ice behind them flows more rapidly to the ocean, raising sea levels. But why was all this happening, and here? The researchers postulate that a “microclimate” exists on the ice shelf that made it all possible  —   and that a similar mechanism is operating on other East Antarctic ice shelves. Here’s what they believe happens to create so much wetness and melt:    Animation showing the processes causing the warm   on the ice shelf. (Credit: Stef Lhermitte)  In East Antarctica,   “katabatic” winds blow downhill from higher reaches of the ice sheet toward the sea. These powerful winds scour the surface and lift off all the snow, exposing blue ice beneath. At the same time, they mix with warmer air higher in the atmosphere and pull it downward. (In this part of Antarctica there is a temperature “inversion” with cooler winds near the surface and warmer air aloft.) This has a double melting effect: The warmth raises temperatures atop the ice, even as the exposure of the blue ice reduces the “albedo,” or reflectivity, of the surface, meaning that more sunlight gets absorbed. The result is a pocket of melt in the form of a lake and in some cases the pouring of water into the ice shelf. As for the submerged lakes, these appear to form from surface lakes that freeze over on top in winter, but stay liquid beneath, Lenaerts said. Then subsequent layers of snow may bury them, even as the steady flow of the glacier into the ice shelf carries them out further over the ocean. Indeed, it turns out that the further out over the ocean you go, the deeper the lakes tended to occur, presumably due to this flow and burial process. The lake in the video above is four meters below the ice surface, but “we have found one 8 meters below the surface even further, and one 15 meters below the surface, even further,” Lenaerts said. As for the plunging moulins, where that water ends up remains mysterious. But it does not appear to be feeding the buried lakes. “We don’t have the tools, the instrumentation, to detect this right now. This is a really big unknown,” Lenaerts said. The water could even be traveling all the way through the ice shelf and pouring into the ocean.    Moulin inside the crater on the Roi Baudouin ice shelf showing the drainage of meltwater (photo by Sanne Bosteels).  Importantly, the researchers went to satellite images to show that what’s happening on the Roi Baudouin ice shelf isn’t unique to East Antarctica. Rather, they say, they have seen similar features atop other nearby East Antarctic ice shelves, at least remotely. “We see similar things going on on neighboring ice shelves, and also for instance on the Amery ice shelf, which is also a notorious, very large ice shelf on East Antarctica,” Lenaerts said. “We see this link between strong winds and blue ice formation, enhanced absorption of solar radiation, and the melt that is enhanced by this process. ” The researchers are not saying, to be sure, that these processes are caused by   climate change  —   they note in particular that on the Roi Baudouin shelf, it appears that there has been some melting at the surface since the 1980s. However, Lenaerts said it is already clear that there is much more meltwater during warmer summers than in cooler ones. And global warming will gradually produce warmer Antarctic temperatures, which should increase the volume of meltwater atop of these ice shelves, pushing them still further in the Greenland direction. What this means is that the shelves could be subject to the risk of what researchers call “ ”: When a great deal of meltwater forms atop the shelf and pushes inside of it, eventually leading to a crackup. That’s what’s believed to have happened in the classic case of the shattering of the Larsen B ice shelf in the Antarctic peninsula in 2002. Now the fear is that it could happen in the East Antarctic, too, where there is a massive amount of ice to potentially lose. “If this region can get warmer in the future, the meltwater production will enhance a lot, and we can only expect these features, these processes to be more present than they are now,” said Lenaerts said. “With potential implications for hydrofacturing to happen and for ice shelf stability. ” Read more at Energy & Environment: Trump names Scott Pruitt, Oklahoma attorney general suing EPA on climate change, to head the EPA Atmospheric levels of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas, are spiking, scientists report Trump transition team for Energy Department seeks names of employees involved in climate meetings For more, you can sign up for our weekly newsletter here and follow us on Twitter here."

","     The 2017 Golden Globe nominations are in, and yes, “La La Land” and the FX series “The People v. O. J. Simpson” predictably lead the motion picture and television pack.  But, inevitably, the Hollywood Foreign Press Association managed to serve up some surprising nods and snubs for the awards show, which serves as an Oscars predictor. Here’s a look: TV shows that once got love get passed over After two consecutive years of getting nominations, HBO’s “Silicon Valley” didn’t nab one in the best TV series, comedy. “Mr. Robot” won best drama TV series last year, but didn’t even get nominated this year. Rami Malek did score a nomination for best actor in a drama TV series, and Christian Slater received one for his supporting role. “Orange is the New Black” got completely passed over this year after a critically acclaimed season; the Netflix series has earned six nominations between 2014 and 2016.  And after three years of earning nominations and wins, “House of Cards” got nothing this year.      Movies like ”La La Land” and ”Moonlight” are becoming Golden Globe darlings as expected, but new TV shows like ”Stranger Things” are also on the 2017 nomination list. (Nicki   Washington Post)   “This Is Us” and other TV surprises Epix got into the original programming game this year with the political comedy “Graves,” and Nick Nolte just received a best actor in a comedy nomination for his role. Yes, Nick Nolte. NBC’s sleeper hit “This Is Us” is an audience favorite  —   and earned three nominations, including two in best supporting actress in a series. “The Americans” didn’t get a nod for best drama, but the FX series finally broke its Golden Globe nomination drought with acting nods for Keri Russell and Matthew Rhys.    Keri Russell as Elizabeth Jennings and Matthew Rhys as Philip Jennings in “The Americans. ” (Craig  )  “Sing Street” One of this year’s biggest surprises came in the best   category. This John   Irish film, set in 1980s Dublin, earned just $3. 2 million at the box office. But it was an audience favorite  —   among those who actually saw it. “Silence” This passion project from Martin Scorsese, who reliably gets recognized, was completely shut out this year, including in the director category. While there was plenty of speculation over whether his “Silence” would get released in time for awards season, it apparently didn’t end up mattering when it came to the Golden Globes. There’s always the Oscars?  “Hell or High Water” The summer sleeper hit received both best screenplay and best drama nominations, edging out “Silence” and other   releases. Jeff Bridges predictably scored one for supporting actor.  “Nocturnal Animals” This Tom Ford psychological thriller did surprisingly well, earning best director and best screenplay nominations. Also, Aaron   earned one for best supporting actor; Michael Shannon, another supporting actor in the film, had been considered a favorite.    Amy Adams stars as Susan Morrow in “Nocturnal Animals. ” (Merrick   Features)  “Jackie” Unsurprisingly, Natalie Portman got a best actress nomination. But the competition was too tough for it to fit into other categories; the film about Jackie Kennedy in the days after John F. Kennedy’s death was considered on the cusp for the screenplay, directing and best drama categories.  “Finding Dory” Pixar movies are typical awards favorites, but this year’s competition was just too tight. While “Finding Dory” was passed over, “Zootopia” and “Moana”  —   from sister company Walt Disney Animation Studio movies  —   got nods.  Tom Hanks He may have just earned a Presidential Medal of Freedom, but Tom Hanks won’t be walking away with any Golden Globes this year. “Sully” didn’t earn any nominations, including for best actor in a drama.  “Loving” Leads Ruth Negga and Joel Edgerton earned a best actress and best actor nomination. But this understated film that follows Richard and Mildred Loving, the interracial couple who fought for the right to be married, didn’t get any other nominations, including for best motion picture in a drama.    Alano Miller as Raymond, Terri Abney as Garnet, Ruth Negga as Mildred, and Joel Edgerton as Richard in Jeff Nichols’s “Loving. ” (Ben   Features)  “Fences” Denzel Washington and Viola Davis both received acting nominations, but Washington didn’t get one for directing. And the movie, based on the 1983 August Wilson play, didn’t receive nominations for best screenplay or best drama."

","     President Obama has been determining what he’ll work on once he leaves the White House and now he has a place to do it. Obama has agreed to lease office space in the headquarters building of the World Wildlife Fund, at 1250 24th St. NW in the West End, according to two people familiar with the agreement. They spoke on the condition of anonymity because the deal has not been announced publicly. WWF, a nonprofit organization focused on environmental conservation, owns the building and leases excess space to other organizations. “As a former president, President Obama will have office space in Washington, D. C. when he leaves office,” said Amy Brundage, an Obama spokeswoman. She declined to confirm or identify the office’s location. WWF did not return a request seeking comment. While much of Obama’s   House focus will be based in Chicago, where he is designing his presidential library and will be building out a center that will promote leadership and other public priorities, he will also engage in other activities. One of them will entail supporting the National Democratic Redistricting Committee, which will pursue redistricting efforts to boost Democratic candidates across the country.

","     After 35 years on the job, Michael Stuban was minutes away from retiring from the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission. Only one thing stood in his way: emailing his exit questionnaire to the Human Resources Department. Stuban had already decided to use the questionnaire to get a few things off his chest, penning a brutally frank assessment of his colleagues and bosses and how they functioned inside the   agency. Now, the    stood at a crossroads. To the left was the nicely paved road to the HR Department, to which Stuban could quietly send his scathing critique, like a good   employee to the very end. To the right was a rockier but far more adventurous path known as the “reply all” button. On this route, Stuban could live out the fantasy of disgruntled workers everywhere, ending his career in a blaze of glory, essentially yelling “Sayonara, suckers!” at the top of his lungs  —   his name forever infamous. Did Stuban’s finger linger over his mouse as he decided which route to take and which man to become as he entered the next phase in his life? Perhaps we’ll never know. What we do know is that Stuban boldly chose the road less traveled. Seconds later, his   missive landed in the inboxes of 2, 000 fellow employees. Weeks later, during an interview with the Philadelphia Daily News, Stuban, who retired on Thanksgiving Day, seemed to be at peace with his decision. “When they asked for an honest exit interview, I gave them one,” he told the newspaper. “I sent it minutes before I officially retired. ” Calls to Stuban and his former employer were not immediately returned.  In his questionnaire, Stuban said, rather surprisingly, that he actually enjoyed his job, according to a copy of the questionnaire published by PennLive. “I really didn’t want to retire yet,” he wrote. “I like my job. The first 30 years were great but the last 5 years are terrible. (10 years as a toll collector, during which I served a few years as a union officer, 25 years in management). ” Asked in the questionnaire what the most upsetting part of the job was, Stuban unloaded. “The phoneyness,” he wrote. “Giving us classes where we are being told we are not political,” he wrote. “That’s    .   are filled by the politicians, it’s who you know, not what you know. Positions created for people who are not qualified. Hiring people off the street when we have qualified [personnel] in our ranks. ” Stuban also claimed that commission employees “have no morale” and that   management is “out of touch with the average employees” and “only looking out for themselves. ” “Everything is a state secret, no input is asked from the until after decisions are made,” he added. “Employees are kept in the dark. ” The message was not well received by Sean Logan, chairman of the Turnpike Commission. Logan, a former Pennsylvania state senator, decided to fire back at the outgoing employee and also hit the   button, writing: “Mr. Stuban . . . I don’t believe we ever met, and after reading your Exit Questionnaire, I am grateful that we didn’t. ” He added that the commission “couldn’t be to [sic] bad of a place considering you stayed for 35 years. Best of luck in your retirement. ” Stuban told the Daily News that he found out about Logan’s reply from his former colleagues. “He did miss the point,” Stuban said. “If it was an effective company and someone told you there are problems and no morale, you don’t have to believe me, but maybe someone should check into it. ” “They hire a lot of people that are dumb as rocks,” he added.  Logan told PennLive that the message was the first time he’d been made aware of Stuban’s frustration and said he didn’t appreciate the means of delivery. “I thought it was a very disingenuous way to communicate your issues,” Logan said. “If he really wanted to be constructive with his criticisms and suggestions, there’s a whole other way to do it. ” But he did lend some credence to several of Stuban’s criticism, such as the idea that employees are kept in the dark about management decisions. “We’re running a   with a B, organization here,” Logan told PennLive. “We can’t put everything out there. ” But he pushed back against the idea that his executives are “out of touch,” noting that Turnpike Commission chief executive Mark Compton and chief operating officer Craig Shuey “communicate very, very well with our employees and are out there in the field. ” “I would love to have received that criticism in a more constructive way because it does make you think,” Logan told PennLive. “Should I have communicated more frequently? That’s a valid point. ” Stuban rose up through the commission ranks over several decades. He retired as a midlevel manager, but he told the Daily News that he began his career working in a tollbooth. Stuban told the Daily News that he lives along the Ohio River in western Pennsylvania and he plans to travel and volunteer at his church now that he’s retired. “I’m staying active in the community,” he told the paper.

","   Donald Trump has picked as his secretary of state Rex Tillerson, the chief executive of ExxonMobil, Trump’s transition team announced Tuesday, setting up a possible confrontation with members of his own party in the Senate. Since Tillerson’s name emerged as a candidate for the post, leading Republicans have expressed reservations about his years of work in Russia and the Middle East on behalf of the multinational oil company. But some lawmakers seemed to be signaling they will support him after the announcement was made. Also under scrutiny is Tillerson’s ties with Russian President Vladi mir Putin amid wider probes of Russian influence following a CIA assessment pointing to Russian computer hacking during the presidential race.  After Tillerson’s nomination was official, several Republican senators offered various degrees of support, led by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell ( . ). He said in a statement: “I look forward to supporting his nomination. ”    ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson in 2015. (Evan  )  Other GOP senators, including Jeff Flake (Ariz.) who sits on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that will first have to approve Tillerson before a Senate floor vote, said that backing for Tillerson from some prominent figures  —   former secretaries of state James Baker and Condoleezza Rice, and former defense secretary Robert M. Gates  —   “carry considerable weight. ”  Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker ( .) has called Tillerson a “very impressive individual. ” The one obvious red flag for Tillerson is Sen. Marco Rubio ( .) who is also a member of Foreign Relations, where only one Republican vote would endanger the nomination. Rubio expressed “serious concerns” and vowed to ensure a “thorough” vetting of the nominee on the committee. “The next secretary of state must be someone who views the world with moral clarity, is free of potential conflicts of interest, has a clear sense of America’s interests,” Rubio said. Sen. James Lankford ( .) echoed Rubio’s call that Tillerson’s views be “closely examined,” such as his relations with China and Russia and views on Middle East tensions. And Sen. Lindsey O. Graham ( . C.) who wants a bipartisan investigation of Russian influence on the U. S. elections, said he expects “U. S.  relations to be    in his confirmation process. ” While Senate Democrats cannot filibuster Trump’s Cabinet picks, Republicans have only 52 votes in the Senate, leaving them in potential jeopardy if Democrats unite in opposition to Tillerson. It will take at least 50 votes to confirm a nominee, plus Vice   Mike Pence casting a tiebreaking vote.

"," Congressional leaders are vowing to vigorously probe allegations that Russia interfered in the elections to benefit   Donald J. Trump, but they are already arguing over who should do so and how any examination should be conducted. Senior Republicans want to channel any investigation through the House and Senate intelligence committees, over which they have greater control. But some Democrats, fearing that the results of such an investigation would never be released to the public, are pushing the formation of an independent body of outsiders modeled on the Sept. 11 commission. Still other Republicans would like to see a bipartisan investigation in Congress    or better yet, form entirely new congressional committees and subcommittees to dig into the matter. A different group of Democrats would like to see a very unusual bicameral probe into whether Russia allegedly hacked the Democratic National Committee emails and leaked them to WikiLeaks in a concerted effort to damage Hillary Clinton. The cacophony of competing voices on Capitol Hill could hamstring the rare,   commitment to dig into allegations Russian interfered with the 2016 election. It may also allow Trump to discredit lawmakers’ efforts as overly partisan  —   the   has called charges “ridiculous” that Russia interfered in the election to benefit his candidacy. In public statements, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell ( .) and House Speaker Paul Ryan ( .) have both focused on channeling any Russia investigation through their intelligence committees.    House Speaker Paul Ryan ( .) speaks to the media after meeting with   Donald Trump at Trump Tower in New York, U. S. December 9, 2016.   Kauzlarich (Mark  )  McConnell on Monday said the Senate Intelligence Committee  —   of which he is a symbolic member as the chamber’s GOP leader    is “more than capable of conducting a complete review of the matter. ” Ryan agreed, saying that a special panel is unnecessary because the House Intelligence Committee is “working diligently on the cyber threats posed by foreign governments and terrorist organizations. ” But if history is any guide, those investigations could be highly classified and damaged by partisan infighting. Their findings may be subject to presidential review and closely held by top lawmakers, the intelligence community and senior aides in the Trump White House.  “There certainly is a danger in this being swept under the rug,” said Oregon Sen. Ron Wyden (D) an Intelligence member. “There must be urgency and transparency in getting facts out into the open, whether they’re being investigated by the intelligence committees, other standing congressional committees, a joint committee or an independent commission. ”  The closest parallel may well be the   “torture report,” produced in 2014 by the Senate Intelligence Committee documenting CIA treatment of suspected terrorist detainees in the wake of Sept. 11. Despite   Dianne Feinstein’s ( .) intense desire to see the full   report released, all but the   executive summary has remained private.   That panel devolved into near chaos when the torture report was released without the support of Republicans, including the incoming chairman of the Intelligence committee, Sen. Richard Burr ( . C.). When he became chair, Burr demanded the return of all copies of the report, apparently concerned it could be obtained through the Freedom of Information Act. President Obama just this week made moves to preserve the report when he leaves office without ensuring it immediately becomes available to the public.     Vice   Mike Pence gestures to reporters during a meeting with House Speaker Paul Ryan on Capitol Hill on Nov. 30, 2016.   Gripas (Yuri  )  Obama has also taken steps to collect information about the CIA allegations before he leaves office on Jan. 20, ordering a “full review” of the charges be delivered to him before he leaves office. Separately, a group of senior Democratic senators is pushing Obama to declassify information about Russia’s alleged   hacking operations before Trump is inaugurated. Russian President Vladimir Putin’s spokesman on Tuesday issued a blunt denial of U. S. allegations that the Kremlin intervened to help Trump win the presidency, and expressed hope that Moscow will be able to “reset” its relationship with the new administration.  In an interview with RT television, Peskov dismissed the findings by the CIA that the Russian government aided Trump  —   or that it was interfering in upcoming German elections  —   as “absolute nonsense. ” The battle over how to investigate Russian influence is likely to bleed over into the confirmation hearings of Exxon Mobil CEO Rex Tillerson, who was nominated on Tuesday by Trump to be his secretary of state. Several Republican senators, who must vote to confirm Tillerson, expressed concern over ties Tillerson has to Russia’s President Vladi mir Putin, who decorated him with the Kremlin’s Order of Friendship in 2013. “While Rex Tillerson is a respected businessman, I have serious concerns about his nomination,” Sen. Marco Rubio ( .) a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that will hold confirmation hearings, said in a statement. “The next secretary of state must be someone who views the world with moral clarity, is free of potential conflicts of interest, has a clear sense of America’s interests, and will be a forceful advocate for America’s foreign policy goals to the president, within the administration, and on the world stage. ” McConnell, however, backed Tillerson, saying “I look forward to supporting” his nomination. The House and Senate intelligence panels have already had briefings from various officials pertaining to allegations Russia interfered in the elections. But in the House, Chairman Devin Nunes ( .) has also criticized Director of National Intelligence James R. Clapper for presenting the committee with a different take on Russia’s hacking activities than the CIA assessment saying the Kremlin interfered to help Trump win. The committee “has an urgent need to accurately understand the current IC assessment of alleged Russian cyberactivities relating to the election, and any disagreements among IC components,” Nunes wrote in a letter to Capper on Monday. In a separate statement Monday, Nunes also said that he “do[es] not see any benefit in opening further investigations. ” But so far, those committees haven’t made any of their current information public, and may not do so if they broaden their reach.  Top avoid such a situation, Senate Democrats  —   including Feinstein    have called for an independent commission of experts, appointed by congressional leaders, to investigate the charges. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi ( .) also supports that idea in which both sides would have subpoena power. Such a committee would be structured like the Sept. 11 commission, with both parties’ leaders appointing one to two   to sit on it. The president would not be allowed to appoint panel members, a courtesy often extended during the creation of other commissions, as Democrats believe Trump would have a conflict of interest because of the nature of the charges. Democrats want a report made public 18 months after such a panel begins its work. McConnell, Ryan, and other committee leaders  —   including Trump’s most vocal critics on the Hill  —   have been dodging direct questions about whether they believe the CIA’s assessment that President Vladi mir Putin, who Trump frequently praised during the campaign, was behind the hacks the CIA believes were intended to help Trump prevail. Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain ( .) who has said “there’s very little doubt” Russia intervened in the elections and has derided Trump for casting doubt on that conclusion, suggested that in this one instance, maybe the CIA is wrong. “The CIA has not always been exactly right, to say the least,” he said. In the wake of the CIA allegations, however, McCain and Sen. Lindsey Graham ( . C.) joined calls from incoming Senate Democratic leader Charles E. Schumer (N. Y.) to initiate a bipartisan probe. For McCain, the election is one part of a larger examination that must focus on national security risks posed by cyber threats, particularly related to the military. Officials already suspect that Russia may have been behind a major email breach at the Pentagon last year. Sen. Bob Corker ( .) who chairs the Foreign Relations Committee, has also pledged to dig into the allegations of Russian hacking next year. And Sen. Lindsey Graham ( . C.) who chairs two subcommittees on the Judiciary and Appropriations committee, has also committed to investigating Russia’s alleged intervention in the elections, as well as other nefarious activities across the globe, including in the conflicts in Syria and Ukraine.

","           Donald Trump has tapped Republican Rep. Ryan Zinke, who has represented Montana’s   congressional seat for one term, to serve as secretary of the Department of the Interior, according to an individual with firsthand knowledge of the decision. Zinke, who studied geology as an undergraduate at the University of Oregon and served as a Navy SEAL from 1986 to 2008 before entering politics, campaigned for his House seat on a platform of achieving North American energy independence. He sits on the House Natural Resources Committee as well as the Armed Services Committee. A lifelong hunter and fisherman, the    Zinke has defended public access to federal lands even though he frequently votes against environmentalists on issues ranging from coal extraction to oil and gas drilling. This summer, he quit his post as a member of the GOP   committee after the group included language that would have transferred federal land ownership to the states.  “What I saw was a platform that was more divisive than uniting,” Zinke said at the time. “At this point, I think it’s better to show leadership. ” Trump also opposes such land transfers, but the provision made it into the official Republican platform. Zinke recently criticized an Interior Department rule aimed at curbing inadvertent releases of methane from oil and gas operations on federal land as “duplicative and unnecessary. ” “Clean air and clean water are absolute top priorities when we talk about responsible energy development, however the final rule issued by the Obama administration does nothing to further protect our resources,” he said in a statement. “This rule is a stark reminder that we need to invest in infrastructure projects like the Keystone pipeline, so we don’t need to flare excess gas. ”  During his time in Congress, Zinke has established a 3 percent voting score with the League of Conservation Voters. But he has broken ranks with the panel’s GOP majority on occasion, opposing a measure by Rep. Don Young ( ) that would have allowed each state to buy up to 2 million acres in U. S. Forest Service land to boost timber production. He has also pushed for full funding of the Land and Water Conservation Fund, a high priority for outdoors groups. Land Tawney, president and chief executive of the   Backcountry Hunters and Anglers, described Zinke on Tuesday as “a straight shooter” who has established credibility with outdoors enthusiasts in the state. During a recent meeting with him at a distillery in Whitefish, the congressman’s home town, Zinke walked into the place in  . “You wouldn’t know he’s a congressman,” Tawney said. “He really prides himself on being a Theodore Roosevelt Republican, and he lives that a little bit more than other people. ”  Outdoors activities such as mountain biking and skiing are a major economic driver in Whitefish as well as in Montana overall, where roughly 200, 000 residents have   hunting licenses and 300, 000 have fishing licenses. Zinke, who has been endorsed by the Outdoor Industry Association, has embraced that sector of the state’s economy. “Hunting and fishing isn’t something we do in Montana, it’s a way of life,” said Tawney, a   Montanan. Theodore Roosevelt Conservation Partnership President Whit Fosburgh, whose hunters and anglers group has worked with Zinke, said in an interview that it would be “very supportive of Ryan Zinke” as a Cabinet nominee. “He’s shown courage and commitment to public lands and conservation and [is] someone we think would be an excellent secretary of interior,” Fosburgh said.

142227,217637,Trump taps former Texas Gov. Rick Perry to head Energy Department he once vowed to abolish,Washington Post,Juliet Eilperin,2016-12-13,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161214001049/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2016/12/13/trump-taps-former-texas-gov-rick-perry-to-head-energy-department-he-once-vowed-to-abolish/
","           Donald Trump has picked Rick Perry to head the Energy Department, said two people familiar with the decision, seeking to put the former Texas governor in control of an agency whose name he forgot during a presidential debate even as he vowed to abolish it. Perry, who ran for president in the past two election cycles, is likely to shift the department away from renewable energy and toward fossil fuels, whose production he championed while serving as governor for 14 years. The Energy Department was central to the 2011 gaffe that helped end his first presidential bid. Declaring that he wanted to eliminate three federal agencies during a primary debate in Michigan, Perry then froze after mentioning the Commerce and Education departments. “The third one, I can’t. Sorry. Oops. ”  Later during the debate, Perry offered: “By the way, that was the Department of Energy I was reaching for a while ago. ” Speaking to reporters once the event was over, he said, “The bottom line is I may have forgotten energy, but I haven’t forgotten my conservative principles, and that’s what this campaign is really going to be about. ” Despite its name, most of the Energy Department’s budget is devoted to maintaining the nation’s stockpile of nuclear warheads and to cleaning up nuclear waste at sites left by military weapons programs. The department runs the nation’s national laboratories, sets appliance standards and hands out grants and loan guarantees for basic research, solar cells, capturing carbon dioxide from coal combustion and more. Four years after his first Oval Office bid, the former governor sought it once again in the big Republican field that included Trump. Perry touted the high rate of job growth and the low tax rate his state enjoyed under his leadership. At one point, he dismissed Trump’s campaign as a “barking carnival act. ”  The child of a cotton farmer and county commissioner from west Texas, Perry immersed himself in politics from a young age. He was elected as a Democrat to the state legislature but switched to the GOP when he ran for Texas agriculture commissioner. As governor, he recruited    firms to Texas. In 2013, he starred in an ad that aired in California in which he declared that companies should visit his home state “and see why our low taxes, sensible regulations and fair legal system are just the thing to get your business moving. To Texas. ” Salo Zelermyer, who served as a senior counsel at the Energy Department’s general counsel’s office under President George W. Bush and is now a partner at the Bracewell law firm, said Perry has proven “it is indeed possible to successfully balance appropriate environmental regulations with domestic energy production and use. ” “During his time in office, Perry embodied the type of ‘all of the above’ approach to U. S. energy production that many have advocated on both sides of the aisle,” Zelermyer said. “Rick Perry’s Texas was not only a world leader in oil and gas production; it was also a global leader in wind power and renewable energy investment. This approach is a big reason Texas experienced such enormous job growth during Perry’s tenure. ”  But environmentalists take a dim view of Perry. The former governor has repeatedly questioned scientific findings that human activity is helping drive climate change. In 2011 during a presidential debate, he compared the minority of scientists who challenged this assumption to   astronomer Galileo, who was persecuted by the Catholic Church after suggesting that the Earth revolved around the Sun, rather than the reverse. “The science is not settled on this. The idea that we would put Americans’ economy at jeopardy based on scientific theory that’s not settled yet to me is just nonsense,” Perry said at the time. “Just because you have a group of scientists who stood up and said here is the fact. Galileo got outvoted for a spell. ” In his 2010 book, “Fed Up!” Perry described the science showing that climate change was underway and caused by humans as a “contrived phony mess,” writing that those who embraced this idea “know that we have been experiencing a cooling trend, that the complexities of the global atmosphere have often eluded the most sophisticated scientists, and that draconian policies with dire economic effects based on   science may not stand the test of time. ”  “Al Gore is a prophet all right, a false prophet of a secular carbon cult, and now even moderate Democrats aren’t buying it,” he added, referring to the former vice president and environmentalist. Gore met with Trump recently to discuss climate change. Later, during the 2012 presidential campaign, Perry said, “There are a substantial number of scientists who have manipulated data so that they will have dollars rolling into their projects. ” In fact, the top 10 hottest years on record have all been since 1998, and 2016 is expected to be the hottest year since formal   began in 1880. The 2014 summary report for policymakers by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which was endorsed by officials from nearly 200 countries, stated, “Human influence on the climate system is clear, and recent anthropogenic [human caused] emissions of greenhouse gases are the highest in history. ”  “There is no doubt that Rick Perry is completely unfit to run an agency he sought to eliminate  —   and couldn’t even name. Perry is a climate change denier, opposes renewable energy even as it has boomed in Texas, and doesn’t even believe CO2 is a pollutant,” League of Conservation Voters President Gene Karpinski said in a statement. “Not only that, he is deep in the pocket of Big Polluters, who have contributed over $2. 5 million to his presidential campaigns, a disturbing sign that they expected him to protect their profits in office, not do what’s best for the American people. ” Bill Richardson, who was energy secretary under President Clinton, said that Perry was a deal maker, political presence and good manager, and therefore a “sensible choice. ”  But he said that “my big concern is that he’s too tied to the fossil fuel industry and because of Donald Trump’s positions he will try to dismantle the very valuable renewable energy and climate change programs and policies that are a huge part of the DOE. ” Wind power did expand under Perry during his tenure in Texas  —   from 200 megawatts in 2000 to 14, 098 megawatts in 2014, according to the American Wind Energy Association  —   and he supported the construction of transmission lines nearly a decade ago that helped bring   electricity to market. “He created an environment conducive to economic investment through robust infrastructure and competitive power markets that allowed new technologies to enter,” said Tom Kiernan, the chief executive of the American Wind Energy Association, in a statement. “The Texas model under Gov. Perry’s leadership enabled the growth of   wind energy that made the grid more diverse and reliable while saving consumers money. ”  “The fact that Gov. Perry refuses to accept the broad scientific consensus on climate change calls into question his fitness to head up a   agency like DOE,” said Ken Kimmell, president of the Union of Concerned Scientists. But, he added, as governor Perry “increased the ambition of the state’s Renewable Energy Standard, directed state funds to innovative wind energy R&D initiatives, and created a ‘Competitive Renewable Energy Zone’ that helped expand transmission of renewables, bringing clean wind energy from rural communities to new state markets. ” However during a 2015 Iowa Agriculture Summit in Des Moines, the former governor said he opposed extending the federal tax credit for wind power. “I do if a state wants to do it,” he said. “I don’t at the federal level. I think all of these need to be looked at, whether it’s oil and gas, whether it’s the wind side, whether it’s the [Renewable Fuel Standard program]  —   I think all of them need to be put on the table, prove whether or not these are in fact in the best interest of this country. ” Referring to renewable sources, Jennifer Layke, the World Resources Institute energy program director, said: “The Department of Energy leads essential programs that drive innovation and fill important gaps to get new technologies off the ground. These are vital to keep the U. S. at the frontier of energy technology. In recent years, the Department of Energy has given U. S. businesses a significant boost to accelerate the development of battery storage, solar panels and electric vehicles. These programs must continue. ” Perry sits on the board of Energy Transfer Partners, the firm that is trying to complete work on the Dakota Access Pipeline on the Great Plains. Under President Obama, the Army Corps of Engineers recently decided to withhold a key permit from the company that is needed to finish the oil pipeline. The pipeline has drawn protests from activists who say that segment of the pipeline would disturb American Indian burial grounds and pollute the drinking water of the nearby Indian reservation. The Energy Department has not played a role in that   process, however, and Trump has indicated he would allow the project to move forward once he takes office.  The Energy Department Perry would take over has changed substantially since its creation in 1977 under President Carter on the heels of the oil crisis that struck after the Arab countries of OPEC imposed an embargo on the United States. In the 1970s, the agency focused on weapons maintenance and regulations. In the 1980s, nuclear weapons research took center stage. In the 1990s, arms control and   took priority. But the last two secretaries, physicists Steven Chu and Ernest Moniz, have moved laboratories and other  energy programs toward finding ways to slow climate change. The much derided loan and loan guarantee program  —   which stumbled with a half billion loss linked to solar panel maker Solyndra  —   has as of September had issued $31. 98 billion in loans and loan guarantees for 30 projects, which have leveraged $50 billion in total project investment and created or saved 56, 000 jobs. More than $1. 65 billion in interest payments have already been paid. Moniz also used his knowledge of physics and nuclear weapons, and the department’s national laboratories to play a key role in talks aimed at limiting Iran’s nuclear program. Perry brings lacks that knowledge. If confirmed, Perry would walk into an agency where many career civil servants are likely to be wary of him, not only because of his past pledge to abolish the department. Employees there are already on edge, given the fact that Trump’s transition team gave a questionnaire to DOE officials asking that they identify which employees have worked on either international climate negotiations or domestic initiatives to cut carbon. Current DOE leaders have declined to provide any individual names of employees to Trump transition team members. Speaking to reporters Tuesday, White House press secretary Josh Earnest said the administration needed to resist “what certainly could have been an attempt to target civil servants, career federal government employees  …     who are critical to success of the federal government’s ability to make policy, and their work transcends the term of any one president. That’s by design. ” “Our principle —  this is principle that presidents of both parties have long abided by —  is that we should observe the protections that are in place, that ensure that career civil servants are evaluated based on merit, and not on politics,” Earnest added, before tweaking Trump for his latest Cabinet pick. “And I’m sure the   used the same kind of criteria when choosing his new Department of Energy Secretary as well.

142228,217638,Donald Trump might just have made Joe Scarborough as important as he always thought he was,Washington Post,Ben Terris,2016-12-13,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161214001049/https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/donald-trump-might-just-have-made-joe-scarborough-as-important-as-he-always-thought-he-was/2016/12/13/81ce67fe-bd7b-11e6-94ac-3d324840106c_story.html
","       NEW YORK  —   Joe Scarborough knew he had Donald Trump’s ear. And so, in the fall of 2015, not long after the businessman launched a   presidential campaign, the MSNBC host sat him down for a lecture. Things were about to “get real,” Scarborough says he told the newbie politician. It didn’t matter that they had golfed together or laughed together during Trump’s many jolly, blustering cameos on Scarborough’s freewheeling talk shows. Now he was a candidate, and “Morning Joe” would have to hit him with tough questions, and scrutiny of a kind he never faced as a branding mogul and   star. “I said, ‘Donald, here’s the deal,’ ” Scarborough recalled last week. “‘We were friends before the campaign, and when the parade stops and everybody turns on you like they do in politics, we’ll be your friends after the campaign. ’”  Friends.  It’s an acknowledgment of a coziness that drove Scarborough’s critics nuts throughout the 2016 campaign. Every news organization lavished attention on the unpredictable dark horse, of course, but to many, it seemed it was the special attention from “Morning Joe”  —   a relaxed if   clubhouse for the   elite  —   that lent legitimacy to the Trump phenomenon.  But now, his pipeline to The Donald poses an opportunity  —   or, perhaps, a kind of responsibility.  The   may profess to be too busy for classified briefings, but if the   media criticism issuing forth from @realDonaldTrump is any indication, he has an unending hunger for   punditry. “Who do you talk to for military advice?” NBC’s Chuck Todd asked him last year. “Well,” Trump said, “I watch the shows. ” One in particular seems a clear favorite. Scarborough insists this is nothing new for him, that the nation’s “influencers” have always watched his show. It’s a studied bit of nonchalance from a host who has never been known for his humility. But for once, it suddenly seems possible that Scarborough’s levels of ego and clout may be in alignment.  “Trump has been watching Joe for 15 years,” Willie Geist, one of Scarborough’s   said in a phone interview. “He got his sense of politics and the world from ‘Morning Joe.’ ”     Scarborough insists that if you want to know what he tells Trump in private, listen to what he says in public when Trump’s not there. On “Morning Joe,” the former GOP congressman is apt to offer guidance on Cabinet appointments: “Pick Rudy Giuliani as your secretary of state,” he intoned to the camera a week after the election, “and watch everything melt down internationally. ”  He dishes about his chats with the   explaining on Nov. 28 why Trump might bury the hatchet with Mitt Romney. “When the name first came up, I said, ‘You comfortable with the guy? He was tough on you.’ Donald Trump said, ‘Hey, I beat him up for five years. . . I like the fact that the guy pushes back.’ ”  He’ll offer insights into the thinking inside Trump Tower  —   he revealed on Dec. 1, for example, that Exxon CEO Rex Tillerson was a   to lead the State Department before the name was widely floated. When Trump settled on Tillerson on Tuesday, Scarborough declared the pick “checks off the boxes that Ike [Eisenhower] was always looking for in his Cabinet. ” It’s an odd position, advising and reporting upon a president, sometimes on the very same topic. It’s engendered some bad feelings within NBC News, and it put targets on the backs of Scarborough and his longtime   Mika Brzezinski. Trump has referred to the duo as “supporters” and thanked them for helping make him “almost as a legendary figure. ” CNN rival Chris Cuomo called them “boosters”; liberal MSNBC alumnus Keith Olbermann compared the host to Franz von Papen, the German chancellor who eased Hitler’s rise to power.    Trump jokes around with Scarborough after a broadcast from Des Moines in January 2016. “A vibrant and entertaining show,” he once called it, but later he briefly soured: “They lost their way!” (Scott  )  Scarborough views the criticism as “hypocritical,” he said. “Andrea Mitchell is friends with everyone in D. C. Chris Matthews is friends with people who have run for president of the United States. ” No one seemed to mind, he said, that he had    conversations with President Obama or considers Obama’s campaign strategist David Axelrod a friend. So “why in the world,” he complained during an interview at their 30 Rockefeller Center studio, “would this suddenly concern people?” “It’s because they are unfair and mean and jealous,” Brzezinski said as she slid into a seat next to him.   She maintains that just because they build sources and conduct interviews with newsmakers doesn’t mean they should be held to the rigid standards of journalism. “If you’re going to call us journalists,” said Brzezinski, who came up through the ranks as a CBS reporter before joining the pundit class, “you can take every tenet of journalism and show that we’re breaking it. ” Brzezinski has taken to compiling a catalogue of all the occasions they have been tough on Trump. There was the time Scarborough hung up on Trump after he refused to answer questions   about his proposed ban on Muslims entering the United States; the time he proclaimed that Trump’s idea to deport millions of illegal immigrants was “never going to happen”; the time he called on Trump to drop his “birther” conspiracies and admit that Obama was born in the United States; the time he declared that Trump’s supposed ignorance of former KKK leader David Duke’s support was “disqualifying”; not to mention the “dump Trump” column he wrote in August for The Washington Post editorial page, where he is an occasional contributor.  “Go ahead and try to find another host who has been as hard on Trump,” Brzezinski said. Of course, it depends which morning you tune in  —   the blessing and the curse of a       show. Scarborough may have said Trump’s rhetoric was starting to sound like “Nazi Germany” in one interview. But when a recent guest expressed his family’s fear of a President Trump, Scarborough accused him of overreacting: “Hitler is not coming back. ” Yes, Scarborough can point to moments during the campaign where he seemed to predict a Trump victory, but he also tweeted days before the election that he saw no path for it to happen.      Their early relationship was so much simpler. “Rosie is nothing but a bully and a slob,” Trump said during a typical call into “Scarborough Country,” the host’s first MSNBC gig, back in 2007. The topic was his operatic feud with fellow TV personality Rosie O’Donnell.  After Scarborough was promoted to his morning slot in 2007, Trump followed, as both a guest and fan. “It’s a vibrant and entertaining show,” he wrote in his book “Time to Get Tough: Making America #1. ” “They have a great future in television or anything they want to do. ” His only complaint? Scarborough and Brzezinski would occasionally dial up Trump on speakerphone during their own speaking engagements to rile up the crowd, but were never “forthcoming” about their relationship with him: “They should be more open about how I help them. ”  Around that time, Brzezinski said, Trump “started inviting us to things. ” In 2010 they guested on “The Apprentice. ” He came to their book parties and donated to their fundraisers.    Brzezinski and Scarborough interview guests Dec. 12. The show’s chummy vibe has made it popular with newsmakers and audiences while drawing criticism from other quarters. (Jesse   The Washington Post)  “Sometimes when I’m in his office he’ll be like, ‘Here have this, have that,’ ” she said. “He just loves to give. ” It’s an odd assertion from a media professional, after widely reported disclosures that Trump has made relatively few documented charitable contributions and given none of his own money to his charitable foundation since 2008.  But this wasn’t “about buying access,” she said. It didn’t matter, the hosts said, if they were friends with a newsmaker or whether he watched the show. It wouldn’t keep them from honest reporting. Olbermann, long a vocal critic of Scarborough, doesn’t buy this argument. “Like everything else in life,” he said, “there’s already been a ‘Monty Python’ episode that predicted this. ”  He’s referring to a 1970 episode of the surrealist British comedy. At the beginning of the show, the actors are told that the queen may be watching. Then, midway through a sketch, a   announces that Her Majesty has, indeed, tuned in. The cast and the audience immediately stand to attention, and the performance shifts to a stiff, formal tone befitting the tastes of a monarch.      For his first several months as a candidate, Trump would come on the show and yuk it up, Scarborough might call him a “masterful” politician, and everyone seemed happy. “He’s a great guy, and he has a great show,” Trump told Boston radio talk show host Howie Carr, in January. But things soured in May of this year, when Scarborough said he believed Trump’s candidacy opened the door for a   candidate. Trump turned to Twitter in a rage: “Joe Scarborough initially endorsed Jeb Bush and Jeb crashed, then John Kasich and that didn’t work. Not much power or insight!” he typed. Later, after Brzezinski admonished House Speaker Paul Ryan for supporting Trump, the irascible candidate told the world he had stopped watching.       Donald Trump was once seen as being a little too cozy with ”Morning Joe” hosts Joe Scarborough and Mike Brzezinski. The Fix’s Callum Borchers explains how the relationship went downhill. (Peter   Washington Post)   “I hear Mika has gone wild with hate,” he tweeted. “Joe is Joe. They lost their way!” Trump even threatened to “tell the real story” about the   relationship between Scarborough and Brzezinski, both recently divorced and frequently seen together  . (On that matter, Scarborough will only say, “We are an   TV couple, that’s as far as we want to go on that. ”)  But that was many tweets ago. Trump and Scarborough are talking again. And the host is putting his advice out there.  How does Trump take it? “A lot of times the response is a poke that’s suggesting I’m wrong, or prodding me to explain why,” Scarborough said. But the   keeps calling. If Trump didn’t care about his opinion at all, Scarborough suggested, then “Rudy Giuliani would already be nominated for secretary of state. ”        “Trump has been watching Joe for 15 years,” said Scarborough   Willie Geist. “He got his sense of politics and the world from ‘Morning Joe. ’” (Jesse   The Washington Post)   Some days Trump watches “Morning Joe,” and some days it’s clear from Twitter he’s watching something else. Other times he claims he no longer watches it while tweeting very specific observations that make it clear he hadn’t missed a minute. But last week, his vice   Mike Pence, was on, and everyone knew Trump would tune in.  Looking back at the episode now, Scarborough sees it as a great success. Before Pence arrived, he said, the panel spent the morning “excoriating” the son of retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, Trump’s pick for national security adviser, who had helped spread a “fake news” story spouting invented claims that a popular D. C. pizza parlor harbored a Democratic pedophilia ring. Scarborough called it “abhorrent” that the younger Flynn was part of the transition team. When Pence showed up for a later segment, he flatly stated that Flynn’s son had no transition role. To some viewers, it looked like a bit of political prevarication. But in Scarborough’s view, it was news being made. It was later in the day that the Trump team formally announced that young Flynn was out of a job  —   but Scarborough believes the end came on “Morning Joe. ” “We crushed Flynn,” Scarborough said later. “And they decided to cut him loose while watching our show. . . They saw smoke rising over ‘Morning Joe’ and decided they had to do something. ” For a time, all this talk about being an “unofficial adviser” led to rumors that Scarborough could be Trump’s running mate. He denies this vehemently now, but at the time, Scarborough played coy. “I’ll do anything,” he told radio host Hugh Hewitt, to “stop us from eight more years like the past eight years we’ve had. ”  “He may discredit those rumors, but he seems pleased with them,” said Michael Weisman, a former “Morning Joe” executive producer. “Like everybody who is joining Trump now, like everyone who was once against him, if asked, Joe would serve. ” While much of the media has been thrown into an existential crisis by the election, Scarborough isn’t much for introspection. He says he has no regrets: not about how he covered Trump, nor about not joining the campaign. After all, he may already have something more than your average veep.  “I’m good here,” he said. “We have influence. ”  "

","     Alarmed that decades of crucial climate measurements could vanish under a hostile Trump administration, scientists have begun a feverish attempt to copy reams of government data onto independent servers in hopes of safeguarding it from any political interference. The efforts include a “guerrilla archiving” event in Toronto, where experts will copy irreplaceable public data, meetings at the University of Pennsylvania focused on how to download as much federal data as possible in the coming weeks, and a collaboration of scientists and database experts who are compiling an online site to harbor scientific information. “Something that seemed a little paranoid to me before all of a sudden seems potentially realistic, or at least something you’d want to hedge against,” said Nick Santos, an environmental researcher at the University of California at Davis, who over the weekend began copying government climate data onto a nongovernment server, where it will remain available to the public. “Doing this can only be a good thing. Hopefully they leave everything in place. But if not, we’re planning for that. ”  In recent weeks,   Donald Trump has nominated a growing list of Cabinet members who have questioned the overwhelming scientific consensus around global warming. His transition team at the Department of Energy has asked agency officials for names of employees and contractors who have participated in international climate talks and worked on the scientific basis for Obama   regulations of carbon emissions. One Trump adviser suggested that NASA no longer should conduct climate research and instead should focus on space exploration.      The Trump transition team has issued a list of 74 questions for the Energy Department, asking officials there to identify which department employees and contractors have worked on forging an international climate pact as well as domestic efforts to cut the nation’s carbon output. (Whitney   Washington Post)   Those moves have stoked fears among the scientific community that Trump, who has called the notion of   climate change “a hoax” and vowed to reverse environmental policies put in place by President Obama, could try to alter or dismantle parts of the federal government’s repository of data on everything from rising sea levels to the number of wildfires in the country. Michael Halpern, deputy director of the Center for Science and Democracy at the advocacy group Union of Concerned Scientists, argued that Trump has appointed a “band of climate conspiracy theorists” to run transition efforts at various agencies, along with nominees to lead them who share similar views.  “They have been salivating at the possibility of dismantling federal climate research programs for years. It’s not unreasonable to think they would want to take down the very data that they dispute,” Halpern said in an email. “There is a fine line between being paranoid and being prepared, and scientists are doing their best to be prepared. . . . Scientists are right to preserve data and archive websites before those who want to dismantle federal climate change research programs storm the castle. ” To be clear, neither Trump nor his transition team have said the new administration plans to manipulate or curtail publicly available data. The transition team did not respond to a request for comment. But some scientists aren’t taking any chances. “What are the most important . gov climate assets?” Eric Holthaus, a meteorologist and   “climate hawk,” tweeted from his Arizona home Saturday evening. “Scientists: Do you have a US . gov climate database that you don’t want to see disappear?”  Within hours, responses flooded in from around the country. Scientists added links to dozens of government databases to a Google spreadsheet. Investors offered to help fund efforts to copy and safeguard key climate data. Lawyers offered pro bono legal help. Database experts offered server space and help organizing mountains of data. In California, Santos began building an online repository to “make sure these data sets remain freely and broadly accessible. ” Climate data from NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration have been politically vulnerable. When Tom Karl, director of the National Centers for Environmental Information, and his colleagues published a study in 2015 seeking to challenge the idea that there had been a global warming “slowdown” or “pause” during the 2000s, they relied, in significant part, on updates to NOAA’s ocean temperature data set, saying the data “do not support the notion of a global warming ‘hiatus. ’” In response, the U. S. House Science, Space and Technology Committee chair, Rep. Lamar S. Smith ( .) tried to subpoena the scientists and their records. That effort launched by Holthaus is one of several underway to preserve key federal scientific data.  In Philadelphia, researchers at the University of Pennsylvania, along with members of groups such as Open Data Philly and the software company Azavea, have been meeting to figure out ways to harvest and store important data sets. At the University of Toronto this weekend, researchers are holding what they call a “guerrilla archiving” event to catalogue key federal environmental data ahead of Trump’s inauguration. The event “is focused on preserving information and data from the Environmental Protection Agency, which has programs and data at high risk of being removed from online public access or even deleted,” the organizers said. “This includes climate change, water, air, toxics programs. ” The event is part of a broader effort to help San   Internet Archive with its End of Term 2016 project, an effort by university, government and nonprofit officials to find and archive valuable pages on federal websites. The project has existed through several presidential transitions.  At the American Geophysical Union’s fall meeting in San Francisco, where more than 20, 000 earth and climate scientists have swarmed the city’s biggest conference center this week, an air of gallows humor marked many conversations. Some young scientists said their biggest personal concern is funding for their research, much of which relies on support from NASA and other agencies. “You just don’t know what’s coming,” said Adam Campbell, who studies the imperiled Ross Ice Shelf of Antarctica. But others also arrived at the meeting with a strengthened sense of resolve. Campbell was planning to join hundreds of other people at a rally Tuesday, organized in part by the activist group ClimateTruth. org, encouraging researchers to “stand up for science. ” “People have felt a call to arms,” Campbell said. “We need to be outspoken. ”      Donald Trump will enter the White House with an environmental policy agenda opposed to that of the Obama administration and many other nations that have pledged support to the Paris climate agreement. The Washington Post’s Chris Mooney breaks down what a Donald Trump presidency will mean when it comes to climate change. (Daron   Washington Post)   Lawyers with the Climate Science Legal Defense Fund  —   which provides legal assistance to researchers facing lawsuits over their work on climate change  —   will be holding    consultations with researchers who think they might need help from a lawyer. And the organization’s table in the AGU exhibition hall is piled high with booklets titled “Handling Political Harassment and Legal Intimidation: A Pocket Guide for Scientists. ”  “We literally thought about it the day after the election,” said Lauren Kurtz, the legal defense fund’s executive director. “I have gotten a lot of calls from scientists who are really concerned. . . . So it’s intended in some ways to be reassuring, to say, ‘There is a game plan; we’re here to help you. ’” The   guide contains advice for government researchers who believe their work is being suppressed, as well as how scientists should react if they receive hate mail or death threats. Holthaus, who encouraged scientists to flag key databases, said the effort to safeguard them is mostly precautionary. “I don’t actually think that it will happen,” he said of efforts by an incoming administration to obscure or alter scientific data. “But I think it could happen. . . . All of these data sets are priceless, in the sense that if there is a gap, it greatly diminishes their usefulness. ”  That’s the main concern for Andrew Dessler, a professor of atmospheric sciences at Texas A&M University. He said he doubts that even the most hostile administration would try to do away with existing climate data, given the potential backlash. “I think it’s much more likely they’d try to end the collection of data, which would minimize its value. Having continuous data is crucial for understanding   trends,” Dessler said. “Trends are what climate change is about  —   understanding these   changes. Think about how much better off the people who don’t want to do anything about climate change would be if all the   temperature trends didn’t exist. ” He added, “If you can just get rid of the data, you’re in a stronger position to argue we should do nothing about climate change. ” Chris Mooney in Washington and Sarah Kaplan in San Francisco contributed to this report.

","     Two weeks ago,   Donald Trump promised to hold a news conference Thursday that would detail how he intends to deal with his business operations while president. There remain huge questions about him handing over control to his children and increasing concerns about conflicts of interest. But now the news conference is off  —   delayed until next month, his team said. This happens a lot. Trump, as Philip Bump noted back in August, often promises something will happen in a few weeks. Then it doesn’t. And then sometimes it never happens. Below, we detail five things Trump has promised that we’re still waiting on. A news conference Trump hasn’t held a news conference since July, despite criticizing Hillary Clinton during the 2016 campaign for avoiding her own news conferences. This fact has been noted repeatedly since his election because, as Brian Stelter reports,   usually hold one within days of winning  —   an average of 3. 4 days later. So, in the face of all of these questions about his business empire and other things, Trump and his top aide have been promising one for a while. Nov. 21, Kellyanne Conway: “Soon, but he’s just got   days filled with meetings. ” Nov. 30:   I will be holding a major news conference in New York City with my children on December 15 to discuss the fact that I will be leaving my . ..  —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 30, 2016   Monday:   I will hold a press conference in the near future to discuss the business, Cabinet picks and all other topics of interest. Busy times!  —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 13, 2016   Apparently Trump’s next news conference will be in the new year. Tax returns From a May 2014 interview with an Irish TV station: “If I decide to run for office, I’ll produce my tax returns, absolutely, and I would love to do that. ” From a February 2015 interview with radio host Hugh Hewitt, on whether he would release them if he ran: “I would release tax returns, and I’d also explain to people that as a person that’s looking to make money  —   you know, I’m in the business of making money until I do this  —   and if I won, I would make money for our country. ” From January on NBC’s “Meet the Press”: CHUCK TODD: Will you release any of your tax returns for the public to scrutinize? TRUMP: Well, we’re working on that now. I have very big returns, as you know, and I have everything all approved and very beautiful, and we’ll be working that over in the next period of time, Chuck. Absolutely.   …     TODD: But you will release it  —   TRUMP: I pay, it’s a little tax. And I say it. And the reporters said, “That’s the most refreshing answer I’ve ever heard on taxes,” because everyone tries to build it up, like Mitt Romney. He built it up, tried to build it up, how much he paid. It just doesn’t work that way. But I’ll be  —   we’re working on it right now, and at the appropriate time, you’ll be very satisfied. From February on “The Today Show”: MATT LAUER: Real quickly: When are you going to release your tax returns? TRUMP: Probably over the next few months. They’re being worked on now. Trump would later cite the fact that he is under audit for not releasing his returns (although: legally, that wouldn’t prevent their release) and his tax attorneys say he’s been “under continuous examination” by the Internal Revenue Service since 2002. So that’s not new  —   and it was the case when he made the pledge in the first place. He still hasn’t released them, and given that standard, it’s not clear when he might. Melania Trump’s immigration details From August, when questions about whether her early work as a model in the United States was done legally: “She came in totally legally, all right? . .. I said to her, ’No, no. Let it simmer for a little while. Let them go wild. Let it simmer, and then let’s have a little news conference.’ . .. Let me tell you one thing. She has got it so documented, so she’s going to have a little news conference over the next couple of weeks. That’s good. I love it. I love it. ”   Trump spox Hope Hicks confirms @MELANIATRUMP will hold news conference on immigration questions. No timing details https:  .   —   Jeremy Diamond (@JDiamond1) August 9, 2016   There has been no news conference or a release of evidence backing up his claim. Melania Trump would later tweet a letter from her immigration attorney laying out her timeline, but without substantiating the claims with documentation. And in November, just before Election Day, the Associated Press reported she was paid for 10 modeling jobs in the United States in 1996 during a time when her timeline indicated she was still on a visitor’s permit  —   before she was authorized to work. Lawsuits against his accusers (and others) In October, he said he would sue the women who accused him of unwanted sexual advances and assault: “Every woman lied when they came forward to hurt my campaign. Total fabrication. The events never happened. Never. All of these liars will be sued after the election is over. ” Earlier that month, his team threatened to sue the New York Times over its reporting on those allegations, and he also threatened to sue the newspaper over its report that he could have avoided paying taxes for many years:   A lawsuit is being drafted now by Trump against the NYT. Very possible it could be announced tonight, though discussions ongoing.  —   Robert Costa (@costareports) October 13, 2016   About two months later, Trump has not sued his accusers or the Times.      Donald Trump’s stance on presidential candidates has changed significantly over the years. Here’s how. (Peter   Washington Post)   A plan to defeat the Islamic State, or ISIS May 2015: “All I can tell you it is a foolproof way of winning, and I’m not talking about what some people would say, but it is a foolproof way of winning the war with ISIS. ” June 2015: “The problem with politics is if I tell you right now, everyone else is going to say, ’Wow, what a great idea.’ You’re going to have 10 candidates go and use it, and they’re going to forget where it came from, which is me. But no, I have an absolute way of defeating ISIS. ” By August, Trump delivered a speech on radial Islamist terrorism that his website bills as “Donald Trump’s Detailed Plan to Defeat ISIS. ” But the speech didn’t include all that much detail concerning the Islamic State, specifically. And a month later, Trump pulled a 180, saying he would go to the military generals and have them assemble a plan in his first 30 days in office.      At a rally in Greenville, N. C. Sept. 6, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump said that as president he would give his top generals 30 days to present him with a plan to defeat the Islamic State terrorist group. (The Washington Post)   By late September, Conway said there was still a plan: “He certainly has a plan. I’ve heard it. ” We still don’t know what that plan is. Trump has said he doesn’t want to telegraph too much. But it’s not clear whether his “foolproof” plan is the operable one, or whether he’ll defer to the generals."

142232,217642,Six presidents have failed to cut red tape. Here’s how Trump could succeed.,Washington Post,Philip K. Howard,2016-12-13,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161214001049/https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/six-presidents-have-failed-to-cut-red-tape-heres-how-trump-could-succeed/2016/12/13/d8b4a9ae-bf1d-11e6-94ac-3d324840106c_story.html
","   Philip K. Howard is chair of the group Common Good and author of “The Rule of Nobody. ”             On Fox News on Sunday,   Donald Trump lamented that those seeking government permits sometimes “are waiting in line for 15 years,” sometimes only to get rejected in the end, and vowed to speed up the process. To succeed, he’ll need a new approach to governing. Every president since Jimmy Carter has vowed to cut unnecessary regulations, but the   machine has defied all attempts at control.  Trump’s idea is to institute a “   ” rule  —   that for every new regulation, two must be removed. Britain instituted a similar protocol in 2010 to cull unnecessary regulation and recently expanded it to “one in, three out. ” This is part of a broader British effort to control regulatory creep, and it has achieved modest success. Imposing similar discipline on new U. S. regulations is long overdue. For the past 50 years, Washington’s approach has been like the Roach Motel  —   regulations check in, but they never check out. But incremental reform is not enough.    reformers have failed because they assume the problem is a matter of degree  —   that there are just too many rules. Liberals stride into the   jungle with pruning shears, and find themselves entangled in the internal logic of the rules. Conservatives get cheers for demanding deregulation, but when push comes to shove, voters don’t want to drink polluted water, eat spoiled food or entrust loved ones to the unsupervised care of strangers in   centers and nursing homes. That’s why the regulatory state grew, not shrank, in the 20 years of Reagan and two Bush presidencies.  What reformers have missed is that regulatory failure is not merely a matter of too much regulation but is caused by a flawed philosophy on how to regulate. Both sides assume that human responsibility should be replaced by what is called “clear law. ” By striving to prescribe every possible good choice, and proscribe every possible evil, U. S. regulation became an obsessive exercise in micromanagement. That’s why rulebooks are often 1, 000 pages, while the Constitution is 15. The evil to be exorcised by all these legal dictates is human authority. Only by lashing each other tightly with detailed law can liberal and conservative politicians be sure that the other side won’t do something bad. But ordinary citizens in our free society are also lashed to these mindless dictates  —   complying with rules that often make no difference, filling out forms no one reads and stymied by bureaucrats whose response to every idiocy is always “The rule made me do it. ” In the name of better freedom, detailed regulations have made everyone powerless. The solution  —   the only solution  —   is to retool regulation to focus on results, not inputs. Find any good school, any good agency, and you will find people who take responsibility for getting the job done. Experts at the Federal Aviation Administration certify planes as “airworthy” based on their expert judgment, not compliance with detailed specs on, say, how many rivets per square foot. Teachers at good schools typically say that the principal encourages them to do what they think is best and not worry about complying with many forms and metrics. The activating mechanism for every public choice must be human responsibility. What’s good is what works. Yes, it’s a good idea to review environmental impacts, but it’s idiotic to spend a decade creating   tomes that double the cost of projects and cause environmental harm by prolonging polluting bottlenecks.  The opportunity here is to move from paralysis to practicality. Focusing on results, with clear lines of authority and accountability, is a   strategy: Regulation is more effective, and less costly, when regulators and citizens are not preoccupied with compliance. Australia replaced dense nursing home regulation with 31 general principles  —   for example, to provide “a   setting. ” Within a short period, nursing homes across Australia markedly improved because, studies showed, the caregivers felt free to focus on what residents needed instead of trudging through the day with their noses in a rulebook.  Regulation by results would radically simplify law  —   in some areas, more like “   . ” Hundreds of federal safety specifications for factory equipment could be encompassed within one general principle: “Tools and equipment shall be reasonably suited for the use intended, in accordance with industry standards. ” Is there room for disagreement? Yes, but only at the margins. Instead of wasting regulatory resources on foot faults that don’t matter, the safety agency could redeploy its resources to finding workplaces that are actually unsafe. Specificity would still be needed for, say, pollution discharge limits, but the litmus test should be whatever achieves the desired results. Rebuilding the federal behemoth is an ambitious goal, fraught with perceived peril as well as opportunity. But do we have a choice? No one serious defends the inefficiencies in the current system. Americans are tired of being pushed around by headless bureaucracy.   by the past six presidents have all failed. The upside here is transformational. Virtually every federal program is broken, with the only open question how much. Should   compliance costs drive small banks into the arms of larger banks? Should safety laws prohibit children from normal play activities? All these stupidities can be cured, but only if people with responsibility are given the freedom to use common sense. Giving permits for infrastructure in two years, not 10, would add 1. 5 million jobs and create a greener footprint.  The downside is low. Rigid bureaucracy prevents officials and citizens alike from adapting to rapid changes in global forces. Regulation by results doesn’t guarantee success, but it gives us the freedom to try.

142233,217643,How Trump can beat Putin at his media game,Washington Post,Jeffrey Gedmin,2016-12-13,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161214001049/https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/how-trump-can-beat-putin-at-his-media-game/2016/12/13/3f31db2a-bf14-11e6-94ac-3d324840106c_story.html
","   Jeffrey Gedmin is a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, a senior adviser at Blue Star Strategies consulting firm and former president and chief executive of Radio Free   Liberty. Gary Schmitt is   of the Marilyn Ware Center for Security Studies at the American Enterprise Institute.              Donald Trump clearly views himself as master of the deal. When will the   catch on that Russian President Vladimir Putin has been taking the United States to the cleaners in the media and information game? Putin has engineered a deal so profitable to his interests and so disadvantageous to the United States that it ought to become a   case study. In 2005, Moscow decided to rebrand Putin’s Russia by establishing the   and   television network Russia Today. Its product and intended customer were clear: flattering news and information about Russia for a global audience. Russia Today hired young, attractive   talent from the ranks of unemployed American and British journalists. Such upstart talent thrived at Russia Today, where Bernie     meets a youthful, edgy culture supported by   production values. Like any good business, Russia Today showed agility and adapted to market conditions. When network executives discovered that the name was a liability, they changed Russia Today to RT (just as Kentucky Fried Chicken changed its name to KFC around the time popularity of fried foods began to fade). It also became clear that audience size would be driven not by good news about Russia, but bad news about the United States. An emphasis on the woes and hypocrisies of U. S. politics and society would dovetail nicely with Putin’s vision of making Russia great again and delegitimizing the U. S.  liberal order. Bolstered by substantial resources from the Kremlin’s coffers, RT expanded with   and   services and launched RT UK in 2014. French broadcasts are expected in 2017.  There was one more thing RT needed to do to be successful: tilt the playing field to its advantage. RT’s American competitors,   Voice of America and Radio Liberty, have evolved since the Cold War into multiplatform media companies comprising television, Web, social media and radio. Both provide reliable news and information, and both help ordinary Russians better understand their own country and the United States.  And here’s the rub.  The Kremlin decided it wouldn’t do to just jail U. S.  journalists and expel VOA and Radio Liberty. Putin decided on a shrewder approach. First, he disrupted their indigenous network of partner stations. Russian authorities used health and fire inspectors, tax collectors and   police to harass VOA and Radio Liberty affiliates and drive up the cost of doing business with the Americans. In short order, Radio Liberty’s local partners, for instance, shrank from several dozen to a handful. Second, the Kremlin blocked the Americans from important airwaves, refusing them access to the Russian television market. Russian regulators have steadfastly rejected their efforts to obtain a license. (The BBC has faced comparable harassment and constraint.)  As a result,   rants about America get airtime in America, while U. S.  attempts to fairly and honestly inform Russians are massively curtailed. That’s not an uneven playing field; that’s our adversary owning the field and using America’s own liberality to attack U. S. policies and discredit Western values. The new administration needs to push back. Under U. S. law, there is a standing presumption that foreign ownership of broadcast companies or broadcast licenses may exceed 25 or 20 percent, respectively, only if the Federal Communications Commission determines that allowing it is in the public interest. However, while the law has not changed, the FCC has adopted more lenient rules for assessing that interest and indicated that it no longer frowns upon 100 percent foreign ownership.  Given the proliferation of broadcast mediums today, it was probably appropriate to widen the licensing aperture. And, of course, the United States’ ethic of free speech inclines us to take a relaxed approach to voices other than our own. But that very principle, if we take it as seriously as we should, ought to make us demand reciprocal treatment abroad. When it comes to much of our foreign policy, Trump has argued that U. S. negotiators have failed miserably. We’ve been made chumps by other countries. Free trade is not necessarily fair trade, or so many now believe. And while one can have doubts about that argument’s economic merits, it has certainly been true enough when it comes to   broadcasting. The Kremlin has put hundreds of millions of dollars into its broadcasting and propaganda efforts, and the United States, along with other allies, has provided an open door for it to pursue its illiberal agenda. The least Washington should do is insist that, in exchange for access to U. S. airwaves, the favor be returned. Either the FCC can broaden its “public interest” assessments to include equal access, or Congress can mandate it through amendments to the Communications Act of 1934. Fair play may be more important than ever. Recent reform legislation passed by Congress aims to make U. S. international broadcasting more effective by streamlining bureaucracy. If we resist the temptation to abuse the opportunity  —     dissembling and deceit can never be America’s game  —   and stick to the highest standards of journalistic integrity, we can advance our interests with renewed energy and purpose.  With the end of the Cold War, the hope was that the competition of ideas might end as well. Russian revanchism has put it squarely back on the table, and Washington needs once again to take it seriously.    Read more:   The Post’s View: A big change to U.

142234,217644,Trump and Tillerson: An ethical pigpen,Washington Post,Jennifer Rubin,2016-12-13,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161214001049/https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2016/12/13/trump-and-tillerson-an-ethical-pigpen/
","       “Now we are going to have Donald Trump’s swamp,” said ethics guru Paul Painter of University of Minnesota Law School. “The D. C. swamp is going to be   from New York. ” That’s how Painter described to Right Turn the problems implicit in the  ’s announcement via Twitter that he will leave his sons in charge of his business but make no “new deals. ” On its face, that makes no sense, Painter said. “What is a ‘deal’? It’s just slang for a transaction. You cannot run a business without transactions. ” Leases get renegotiated, loans get refinanced or initiated, hotels renovate and hire  contractors. “This [approach] isn’t going to sell,” said Painter. “We need a deal  —   he has to sell his business. ” Apart from Trump, the administration and everyone who serves in it will have an ongoing problem. Every employee is bound by the ethical standard of impartiality in federal regulations (5 CFR Section 2635. 502). That prohibits employees from taking actions that would “cause a reasonable person with knowledge of the relevant facts to question his impartiality in the matter. ” In such cases, “the employee should not participate in the matter unless he has informed the agency designee of the appearance problem and received authorization from the agency designee. ” However, the regulation is not clear whether, for example, an   employee charged with regulating or negotiating with Congress on a matter that could affect Trump’s   properties would be violating the law if he did Trump a “favor. ” Painter recommends that Congress pass a law such that if, for example, the party to a lease with the government is the president, then no political appointee  —   only career civil servants  —   can rule on the matter. But even then, are the civil servants at risk if they think there is a raise or promotion in store for them if they do something that helps the Trump kids make money? It surely creates the appearance of partiality, at the very least. The issue is especially acute for employees of the federal government who are in the role of adjudicators  —   at the National Labor Relations Board or the Security and Exchange Commission, for example. If a Trump property is at issue (e. g. a labor dispute at a Trump hotel) there is an inherent conflict and any ruling the employee makes could well be overturned upon review in federal court, Painter says. “This is a serious issue. ” If the employee is a member of the state bar, he or she may think twice about ruling on matters for fear of violating his or her professional obligations, which could end in penalties or suspension or revocation of the employee’s law license by the bar. At a bare minimum, inspector generals in the various federal departments and agencies will be charged with investigating fraud, waste and abuse. A   stream of conflicts very well could flow from hundreds of actions the federal government takes every day that could affect Trump’s businesses. Kurt Eichenwald, after a laborious analysis demonstrating how Trump’s foreign business operations could be affected by policy decisions, concludes: Given the extraordinary power Donald Trump now wields, it’s obvious that foreign governments and corporations can easily curry favor, bribe or even blackmail him, which is why the Founding Fathers so feared outside influences on the Executive Branch. Once he’s president, Trump does not need to ask for cash to be delivered to his pockets or to those of his children to cross the line into illicit activities —  and possibly impeachable offenses. Macri of Argentina cannot know if his country will be punished by the Trump White House if the remaining permits for that Buenos Aires project are denied. Abe of Japan does not know if a government holdup of Ivanka Trump’s deal with Sanei International will lead her impulsive father to call for an American military withdrawal from his country. Erdogan of Turkey has told associates he believes he must keep pressure on Trump’s business partner there to essentially blackmail the president into extraditing a political enemy. Duterte of the Philippines believes he has received approval from the   to, at best, abide by or, at worst, continue to authorize the frenzied slaughter of drug users and dealers, and knows he can harm the Trump family if the president ever angers him. Members of Congress are not errand boys for the president or  . Rather than waving off all questions about Trump’s conflicts as House Speaker Paul D. Ryan ( .) does, it is time for them to abide by their oath and demand Trump comply with the Constitution and the spirit of    laws. If not, anyone who goes to work for him should “lawyer up” just in case they get tagged with accusations of a conflict or partiality. Voters in 2018 should hold Republicans to their promise to act as a check on Trump, drain the swamp and uphold the Constitution. And on it goes. But there is more: Enter Exxon Chief Executive Rex W. Tillerson as secretary of state. He has been head of an oil company that has negotiated deals in many countries. Can he act on behalf of the United States with those very same countries now? As the Wall Street Journal reported, in some sense Tillerson got where he is thanks to a deal with Vladimir Putin. (“Rex Tillerson was propelled to the top of Exxon Mobil Corp. partly by negotiating a deal with Vladimir Putin to   an oil project in Russia’s Far East, one of a series of agreements between the pair stretching back to 1999. That relationship is both Mr. Tillerson’s biggest claim to the nomination as Donald Trump’s secretary of state, and potentially the biggest concern about him in the U. S. Congress, where members of both parties are pushing for an investigation into Russia’s alleged hacking and its impact on the U. S. election. ”) How do we know Tillerson won’t be returning favors right and left, or seeking to help his former employer? Tillerson is also going to be tasked with negotiating or renegotiating or ending the Paris climate agreement. Can he do that without creating the appearance of a conflict? To address these and other issue, Tillerson will surely have sell all 600, 000 shares he holds in Exon to comply with specific    rules. However, that doesn’t solve the problem of 2 million shares he is scheduled to receive in the future. CNN reports: Tillerson would know the schedule for when he is due to receive those shares, and his actions in office could influence their value. “It’s a crime to participate in any government action that has predictable effect on your investment holdings,” Painter said. To avoid that problem, or the prospect that Tillerson would forfeit the 2 million shares, Exxon could change its rules and give Tillerson the stock when he leaves the company. But that would be a tremendous favor for the future secretary of state, a move that in itself could raise ethical and conflict of interest questions. A spokesman for ExxonMobil wouldn’t comment if the company is considering such a change. Or Trump could grant Tillerson a waiver from having to follow the conflict of interest laws, a step he could legally do once he is in office. But that option too would just further arm critics concerned about potential conflicts. Of course, Tillerson could walk away from the 2 million shares. He could still sell the 600, 000 shares he already controls  —   currently worth about $55. 6 million. But he would be giving up a pot of money worth $184 million in today’s prices. Tillerson could do all that and still not satisfy government ethics lawyers, say Painter and ethics expert Norman Eisen in a press release for Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington: Even if he does divest, there still may be some necessary recusals. The biggest concerns revolve around his close business and personal ties to Russia, which may be the subject of a separate Senate investigation into apparent interference with the election. . . . It may be that the appearance of conflict and the need for repeated recusals is so profound that the Senate concludes he cannot do the job. We hope the confirmation hearings and the Senate’s investigation of Russia’s alleged intrusion upon the election will provide an occasion for a comprehensive review of all these issues, including full disclosure of all business ties between Russia and senior members of the administration —  including the  . Unlike Trump, Tillerson is going to be subject to explicit    rules. Chances are, he is going to leave quite a lot of money on the table, and the Senate should demand he take that and whatever other steps are need to minimize his conflicts of interest."
142235,217645,The case for Ivanka Trump as first lady,Washington Post,Alyssa Rosenberg,2016-12-13,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161214001049/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/act-four/wp/2016/12/13/the-case-for-ivanka-trump-as-first-lady/
","         It’s a measure of just how hilariously awful Donald Trump’s choices to fill his administration have been so far that when the idea began to circulate last week that his daughter Ivanka Trump might end up serving as his de facto first lady, I actually thought, hey, I don’t hate this. It’s not so much that I’m willing to   the ethical problems with the Trump children’s involvement in their father’s government or that I’ve learned to excuse what the New Yorker’s Emily Nussbaum described as Ivanka’s “weaponized graciousness,” the beaming dishonesty she uses to moderate her father’s ugly, erratic behavior. It’s that of all the ways Trump wants to disrupt government, the first lady’s position is one that could actually use a good  . It remains completely bizarre that there is a position in the federal government that a person is required to take simply because their spouse is elected to a complementary job, regardless of that person’s interests, inclination or passion for the career they actually chose. It’s even weirder that this job, which demands long hours and an extraordinary public performance as the nation’s surrogate mother or cool friend, is both mandatory and unpaid. In a way, the continuing existence of the first lady’s job is a   barometer for how roles for women have or haven’t evolved in the United States. The backlash to women who have tried to change the position too much demarcates very clear limits on how little it’s possible to innovate within that confined space. There’s precedent for a person other than the president’s wife to serve as first lady; Emily Donelson took on hostessing duties for the widowed Andrew Jackson, while Harriet Lane served as first lady for James Buchanan, who never married. Though these women stepped up for their uncles to fill a space left by a death or bachelorhood, Melania Trump isn’t dead. But it certainly seems that her stepdaughter, a more comfortable public speaker with a demonstrated interest in decorating and style and a stated  —   if not demonstrated  —   concern for issues such as family leave and child care, might be a more natural fit for the job. Making an official White House hosting position a job that ought to be filled by the person   for the work, rather than the person who happens to be married to the president, would accomplish a couple of important things. First, this shift would acknowledge that the White House’s social functions are a critically important part of the work of a presidential administration, helping to set the tone for the president’s interactions with hugely accomplished people as well as ordinary Americans. At present, the unpaid nature of the first lady’s job, and the fact that marriage  —   not qualifications  —   is what gets someone the job sends a message that the first lady’s functions aren’t really work. Managing the upkeep of an important national landmark, acting as an ambassador for bipartisan causes and welcoming all sorts of Americans aren’t the same as mining coal, but that doesn’t mean they aren’t valuable national functions  —   so valuable that we insist someone be around to do them. Allowing the president to select someone who is interested in design and historic preservation, and who enjoys doing outreach to the American people, and then paying that person would send the message that this is real work. Second, having an official White House host or hostess who is chosen not on the basis of marriage but on the basis of talent, and with the idea that the job has distinct parameters, would also be an opportunity to clarify what the job is not. The very 1993 court decision that the Trump administration has contemplated using to suggest that nepotism laws should not exclude Trump’s    Jared Kushner, from working in the administration lays out the many ambiguities involved in the first lady’s position: How does one draw a line between the president’s policymaking and ceremonial roles? If the first lady is a government official, can she be removed from office for ethics or legal violations without the president divorcing her? Is the first lady’s position a   job or a   job? Nothing in Trump’s record so far suggests that he would manage these questions with deftness or intellectual curiosity. But if he wants to charge ahead and involve Ivanka Trump in his administration, this desire might force more sophisticated legal and ethical minds to tackle a role that generally has been defined by tradition and custom. The first lady’s job is a ridiculous anachronism. Perhaps this ridiculous administration in the making will accidentally do something about it.

","     “All of us have an interest in making sure that our electoral systems are free from interference. It’s part of our democracy. This is a bipartisan issue, and it’s something that is of concern to all Americans. ” That was Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch in her first    comments about Russian interference in the presidential election. The Post broke the news over the weekend of a secret CIA assessment that Russia was trying to help   Donald Trump win the White House. And since that story was published, Trump has cast doubt not only on Russia’s involvement but also on the veracity of CIA intelligence. LISTEN HERE  For more conversations like this, subscribe to “Cape UP” on iTunes or Stitcher. A flash point in the interference assessment story has been the tension between the CIA and the FBI, which Lynch chalked up to “the interplay of two different systems   …     based on different platforms of knowledge. ” But she said both agencies “will be very careful about the kind of assessment they can make, mainly   …     because neither agency wants to overstate [the situation]. ” That being said, Lynch said, “I will stress that the intelligence community has put forth a statement saying that with great confidence we have a view and a belief that the Russian government did try and interfere with the election. ” Like other Obama administration officials I’ve interviewed for the podcast, Lynch did not criticize Trump. So, when I asked her how concerned she was by Trump not availing himself of all the intelligence briefings, the attorney general said, “I leave it to the new administration to determine how they’re going to manage the flow of intelligence and how they’ll handle those issues. ” [“The integrity of the Department of Justice is important. ”] The “Cape Up” interview with Lynch took place at the All Dulles Area Muslim Society (ADAMS) Center in Sterling on Monday after her speech on the spike in hate crimes against Muslim Americans. FBI statistics released last month showed a 67 percent increase from 2014 to 2015 in such crimes. Not since the aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks have there been so many   incidents. Lynch travels to Harvey Milk High School and the Stonewall Monument in New York on Tuesday to shine a spotlight on hate crimes against lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender Americans.    Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch talks with The Post’s Jonathan Capehart during an interview for the “Cape Up” podcast on Monday at the All Dulles Area Muslim Society Center in Sterling. (Carol   Washington Post)  “These incidents  —   and these statistics  —   should be of the deepest concern to every American,” Lynch told the ADAMS audience. “Because hate crimes don’t just target individuals. They tear at the fabric of our communities, and they also stain our dearest ideals and our nation’s very soul. ” Lynch talked extensively about the actions and prosecutions undertaken by the Justice Department to safeguard every American’s constitutional rights, including freedom of religion. Her passion for this work was revealed when she veered from her prepared remarks  —   just as when she talked directly to transgender Americans when announcing actions to protect their rights and dignity by suing North Carolina over its blatantly discriminatory “bathroom” law last May. [Loretta Lynch to transgender America: I’ve got your back] Yet stalking Lynch’s every word was the knowledge that come Jan. 20, 2017, she will leave with President Obama. And with her most likely will go her and the president’s commitment to civil rights. Lynch lauded the professionalism and dedication of the Justice Department’s career staff and prosecutors. When I asked whether she could guarantee that the department’s work as the backstop for the protection of civil rights would continue after her departure, her answer bowed to reality while issuing a clarion call to the public and an implicit warning to her successors.    “I can’t speak to what priorities the next administration may set,” Lynch said. “And all I can say is there’s no guarantees in life, except that we have to work for what we want and we have to be committed and we have to keep our voices raised to make sure that people who are in power know that these are important issues, that these are issues where the law does compel a certain result in my opinion and should be used in a certain way. ” Listen to the podcast to hear Lynch’s defense of our nation’s diversity, how she will keep working until the very last minute and why she believes that “the highest public office is that of citizen. ” “Cape Up” is Jonathan’s weekly podcast talking to key figures behind the news and our culture.

","  BEIRUT  —   A tentative deal to evacuate the last   zones in the embattled Syrian city of Aleppo was reached Tuesday after reports of widespread civilian deaths spurred diplomatic efforts, a Russian envoy and rebel commanders said. Details of the deal remained unclear, however. Among the questions: whether the possible escape routes would be open to civilians, where those evacuated would be taken, and what could face rebel fighters choosing to leave. A Western diplomat familiar with the outlines of the deal said it was brokered by Turkey and Russia and that it appeared to give people still trapped by the fighting an opportunity to leave. But he said there is widespread skepticism among the rebels’ Western allies that the agreement would be carried out. “We’ll believe it when we see it,” he said. “Russia has now several times now put out a proposal then backed away from it, not made good on it. This might be real . . . but right now we see nothing to indicate good faith or actual intent on the part of Russia. ”  Late Tuesday, Russia announced that the government was in full control of all of Aleppo, though that could not be independently confirmed.

142238,217648,Ohio governor vetoes ‘heartbeat bill’ but signs another abortion restriction into law,Washington Post,Sandhya Somashekhar,2016-12-13,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161214001049/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2016/12/13/ohio-governor-vetoes-heartbeat-bill-but-signs-into-law-another-abortion-restriction/
","     Ohio Gov. John Kasich on Tuesday vetoed a controversial bill that would have banned abortions as early as six weeks into pregnancy but signed a measure prohibiting the procedure later in pregnancy. The measure the Republican governor rejected would have barred a woman from obtaining an abortion if a fetal heartbeat could be detected. The legislature passed the measure last week even though it conflicts with Supreme Court decisions upholding the right to abortion at least until the point at which the fetus is viable. The bill he signed, banning the procedure at 20 weeks of pregnancy, may run afoul of these rulings, because viability is generally interpreted to be around 24 weeks. In a statement, Kasich said he vetoed what has been called the “heartbeat bill” because it was “clearly contrary” to Supreme Court rulings. The state would have been forced to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars trying unsuccessfully to defend the law and would have provoked lawsuits that would end up rolling back other restrictions enacted by the state, he said. In a separate statement, he said he agreed with major antiabortion groups that have preferred to challenge precedent with the   ban, which he said “is the best, most legally sound and sustainable approach to protecting the sanctity of human life. ”  Abortion rights groups condemned Kasich’s support for the   ban, which has no exception for rape or incest and has an exception for the life of the mother that rights groups said was too narrow. “He thinks that by vetoing one abortion ban Ohioans will not notice that he has signed another,” Kellie Copeland, NARAL   Ohio’s executive director, said in a statement. “Kasich’s actions today will fall hardest on   women, women of color, and young women. History will not judge Gov. Kasich’s disregard for women’s health kindly. ” Ohio becomes the 16th state to ban abortion at around 20 weeks, based on the contention that fetuses may be able to feel pain at that stage. Most experts believe that point comes later in fetal development.  While abortion rights advocates on Tuesday focused on the bill Kasich signed, the more restrictive measure drew more attention over the past week because it would have banned the procedure before many women realize they are pregnant. Two other states, Arkansas and North Dakota, recently passed abortion bans at a very early point in pregnancy, but the measures were blocked by the courts. Several other states considered such measures but stopped short after some antiabortion groups worried that they would provoke a legal backlash that further cements abortion rights. Still, Ohio lawmakers  —   emboldened by the election of Donald Trump  —   approved the bill as a new offensive to curb abortion rights. Trump has pledged to appoint justices who oppose Roe v. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion nationally. The law may yet be enacted if the legislature overrides Kasich’s veto. In Ohio, that requires a   majority in each chamber."

(Ashleigh   Washington Post)   The polar vortex is a weather term that was popularized in 2014, though it’s a term that meteorologists have always used to describe a common phenomenon: the circulation of air around the Arctic circle. As long as the jet stream is strong, it keeps cold, polar air confined to the north. At times, the jet weakens, and cold air is allowed to spill south into the   where the Lower 48 is located. The whole vortex does not shift south during these cold outbreaks. Instead, little pieces  —   some stronger than others  —   break away from the main circulation. It just so happens that one of these breakaway lobes will traverse south through Canada this week and wind up over New England on Friday.    "

","         A movie has been made for “Star Wars” fans that finally answers many of the questions they’ve long been asking, having to do with the tensile strength of a franchise that has experienced its share of strain over 40 years, and the ability of artists with new, perhaps iconoclastic visions to bring a faraway galaxy from long ago into a bold new future. That movie is “Star Wars: Episode VIII” and will be in theaters roughly a year from now. In the meantime, we have “Rogue One: A Star Wars Story,” Gareth Edwards’s perfectly serviceable, if undistinguished, placeholder. This is a movie that, technically, doesn’t need to exist, apart from abject fan service, the minting of some easy money and mindshare maintenance at a time when attention spans ping from one   spectacle to the next with brazen promiscuity. So many images in “Rogue One” conjure recent films  —   from “Mad Max: Fury Road” to “Arrival”  —   that it’s easy to forget that it was that first “Star Wars” installment, back in 1977, that started it all.     Jyn Erso (Felicity Jones) and Cassian Andor (Diego Luna) in “Rogue One: A Star Wars Story. ” (Jonathan    Disney Studios Motion Pictures)  To its credit, and like last year’s “The Force Awakens,” “Rogue One” pays homage to the imaginative and physical world that George Lucas and his collaborators built four decades ago. Hewed from the same “used future” aesthetic Lucas so cleverly perfected, the movie has a scruffy, tarnished patina, staging that harks back to wartime classics from the World War II and Vietnam eras, and    visual flourishes. It fits neatly with the “Star Wars” mythos, especially during its rousing third act, some clever digital legerdemain and an immensely satisfying final moment.  What “Rogue One” doesn’t have is much joy, although viewers can’t say they weren’t warned. Edwards and Disney executives have made much of the fact that they wanted this   venture to be “dark,” and is it ever: As “Star Wars” movies go, this one may have the highest body count of them all, above and beyond the Imperial stormtroopers who can be relied on to go out with a desperate Wilhelm scream at least once in a production. That reassuring callback, as well as several others, is present and accounted for in “Rogue One,” which centers on the story of Jyn (Felicity Jones) a young woman pressed into service by a militant splinter group of the Rebel Alliance to perform crucial espionage against the tyrannical Galactic Empire, which is in the process of inventing a superweapon called the Death Star.     Ben Mendelsohn plays Orson Krennic, the Empire’s diabolical weapons director, in “Rogue One: A Star Wars Story. ” (Film Frame    Disney Studios Motion Pictures)  Because this is “Star Wars,” you know that Jyn’s efforts ultimately will involve some kind of ragtag team of plucky misfits. In “Rogue One,” that merry band consists of a rebel intelligence officer named Cassian (Diego Luna) a disaffected Empire pilot named Bodhi (Riz Ahmed) and a snippily sarcastic droid named  . Voiced by Alan Tudyk, this angular, spidery limbed creature provides precious comic relief in a film that is otherwise grim and unsmiling, as Jyn and her brothers in arms do battle with the Empire’s diabolical weapons director Orson Krennic (Ben Mendelsohn).  Sturdily executed by Edwards, whose previous credits include “Monsters” and “Godzilla,” “Rogue One” is nonetheless a relatively rote affair, enlivened by some impressive visuals and Michael Giacchino’s stirring musical score, but lacking the warmth and humor of the previous films. By no stretch is this a disaster on a par with Lucas’s misbegotten prequel trilogy. Still, at least until its final section, “Rogue One” lacks the zip, zing and exhilarating sense of return to form that “The Force Awakens” conveyed so lightly.    Donnie Yen plays Chirrut Îmwe, a blind, mystical warrior monk, in “Rogue One: A Star Wars Story. ” (Jonathan    Disney Studios Motion Pictures)  Jones presents a convincing, if monotonously   heroine in “Rogue One,” and her uncanny physical resemblance to Daisy Ridley, who plays Rey in the new installments, invites intriguing speculation as to whether and how they may be related. But few of her fellow actors make as vivid an impression, and the fey,   Luna is particularly   to play a rakish man of ad ven ture. Chinese actor Donnie Yen, as a mystical warrior, is underused in a role that feels perfunctory and shoehorned in.  Too often, “Rogue One” seems to be checking boxes as it goes about its plotty business, which ultimately has to do with the retrieval of documents, the closing of a shield gate and locating the master switch on a communications control tower. It’s simplistic stuff, and bluntly effective at ginning up the idea of action and stakes, which take on increased heft as “Rogue One” finally reaches its busy, startlingly apocalyptic conclusion. (At two hours and 13 minutes, the film is at least 15 minutes too long). Graced with the first appearance of some of the “Star Wars” series’ most iconic characters  —   at least in the chronological sense  —   “Rogue One” represents an unobjectionable exercise in franchise extension. It’s fine. It’ll do. For now.     . Opens Thursday night at area theaters. Contains extended sequences of   action and violence. 133 minutes.       "

","         Pamela Taylor, whose racist comments about Michelle Obama propelled a small West Virginia town into an unflattering national spotlight and prompted the mayor to resign, will return to her job as head of a   nonprofit group later this month. Taylor was removed from her position as executive director of the Clay County Development Corp. after she used a derogatory term in a Facebook post about the coming shift from Obama to Melania Trump. “It will be so refreshing to have a classy, beautiful, dignified First Lady in the White House,” she wrote last month, adding: “I’m tired of seeing a Ape in heels. ” After images of the post went viral last month, a Clay County Development Corp. representative told The Washington Post that the nonprofit organization’s board had removed Taylor from her position. The uproar also prompted Clay Mayor Beverly Whaling, who commented approvingly on Taylor’s post, to resign. Now, according to a letter from the Clay County Development Corp. ’s acting executive director, Taylor is scheduled to return to her old role Dec. 23, the Charleston   reported. A call to the nonprofit group was not returned Tuesday morning.  In response to Taylor’s reinstatement, Robert Roswall, commissioner for the West Virginia Bureau of Senior Services, and Cynthia Beane, acting commissioner for the state’s Bureau of Medical Services, wrote a letter to the nonprofit’s board requesting copies of its   and   policies, as well as an explanation on how its employees have been trained. Roswall and Beane wrote that “in light of recent events surrounding Ms. Taylor that made national media,” the county must “receive specific assurances that no actions of   will be conducted or viewed as acceptable practices within the work environment for the Clay County Development Corporation. ” “Furthermore, please provide specific guarantees that neither Ms. Taylor, nor any other employee, has in any way conducted themselves in a discriminatory manner with any recipient, or potential recipient, receiving state services that your organization administers,” said the letter, dated Dec. 7 and addressed to Eunice Thomas, president of the organization’s board. Clay County Development Corp. uses state and federal funds and works with the county to provide services to elderly and   residents. In 2014, the organization ranked second among the county’s top employers, according to Workforce West Virginia.  As such, the letter states, the organization should already have in place policies on affirmative action and   or harassment practices.

(Chuck   House)  After Taylor’s comments went viral, an online petition calling for her and Whaling to be fired began filling with digital signatures, ultimately logging nearly 200, 000 of them. Tuesday, as news of Taylor’s reinstatement spread, the petition was updated. “While this petition was previously a success,” the update read, “we’ve just learned Pamela will get her job back on Dec. 23. Please share this petition to show you won’t stand for racism from public sector. ” Efforts to reach Taylor on Tuesday were unsuccessful, but she told NBC affiliate WSAZ earlier that she understood why her Facebook post may have been interpreted as racist, but that it was not her intention. She said she was referring to her own opinion about Obama’s attractiveness, not the color of her skin, according to the news station. Taylor reportedly told WSAZ that the heated public response to her Facebook post had become a “hate crime against me,” saying that she and her children had received death threats. She said she was planning to file a lawsuit against people who had slandered or libeled her amid the uproar, according to the news station. In a previous statement to The Post, Whaling, the now former mayor, said her comment “was not intended to be racist at all. ” “I was referring to my day being made for change in the White House! I am truly sorry for any hard feeling this may have caused! Those who know me know that I’m not of any way racist! Again, I would like to apologize for this getting out of hand. ”  There is a long and ugly history of comparing black people to apes. “In the 19th century and well into the 20th, popular media from movies to fiction to political cartoons frequently portrayed blacks as more simian than human,” social psychologists Phillip Atiba Goff and Jennifer L. Eberhardt wrote in the Los Angeles Times. “It was an association that provided cover for slavery itself, as well as   violence. Lynchings in the United States were often justified by relying on this dehumanizing association, and it surfaced in the Rodney King controversy in Los Angeles: LAPD Officer Laurence Powell had referred to a black couple as ‘something right out of ‘Gorillas in the Mist’ moments before he was involved in the King beating,” they wrote. “Like nooses, the ‘ ’ and white sheets, referring to blacks as apelike is among the most violent and hurtful legacies of our nation’s difficult racial past. ” Racist ape memes have surfaced repeatedly around the Obamas. Several years ago, the Awl catalogued them in a piece called “Primate in Chief: A Guide to Racist Obama Monkey Photoshops. ” The town of Clay has approximately 467 residents, according to a 2015 census estimate. The estimated population of Clay County is 8, 910.   of 1 percent of Clay County’s residents are African American, according to census data. More than   of the presidential votes cast in the county went to Donald Trump. The controversy left Clay scrambling to save its reputation. Local officials condemned Taylor’s comments and the mayor’s response, emphasizing that the incident was not reflective of the community. Council member Jason Hubbard publicly apologized to the first lady, asking outsiders to not “judge the entire community for one or two individual acts,” according to the Associated Press.

","     The Saudi woman was going out for breakfast when she decided to make a statement. Violating the country’s moral codes, she reportedly stepped out in public wearing a multicolored dress, a black jacket and ankle boots  —   without a hijab or abaya, a loosefitting garment. Late last month, she tweeted a photo of her outfit, and the post circulated through Saudi Arabia, drawing death threats and demands to imprison or even execute the woman. On Monday, police in the country’s capital of Riyadh said they had arrested the woman, following their duty to monitor “violations of general morals,” a spokesman, Fawaz   said, AFP reported. The woman, who is in her 20s, was imprisoned after posting the tweet of herself standing next to a popular Riyadh cafe, he said. He also accused her of “speaking openly about prohibited relations” with unrelated men, according to AFP. “Riyadh police stress that the action of this woman violates the laws applied in this country,” Maiman said, urging the public to “adhere to the teachings of Islam. ” Saudi women are expected to wear headscarves and loosefitting garments such as an abaya when in public. The spokesman did not name the woman, but a number of websites identified her as Malak   whose tweet drew international support on Twitter and Facebook two weeks ago. Some referred to her as the “Saudi Rosa Parks,” comparing her to the American civil rights activist who was arrested for refusing to give up her bus seat to a white passenger. According to a woman interviewed by the International Business Times, Shehri had tweeted about her plans to go to breakfast without a headscarf or abaya, and her followers asked her to post a picture. The tweet and photo were posted from her account @AngelQShe, which was later deleted.

Saudi women are also required to obtain permission from a husband or male relative to receive a passport, travel outside the country or marry. Despite these   moral codes, a number of key milestones have taken place in the past year for women’s rights in the country. For the first time in the country’s history, women were allowed to vote during last December’s municipal elections. In September, more than 14, 000 Saudi women signed a petition calling for an end to the country’s male guardianship system. Late last month, a billionaire Saudi prince took a striking stance against the country’s rule prohibiting women to drive. Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, a member of the Saudi royal family, posted a    opinion piece on his website and linked to Twitter, declaring his belief that it is “high time” that Saudi women start driving cars. In Iran, a similar case took place last year involving photos posted on social media. Iranian actress Sadaf Taherian said she had to leave Iran after threats were made against her for her decision to post photographs of herself on social media without a headscarf. A popular TV show starring the actress was abruptly pulled from the state television network schedule. Then, the Iranian government officially denounced Taherian as an “offender. ”  When another popular actress defended Taherian on social media, a spokesman for Iran’s ministry of culture and lslamic guidance said the two actresses would be barred from acting. “As far as this ministry is concerned, these two individuals are no longer considered to be artists any more and do not have any right to act,” the spokesman said.

142243,217653,A Chargers’ move to Los Angeles seems closer to reality,Washington Post,Mark Maske,2016-12-13,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161214001049/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/sports/wp/2016/12/13/a-chargers-move-to-los-angeles-seems-closer-to-reality/
","     As NFL team owners prepare to meet Wednesday in the Dallas area with potential relocations by the San Diego Chargers and Oakland Raiders looming, there is a strong belief within the league that the Chargers plan to exercise their option to join the Rams in Los Angeles beginning next season, according to several people familiar with the league’s inner workings. No resolution to the Chargers’ situation or to the Raiders’ prospective move to Las Vegas is expected Wednesday. The Chargers and their chairman, Dean Spanos, have until Jan. 15 to exercise their Los Angeles option, which the franchise was granted by the league when owners approved the relocation of the Rams from St. Louis to the city. “My sense is that both owners are intent on moving at this point,” a   official with one NFL team said of Spanos and the Raiders’ Mark Davis. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the situation.  Davis has said he plans to move his franchise to Las Vegas. But the Raiders cannot formally apply for relocation until after the regular season, and the move would have to be ratified by at least 24 of the 32 NFL team owners. The league and the owners do not necessarily face a time crunch on the Raiders’ situation, given that Davis’s immediate plan would be to keep the team in Oakland while a new stadium in Las Vegas is built. The Chargers’ deliberations are more pressing, given the   deadline. Spanos has said a decision will come after the Chargers’ season is completed. The owners hope to emerge from Wednesday’s meeting with a better grasp of both situations, even if there are no firm public proclamations. “I suppose we will find out something at this meeting,” the   team official said. The owners are expected to discuss the Raiders’ stadium situation and take up a few matters related to the Chargers’ prospective Los Angeles move. “With the Raiders, there are some moving parts there,” another person with knowledge of the league’s inner workings said. “That will take a while to work itself out. I think there’s some pretty strong sentiment that people would like to see them stay in Oakland. But we have to see if that’s possible. It might not be, and then we’d have to take up the Las Vegas deal. . . . With the Chargers, that’s really up to Dean. That’s really his call and their call. ” The owners in January ratified the Rams’ move from St. Louis to Los Angeles and gave the Chargers their option to join. If that option is not exercised by the Chargers and the Jan. 15 deadline is not extended, the option to join the Rams would pass to the Raiders. The Rams are playing this season in the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum while their new stadium in Inglewood, Calif. is under construction. The owners are to consider two measures Wednesday related to a potential Chargers’ move. One is the Chargers’ lease agreement with the Rams in Inglewood. The other is a debt waiver that would allow the Chargers to finance a portion of a Los Angeles relocation fee. In neither case, the person with knowledge of the situation said, ratification by the owners would necessitate a Chargers’ move. But a third person familiar with the deliberations said the owners’ approvals of the   lease deal and the debt waiver would be important precursors to a potential Chargers’ move. “There are a couple things that have to happen first,” that person said. “There are still discussions going on. This is a very difficult decision for him [Spanos]. . . . This meeting is important but it’s not determinative. There have to be some I’s dotted and some T’s crossed. [But] I’m not sure we’ll be in a much different place tomorrow than we are today. ” Spanos’s decision could become even more wrenching if the league intervenes by coming up with creative ways to attempt to keep the Chargers in place and retain the NFL’s presence in the San Diego market. The San Diego   reported that NFL officials are considering possibilities that include a loan on terms favorable to the team, a league investment in a stadium project in San Diego or a pledge to hold two Super Bowls there in a short span of time. Voters in San Diego last month rejected a measure to provide public financing for a new stadium there for the Chargers. The measure required a   approval but was supported by only about 43 percent of the voters. The defeat left Spanos and the Chargers to sort through options that include moving to Los Angeles or remaining in San Diego and making another attempt to get stadium funding approved, perhaps with a legal challenge to reduce the ratification threshold to 50 percent of the voters. Four city council members in San Diego reportedly planned to send Spanos a letter Tuesday offering Spanos a lease for $1 per year for 99 years at the site of Qualcomm Stadium to renew negotiations on a new stadium. Copies of the letter were to be sent to the owners and to NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell, according to the Associated Press. There also has been speculation about the possibility of the team exploring possible stadium options in San Diego County outside the city. Davis repeatedly has said he is committed to taking his team to Las Vegas, where funding for a new stadium for the team has been approved. But there are potential issues with ratification by the owners, given the apparent concerns by some owners about the size of the Las Vegas market and the involvement of casino mogul Sheldon Adelson in the deal.  Oakland is making its pitch to keep the team, crafting terms of a prospective   deal with a group of investors and developers that includes Pro Football Hall of Famer Ronnie Lott. But city leaders have not been dealing directly with Davis and the Raiders. League and team officials reportedly met Monday with representatives of the city and the development group, and the city council was to consider the   terms Tuesday. It’s not clear if the stadium deliberations in Oakland will influence Davis, who has said he is focused solely on the planned move to Vegas. But those deliberations could affect sentiment among the other owners who must ratify the move. Goodell has said the league’s preference is to see the Raiders remain in Oakland if possible."
142244,217658,Federal Reserve raises interest rates for second time in a decade,Washington Post,Jim Tankersley,2016-12-14,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161215003611/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/12/14/federal-reserve-expected-to-announce-higher-interest-rates-today/
","         The Federal Reserve raised its benchmark interest rate on Wednesday for the first time in a year and signaled that rates could continue to rise next year more quickly than officials had expected. The increase was unanimous and modest, raising the Fed’s key interest rate by a quarter point, from a range of 0. 25 to 0. 5 percent to a range of 0. 5 to 0. 75 percent. It reflects Fed officials’ confidence in the strengthening of the U. S. economy and what officials see as budding signs of higher inflation. But unlike corporate executives and stock traders, Fed officials do not appear to be anticipating a massive growth boost next year from economic policies implemented by   Donald Trump, but they appear set to raise rates faster if those policies were to cause an overheating in the economy.   Markets were slightly up immediately after the announcement, but they started to dive about an hour later, after Fed Chair Janet L. Yellen concluded a news conference about the rate hike. The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 0. 6 percent, the Standard & Poor’s   index slid 0. 8 percent, and the Nasdaq tech index was down 0. 5 percent. Yellen told reporters that she and the Federal Open Market Committee were “recognizing the considerable progress the economy has made” toward full employment and an inflation target of 2 percent. She indicated that she did not see much need for a large,   boost from federal fiscal policy, either tax cuts or spending increases. “I would say at this point that fiscal policy is not obviously needed to provide stimulus to help us get back to full employment,” Yellen said. She then added that she was not trying to advise Trump and Congress on fiscal issues.  Economic projections also released by the central bank indicate that the Fed now expects the economy to grow 1. 9 percent in 2016 and 2. 1 percent in 2017. The projections show that the group expects the Fed to increase rates three times in 2017, to a rate of 1. 4 percent by year’s end. Its September projections signaled only two expected hikes next year. Analysts have warned that if Trump and Congress agree to slash tax rates and increase spending in areas such as infrastructure the Fed could be forced to raise rates faster than expected to counter rising prices. Yellen highlighted uncertainty over those policies at her news conference but said some Fed officials had tried to incorporate expected fiscal changes in their forecasts. Since Trump’s election, markets have jumped  —   with the Dow closing in on a   20, 000  —   and   rates and the dollar have increased.  Several analysts said the Fed was right to take that approach to the new administration’s policies. “The Fed will likely be in    mode, given this substantial policy uncertainty,” said Doug Duncan, the chief economist at Fannie Mae, “and we view this prudency a virtue. ” Much of the Fed statement released Wednesday was unchanged from November, when the Fed declined to raise rates, choosing “to wait for some further evidence of continued progress” toward maximum employment in the economy and a target inflation rate of 2 percent. Officials said Wednesday, as they said a month ago, that “  risks to the economic outlook appear roughly balanced”  —   meaning growth is as likely to speed up as it is to slow down. Fed officials now judge the overall inflation rate to be 1. 5 percent, up from 1. 3 percent in September, but still well below target. They judge core inflation, which excludes volatile commodities such as gasoline prices, to be 1. 7 percent.  In the statement, officials said that “inflation has increased since earlier this year,” a change from November, when the statement said that “inflation has increased somewhat since earlier this year. ” Officials also said that measures of inflation compensation “have moved up considerably but remain low. ” Last month, the word “considerably” did not appear in that line. The Fed’s decision drew criticism from some liberal economists who want rates to stay as low as possible to further boost employment while inflation remains below target. “The Fed’s action today was unwelcome but not unexpected. Still huge economic risks and little evidence of an inflation problem” economist and former treasury secretary Larry Summers wrote in a tweet. Yellen, in her news conference, said she does not favor running a “  economy” where inflation might overshoot its target. “I do want to make clear,” she said, “that I have not recommended running a hot economy as some sort of experiment. ”      The Federal Reserve raised interest rates by a quarter point Dec. 14 and signaled a faster pace of increases in 2017 as the Trump administration takes over with promises to boost growth through tax cuts, spending and deregulation. (Reuters)   The central bank last raised rates at its December meeting a year ago, its first step toward moving the Fed from what economists call the   bound  —   meaning interest rates hovering around zero percent. Trump has promised to cut taxes for individuals and corporations and to boost infrastructure spending by as much as $1 trillion through tax credits that his team says will pay for themselves. Although Trump praised the Fed chair during his campaign, saying he has “great respect” for Yellen, he was mostly critical. Accusing Yellen and the Fed of keeping rates low to help President Obama, Trump said in September: “I think she is very political, and to a certain extent, I think she should be ashamed of herself. ” Yellen’s term ends in early 2018. Asked about whether she would leave her post when the   takes office, the Fed chair said: “I do intend to serve out my   term. I haven’t made any decision about the future. ” Analysts did not expect Fed officials to change their forecasts of future increases this month based on an expectation of what Trump and Congress might do. “We very much doubt that FOMC members want to be accused of seeking to influence Congress and the new administration,” analysts at Pantheon Macroeconomics wrote this week, “given how unpopular the Fed is already with Republican politicians. ”"

For Putin, that’s a win.",Washington Post,David Filipov,2016-12-14,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161215003611/https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/the-kremlin-likes-the-hacking-attention-but-not-the-blame/2016/12/14/65279738-c177-11e6-92e8-c07f4f671da4_story.html
","  MOSCOW  —   President Vladi mir Putin is winning. For now.  The Russian leader is winning because the   War order he has railed against has been thrown into chaos, and the Kremlin’s fingerprints are widely seen to be all over it.  A year ago, Russia faced a united Europe, an expanded NATO alliance, a paucity of geopolitical allies and the possibility of four more years of poor relations with the United States under a Hillary Clinton presidency. Today, Putin’s military contingent in Syria just helped the government essentially retake Aleppo. The CIA has concluded that his hackers worked to help elect Donald Trump, who has dismissed commitments to Europe and touted better ties with Russia.        Donald Trump has picked Rex Tillerson as his nominee for secretary of state. Here’s what you need to know about Tillerson. (Thomas   Washington Post)    In Washington, London, Berlin and Paris,   propaganda is back. It’s been thoroughly updated, though, and comes packaged as fake news, cyberattacks and WikiLeaks. Whether or not the Kremlin is guilty of doing all the things Western accusers say it is, Russia is now considered a master purveyor of geopolitical disorder. And that, for Putin, is a win. “Of course the Kremlin likes the fact of such an atmosphere of chaos,” Gleb Pavlovsky, a former Putin adviser, said in a recent interview. “Because we are traders of chaos. We sell it, and the more chaos there is in the world, the better it is for the Kremlin. ”  But Putin’s successes, if that is what they are, are tactical and temporary, said Fiona Hill, a Brookings Institution scholar and   of a biography of the Russian leader. For years, Putin has been the world’s leader in geopolitical disruption, and the United States under President Obama has been a predictable force and therefore an easy target, she said. If Putin really did contribute to Trump’s victory, he may just have handed his crown over to his biggest rival. “The land of unpredictability and surprise is the land that Putin and the Kremlin have inhabited for the last part of the last 10 years,” Hill said. “But now they’re not alone. Trump is going to be the great disrupter. ” In the long run, Russia needs the United States to be, if not a friend and a partner, then a neutralized,   force, she said: “No one knows if Trump is going to make it that. ” Putin has consistently spoken about the need for modern Russia to have friends. Unlike during the Cold War, Russia is not trying to transform the world order with its own ideology. Russia does not need world revolution. It needs to parlay its status as a master of disruption into a magnet for business partners.     In this sense, Trump’s victory is “a tactical victory for Putin,” said Andrei Kolesnikov, a senior associate at the Carnegie Moscow Center, but also “one that comes with exaggerated expectations” because of the inability to predict what a Trump presidency will bring. “In some sense, it’s dangerous,” Kolesnikov said. Case in point: Trump’s choice of ExxonMobil head Rex Tillerson, whose ties to Russia include major oil deals and a 2013 Order of Friendship award, as secretary of state. Some Russian officials have had trouble hiding their satisfaction with a choice that appears to showcase Russia’s newfound influence. “One can assert with more certainty that it is the attitude toward Russia that has become one of decisive factors in the final choice in favor of the businessman from ExxonMobil, who has such obvious ties and interests with respect to our country, [and who is] an opponent of the   sanctions,” said Konstantin Kosachyov, head of the Committee on International Affairs in the upper house of the Russian parliament. Translation: Winning. The trouble with all this Russian gamesmanship, Pavlovsky said, is that it is making enemies among people with long memories. And that is the paradox at the heart of the Putin worldview. Russia’s leaders may enjoy watching the West chase its tail looking for clues of Kremlin meddling, but Moscow does not want to shoulder the blame.  “The fact that there are people who are convinced that Russia acted on behalf of Donald Trump is frightening,” one senior Russian official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he is not authorized to speak to the press, said Tuesday. “In the long run it could be very dangerous for people to think that Russia may interfere with other people’s elections. ” This explains the considerable efforts on the part of Putin and his aides to temper their enthusiasm for the new administration, at least in public. Consider Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov’s reaction to Trump’s choice of Tillerson. “It’s absolutely illogical to make any forecasts, not to mention to cherish some dreams, that everything will all of a sudden change instantly and everything that couldn’t gain traction and was barely moving will suddenly follow some amazingly successful scenario,” Peskov said. “We are sober enough and realize that this won’t happen. ” Similarly, Putin and his aides repeatedly and vehemently deny allegations of interference in the Brexit vote, as well as the U. S. intelligence accusation that the Russian government helped provide WikiLeaks with hacked emails from the Democratic National Committee and Clinton’s campaign staff. They also deny any intention to interfere in upcoming German elections.  Putin dismissed the U. S. allegations as “hysteria” intended “only to distract the attention of the American people from the substance of what hackers had put out. ” On Wednesday, Peskov called the charges “myths, bedtime stories and boogeymen” and suggested that unsuccessful politicians in the West are trying to blame Moscow for their failures.   The allegations have not hurt Putin’s approval rating at home, which jumped from 81 percent in June to 86 percent in November, according to the   Levada Analytical Center. Every time accusations of campaign interference fly, the Kremlin charges hypocrisy (American advisers helped Boris Yeltsin win reelection in 1996). And it has brought up another good old tool, denying it all  —   sanctions, hacking suspicions, the international sports doping scandal  —   as Russophobia.    “You all know that we have encountered attempts to pressure us from abroad over these last years,” Putin said in his annual address to parliament this month. “They have used every means, from spreading myths about Russian aggression, propaganda and meddling in others’ elections to persecuting our athletes, including our Paralympic athletes. ” The approach seems to be working. A poll published in November by the Chicago Council on Global Affairs and the Levada Center found that only 23 percent of Russians say they have a positive view of the United States.  Winning.  “The majority of Russians doesn’t even believe in the doping affair, not to mention this interference in the American elections,” Kolesnikov said. And many who believe it appreciate “the image of Putin as a strong, cunning man. ” “This is a   strategy for the Russian president,” he said. At least for now.

142246,217660,Yahoo says 1 billion user accounts hacked,Washington Post,Craig Timberg,2016-12-14,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161215003611/https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/yahoo-says-1-billion-user-accounts-hacked/2016/12/14/a301a7d8-b986-4281-9b13-1561231417c0_story.html
","  Yahoo said Wednesday that 1 billion user accounts    meaning most of the Internet giant’s customers worldwide    were hacked in 2013, leading to the release of user names, telephone numbers, dates of birth and other personal information.  News of the hack, coming after the announcement in September of a separate hack affecting 500 million accounts, means that Yahoo has been the victim of the two largest data breaches ever reported. Both have been announced since Yahoo agreed to sell its core businesses to telecommunications giant Verizon in July for $4. 8 billion.  The incident raised new questions among analysts regarding the viability of that deal and whether the valuation will need to be changed, especially if the hacks triggers litigation against the company.  ”This is another major blow,” said Jeff Kagan, a   telecommunications industry analyst. ”It throws into question what’s really going on at Yahoo. And if you don’t really know what’s going on at Yahoo, does Verizon have the guts to buy a potential bomb? This company could explode with major problems and major losses. ”  In the 2013 incident, Yahoo said that credit card and bank account numbers, which are stored separately, were not affected, but the breach did include some unencrypted ”security questions” that the company uses to verify the identities of users.  Yahoo also reported a separate incident Wednesday in which hackers used what the company called ”forged cookies” to gain access to some accounts, though it did not give the number. That incident, the company said, appeared to have links to the one announced in September. Law enforcement officials believe that breach, which happened in 2014, was likely the work of Russian hackers.  To minimize the damage, Yahoo is alerting affected customers and requiring them to change their passwords. But the scale of the hack and the time that has passed since it happened suggests that few of the company’s customers were unaffected. Given the size of the two hacks, many Yahoo users likely have had their information stolen two or even three times.  Yahoo has said it has more than 1 billion users worldwide, though the company’s fortunes have been sagging for years as other tech companies have snatched away pieces of the company’s search, email and other   businesses.  ”Yahoo encourages users to review all of their online accounts for suspicious activity and to change their passwords and security questions and answers for any other accounts on which they use the same or similar information used for their Yahoo account,” the company said in a statement. ”The company further recommends that users avoid clicking links or downloading attachments from suspicious emails and that they be cautious of unsolicited communications that ask for personal information.”  Regarding the deal with Verizon, Yahoo said in a statement, ”We are confident in Yahoo’s value and we continue to work towards integration with Verizon.”  Verizon spokesman Bob Varettoni said, “As we’ve said all along, we will evaluate the situation as Yahoo continues its investigation. We will review the impact of this new development before reaching any final conclusions. ”  Security experts also have long complained that Yahoo lagged the industry in adopting measures to protect its customers. The latest Yahoo breach was discovered after law enforcement officials shared with the company data that ”a third party” claimed was from Yahoo user accounts. The company, in conjunction with outside experts, verified that it was data stolen in August 2013, the company said in a statement.  The news, coming after markets closed on Wednesday, caused a late dip in Yahoo’s stock price, sending it down as much as 2. 7 percent in   trading.  “The fact that we now have two breaches implies that Yahoo security measures were inadequate. So it is more likely there will be future breaches uncovered,” said analyst Laura Martin, senior analyst entertainment and Internet at Needham & Company. “It sounds to me like they never knew about any of these breaches, which means they never fixed the problem. That implies that the assets are actually less valuable than we thought. ”  Staff writer Ellen Nakashima contributed to this report.   "

Bezos, once the target of Trump’s attacks, said he was “  to talk about innovation in this administration. ” Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg was also “excited to talk about jobs,” according to a pool report from the opening moments of the meeting. (Bezos is the owner of The Washington Post.) Trump was also on his best behavior during the roughly   meeting. “This is a truly amazing group of people,” he said. “There’s nobody like you in the world. In the world. There’s nobody like the people in this room. And anything we can do to help this go along, and we’re going to be there for you. ” But behind the cordiality was a sense of trepidation. Trump, both as candidate and   has used his perch to shame companies, and the consequences haven’t been trivial. When Trump tweeted earlier this month that he wanted to cancel Boeing’s $4 billion contract to build Air Force One, Boeing’s stock price took a hit. Trump has targeted Apple and other companies for manufacturing their products in China, and has called to raise tariffs on Chinese goods, a crucial issue for Silicon Valley companies that import widgets and other hardware components from China. At the meeting, which included the leaders of Google, Microsoft, Intel, Oracle, IBM, Cisco, and Tesla, Trump seemed willing to back down from a signature campaign promise to end   deals. “We’re going to make fair trade deals,” he told the executives. “We’re going to make it a lot easier for you to trade across borders. ” Also in attendance was Trump’s children and Wilbur Ross, his nominee for the Commerce Department. Last month, Trump negotiated with equipment maker Carrier, a division of United Technologies, to avoid losing 800 jobs to Mexico in exchange for $7 million in government subsidies. In the days leading up to the meeting, staff for the companies tried to parse whether the   Trump would try to use his leverage with them to do something similar. After the CEO roundtable, Trump met privately with Tesla chief executive Elon Musk and Apple chief executive Tim Cook. Tesla manufactures its vehicles in California but purchases components from China. Apple hardware largely comes from China. Attendees had a   and generally positive conversation, discussing issues from visas for   immigrants to trade issues to the cloud, according to people familiar with the discussion. Trump made cracking down on illegal immigration a central campaign promise, and called for an end to the   visa program during a presidential debate, though he later backtracked. Technology companies are some of the heaviest users of such visas. At the meeting, Trump seemed open to keeping the   visa program, a person familiar with the discussion said. The   also heaped praise on Facebook board and transition team member Peter Thiel, shaking his hand and calling him a “special guy. ” Trump made a point of saying that Thiel, who convened the meeting, nixed companies that were too small from attending. But one relatively small company with ties to Thiel made the cut: Palantir. Unlike the other companies in attendance, the     which Thiel founded in 2004, is private and had revenue last year of less than $300 million, according to a person familiar with the matter. A large portion of Palantir’s business involves contracts with federal agencies, and the company is currently engaged in a lawsuit with the Department of Defense over the right to compete for more contracts. The executives left as they arrived  —   wordlessly and quickly, striding through the lobby and ignoring press questions. Some smiled; Oracle’s Catz flashed a brief   when asked how the meeting went."

"," A secret U. S. military investigation in 2010 determined that Michael T. Flynn, the retired Army general tapped to serve as national security adviser in the Trump White House, “inappropriately shared” classified information with foreign military officers in Afghanistan, newly released documents show.  Although Flynn lacked authorization to share the classified material, he was not disciplined or reprimanded after the investigation concluded that he did not act “knowingly” and that “there was no actual or potential damage to national security as a result,” according to Army records obtained by The Washington Post under the Freedom of Information Act.  Flynn has previously acknowledged that he was investigated while serving as the U. S. military intelligence chief in Afghanistan for sharing secrets with British and Australian allies there. But he has dismissed the case as insignificant and has given few details. The Army documents provide the first official account of the case, but they are limited in scope because the investigation itself remains classified. Former U. S. officials familiar with the matter said that Flynn was accused of telling allies about the activities of other agencies in Afghanistan, including the CIA.       Donald Trump named retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn his national security adviser on Nov. 18, but Flynn has a history of making incendiary and Islamophobic statements that have drawn criticism from his military peers. (Peter   Washington Post)   The Army files call into question Flynn’s prior assertion that he had permission to share the sensitive information. During the presidential race, Flynn campaigned vigorously for Republican nominee Donald Trump and drew attention for his scalding attacks against Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton for mishandling classified material. Clinton was investigated by the FBI for allowing classified information to be transmitted on her private email server when she ran the State Department. No charges were filed against the former secretary of state, but the issue dogged her for more than a year.  At the Republican National Convention in July, Flynn called on Clinton to drop out of the race for putting “our nation’s security at extremely high risk with her careless use of a private email server. ” He egged on the partisan crowd in chants of “lock her up,” adding: “If I, a guy who knows this business, if I did a tenth, a tenth of what she did, I would be in jail today. ” Flynn did not respond to requests for comment. The office of the Army’s Judge Advocate General released a   summary of the investigation into Flynn in response to The Post’s Freedom of Information Act request for records of any misconduct allegations involving the retired   general. The U. S. military opened the investigation into Flynn in 2010 after receiving a complaint from an unnamed Navy intelligence specialist, according to the documents. The intelligence officer charged that Flynn violated rules by “inappropriately” sharing secrets with “various foreign military officers   officials in Afghanistan. ”             Caption   The men and women the   has selected for his Cabinet and White House team.

"," In making what is likely to be the most consequential decision of this transition period, Donald Trump couldn’t resist petty vindictiveness. Mitt Romney was briefly touted as the   to become secretary of state. After meeting with Trump over a meal, he pronounced himself “very impressed” by the man he had described as “a phony, a fraud” during the campaign. Trump did not accept this graciously. Citing a Trump friend, The Post reported that the   “enjoyed watching his dinner partner appear to grovel for the post. ” Memo to Trump’s Republican critics: Your initial instincts about Trump were right. Remember that catering to this man will bring only pain and humiliation. Memo to those claiming that everyone should give Trump a chance now that the people have spoken: Actually, “the people” didn’t make Trump president. They preferred Hillary Clinton by at least 2. 8 million votes. If Trump takes office, it’s the   system that will do it. And the   Trump has been as abusive and   as he was during the campaign. The opposition’s job is to stand up and prevent or mitigate the damage he could do to our country. Memo to the electoral college that votes next Monday: Our tradition  —   for good reason  —   tells you that your job is to ratify the    outcome of the election. The question is whether Trump, Vladimir Putin and, perhaps, Clinton’s   advantage give you sufficient reason to blow up the system. I don’t raise this lightly. The costs of breaking with 188 years of tradition would be very high. Alexander Hamilton’s Federalist 68 explaining the electoral college is widely cited by those who want electors to stage an   revolt. But we shouldn’t pretend that the electoral college as described by Hamilton bears any resemblance to the system we have used since the 1828 election, when statewide election of its members became almost universal. Yet defenders of the electoral college cannot claim that following the state results is an explicit “constitutional” obligation. The Constitution makes no mention of popular election of electors, leaving the manner of their selection to the states. It’s worth asking why the national popular vote should be seen as meaningless while the    popular vote should be regarded as sacred.  The best response is that, as the National Conference of State Legislatures reports, 29 states and the District of Columbia have statutes that try to bind electors to their voters’ preference. But these cover only 15 of the 30 states Trump carried (plus an elector from Maine) and the popular vote shows that turning on Trump would not be a rejection of the public will. Moreover, one passage from Federalist 68 seems eerily relevant to the present circumstance. Hamilton wrote that the electors could be a barrier against “the desire in foreign powers to gain an improper ascendant in our councils. ” Hamilton asked: “How could they better gratify this, than by raising a creature of their own to the chief magistracy of the Union?”  The CIA’s finding that Russia actively intervened in our election to make Trump president is an excellent reason for the electors to consider whether they should exercise their independent power. At the very least, they should be briefed on what the CIA knows, and in particular on whether there is any evidence that Trump or his lieutenants were engaged with Russia during the campaign. It’s not irrelevant that Trump himself said in July of Clinton’s emails: “Russia, if you’re listening, I hope you’re able to find the 30, 000 emails that are missing. ” By publicly inviting a foreign power to intervene in our election, Trump put himself ahead of the nation’s interest in holding an election that would be untainted by foreign meddling. It is one of many reasons conscientious electors might decide that Trump is unfit to be president and may even be a danger to the country. It will be entirely understandable if 270 or more of the electors pledged to Trump decide they are agents of their state’s voters, not independent actors. They can argue, fairly, that rejecting Trump would threaten the stability of our institutions. But the threat Trump himself presents to those institutions is why electors need to think hard before they make this decision. And if Trump prevails, as expected, this is also why vigilance rather than acquiescence is the primary duty of those unwilling to forget everything we believed about him before Nov. 8. He’s done nothing to change our minds. Just ask Mitt Romney.  Read more from E. J. Dionne’s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook.

"," What an outrage: On Sunday, the National Football League awarded the Tennessee Titans a win over the Denver Broncos because they scored more points, even though the Broncos got more total yards than the Titans.  Of course, this is a ridiculous complaint  —   but not much more ridiculous than the gripes we’re hearing about the fact that Donald Trump is   even though Hillary Clinton got 48. 2 percent of the total votes cast vs. 46. 1 percent for Trump. Her 2. 8 million   margin is one of the largest for the   loser in American history, or will be, once the electoral votes are officially cast on Monday. Still, it is fallacious to invoke this statistical byproduct of Nov. 8 to question the legitimacy of Trump’s victory  —   as opposed to that victory’s desirability, which is questionable indeed.  As all concerned knew going in, the object of the presidential election game is to win the most electoral votes in what are essentially 51   contests (the District included) just as the object of football is to score the most points. Gridiron teams would play differently under instructions to maximize yardage; candidates would campaign differently if maximizing national popular votes were the prime directive. Aiming for 270 electoral votes out of 538, both Clinton and Trump focused on 13 swing states; Trump won that     by 816, 000 votes.  Voters, too, behaved as they did based on the known rules. The popular vote reflects not only true preferences but also strategic voting (or abstention) by people in   states, such as   California and   Louisiana, who might have done something else in a   scenario.  Take Texas, a red state Trump won by roughly 800, 000 votes. His share in heavily Republican suburban counties lagged Mitt Romney’s 2012 performance by an average of eight percentage points; Clinton’s beat Obama’s by four, according to a data analysis by Sean Trende, senior election analyst for RealClearPolitics. Meanwhile, exit polling showed Trump beating Clinton by 13 points in a hypothetical   race, as opposed to the nine he won by in real life.  To Trende, this implies a lot of abstention or   voting by Republicans who were uncomfortable with Trump but might have swallowed their doubts if Clinton had a better chance to get the state’s 38 electoral votes  —   or win in a direct national election.  Who knows? Maybe Clinton’s 4. 3   edge in California would have been smaller if turnout weren’t affected by a factor unique to that state: multiple   referenda, including marijuana legalization and parole reform. There’s no use multiplying hypotheticals. While the Clinton   edge is so large it might represent what would have happened in a direct election, we can never be sure of that.  This is not to validate the electoral college per se. To the contrary, 2016 reinforces   concerns about the democratic adequacy of U. S. presidential elections.  What critics of the electoral college need to acknowledge, however, is that changing that one rule would bring many more changes along with it, some anticipated and welcome, some neither. Another sports analogy: College basketball introduced the   shot in 1986, vaguely intending to make the game more exciting and fairer, by rewarding difficult shots  —   and making it likelier that games could be decided or sent into overtime at the buzzer.   small schools could beat powerhouses loaded with    . “The 3” accomplished those goals  —   and replaced balletic maneuvering for inside shots with often sloppy, boring series of passes around the perimeter until someone takes, and usually misses, a long jumper. And then there are those thrilling pauses to check video of whether a shooter was standing on or beyond the   line. If we elect the president by popular vote, would it increase voters’ sense of engagement  —   or alienate them as candidates used more national media and less   retail politicking?  Would federal policy tilt in favor of   metropolitan areas, dooming wasteful farm subsidies  —   but increasing wasteful “urban development” aid? We could presumably not conduct a national popular vote under the   patchwork of election laws that controls presidential contests now. Ballots cast under different legal rules (for registration, early voting, voter ID, recounts and the like) would not be sufficiently equivalent. This, in turn, would require nationalized election law, at least for choosing the president and vice president, a complex legislative undertaking that could spawn equally complex litigation both before and after it took effect. None of this proves a direct popular vote would be better or worse than the existing system  —   just that it would be a whole new ballgame.  As for the game we have now, Clinton lost, and the sooner people accept that, the sooner they can move on to the task of limiting the damage Trump might do in office.

"," Indiana’s Thomas R. Marshall, who was America’s vice president 100 years ago, voiced  —   he plucked it from a Hoosier humorist  —   one of the few   utterances to issue from that office: “What this country needs is a good   cigar,” which would be $1. 11 in today’s currency. A century later, what the country needs is a $12   cup of coffee.  Or so Howard Schultz thinks. Betting against the man who built Starbucks to a market capitalization of $86 billion is imprudent.  Today, you cannot swing a dead cat without hitting a Starbucks store. There are 25, 000 in 75 countries, with another 12, 000 due by 2021, so Starbucks is not an elusive or exclusive experience. This poses a problem peculiar to affluent societies, and an opportunity. Seattle, where the original Starbucks was opened in 1971, now has a Starbucks Reserve Roastery and Tasting Room where customers can turn a cup of “ ” coffee into an experience  —   Starbucks sells experiences as much as coffee  —   of both conspicuous consumption and conspicuous connoisseurship. Bloomberg reports that for a pittance, a. k. a. $10, skinflints will be able to buy a   coffee, which presumably is an excellent thing, infused with nitrogen gas, which sounds like an acquired taste.  Many existing Starbucks are located to capture foot traffic in malls and shopping centers, which have been losing customers to online shopping. The original 30 roasteries  —   Reuters says they will be “” not merely tacky premium  —   will be destinations where people go to linger. So, by 2021, when there will be more normal Starbucks than McDonald’s, the few Starbucks Reserve Roasteries scattered from New York to Shanghai will be Starbucks’s entry into the positional economy.  Very pricey coffee is just a   variation on the familiar phenomenon of positional goods. They are necessarily, inherently enjoyments for the few. They exist because, particularly in the upper reaches of affluent societies, it is not love that makes the world go ’round, it is a compound of envy and pretentiousness.  Four decades ago, the economist Fred Hirsch distinguished between the material economy and the positional economy. Once a society has satisfied basic material needs (food, shelter, clothing) it turns yesterday’s luxuries (cars, air conditioning, college educations) into necessities. Because these are   commodities, such material prosperity is a leveling, egalitarian force. Positional competition is emphatically not. In the competition for an “elite” education or an “exclusive” vacation spot, one person’s success is necessarily a loss for many other persons because positional goods cannot be expanded indefinitely. Of course, Starbucks Roasteries could be expanded by the thousands, but this would make the “experience” banal and drain the stores of their positional power.  After elementary needs  —   food, shelter, clothing  —   are satisfied, consumption nevertheless continues, indeed it intensifies, because desires are potentially infinite. People compare themselves with their neighbors, envy their neighbors’ advantages and strive to vault ahead in the   sweepstakes.  The political equality of democratic societies leaves ample room for, and incites, social inequalities, which are coveted because they counter the leveling forces of mass affluence. Furthermore, as inherited privilege has been replaced by social rationality  —   Napoleon’s “careers open to talent,” a meritocracy based on skills and education  —   there is a residual human urge for irrational distinction. Such as savoring a $12 cup not just for the  —   let us stipulate  —   divine flavor but for the sheer fun of showing that you can and that your palate is so refined that merely very good coffee would be excruciating.  In any American city large enough to sustain a social ecosystem of snobbery, there is a magazine to guide fastidious consumers to “the five best craft breweries” or “the five best artisanal cheese shops. ” Heaven forfend that anyone should have to settle for the  . For discerning tipplers, there are artisanal ice cubes. In San Francisco, The Mill, a cafe and bakery, offers artisanal toast for $4 a slice. It is to die for, say the cognoscenti.  Where will the positional economy end? It won’t. Stanford University professor Francis Fukuyama notes that it is a peculiarity of human beings that they desire some things “not for themselves but because they are desired by other human beings. ” Hamsters have more sense. This characteristic of our species  —   the quest for recognition by distinguishing oneself from others  —   provides limitless marketing possibilities because for many wealthy people, “the chief enjoyment of riches consists in the parade of riches. ” So wrote Adam Smith in “The Wealth of Nations,” published in the resonant year of 1776.

"," A BLOWHARD blogger’s slur against      Melania Trump  —   the baseless allegation that she once worked as a   escort at a gentleman’s club in Italy, before meeting her husband  —   is a loathsome canard. So is the similarly “fake news” falsehood that a Northwest Washington pizzeria is a front for a child   ring run by Hillary Clinton, and so is the “birther” rubbish championed by Donald Trump, which sought to cast doubt on President Obama’s legitimacy as chief executive. So it is easy to sympathize with Ms. Trump, who has brought a defamation lawsuit in a Maryland court against the blogger, Webster Griffin Tarpley, who lives in Montgomery County, as well as the Daily Mail, a British tabloid that also published the lie. No one  —   no first lady, no president, no business owner and no private citizen  —   should be expected to tolerate an outrageous and fabricated smear campaign. Those who are on the receiving end of “fake news” have every right to strike back. Ms. Trump is hardly the first first lady to be tarred by hateful lies. Michelle Obama has had to contend with vile online attacks since her husband first ran for president, including a racist slur not long ago by a nonprofit official in West Virginia, Pamela Taylor, who referred to the first lady as an “ape in heels. ” Rachel Jackson, Mary Todd Lincoln and others also were the targets of cruel attacks. What has changed, owing to technology, is the slander’s reach. Hundreds or thousands might be exposed to a whispering campaign or a pamphlet; a blog post might go viral and slime its subject in the eyes and ears of millions. In Ms. Trump’s case, she demanded a retraction and apology from Mr. Tarpley, who published his sordid blog post on Aug. 2. He complied, whimpering that he’d just repeated a rumor that had appeared on the Internet  —   in other words, fake news, the fast food of ignoramuses everywhere. Despite the retraction and apology, Ms. Trump went ahead with the lawsuit, filed in Montgomery County Circuit Court this fall. Ms. Trump’s lawyers are justified in asserting that the allegations about Ms. Trump are false, and that Mr. Tarpley and the Daily Mail “broadcast their lies to millions of people throughout the United States and the world  —   without any justification. ” Whether the “fake news” peddler is a nobody in Gaithersburg or the   the product is noxious, and harm can be real. Whether a lawsuit by a future first lady against an unknown blogger is the optimal way to combat fake news is another question. As a public figure, Ms. Trump may face a legal hurdle in proving libel or defamation, which would require her to show that Mr. Tarpley published his post with malice or willful disregard of the truth. Her lawyer’s allegation in court papers, that the injuries to her reputation “are estimated at $150 million,” is preposterous; in fact, the lawsuit has probably done more to spread the fake news than the original blog post did.

","     Whether it concerns   Donald Trump’s refusal to release his tax returns, his unwillingness to remove conflicts of interest, his bizarre defense of Vladimir Putin on Russian hacking, his nomination of unqualified Cabinet members who happened to be big donors, his attacks on the free press, his threats and inducements to businesses to do his bidding or his announced disinterest in taking intelligence briefings, the reaction of the vast majority of Republicans is to hide or spin for Trump. The excuses for not objecting when he does egregious things include (these are real examples uttered by one or more Republicans on the Hill, operatives, advisers, etc. ):  He’s not president yet. (No, really, they say such a thing, as though he’ll be more responsive or Congress will have more leverage after he gets control over the IRS, CIA, FBI, etc.) Maybe he’ll do the right thing (e. g. divest). (Again, they utter this kind of rubbish despite heaps of evidence that he lacks any ethical compass.) But we need to get tax reform and repeal Obamacare. (As if reducing marginal tax rates would justify constitutional violations, or as if their forbearance will make Trump more agreeable on policy issues.) If we criticize, he won’t listen to us later. (No, seriously, they seem to believe that if they are patsies now, they will have influence later.) He doesn’t mean what he says. (We are back to not taking seriously the man who will be commander in chief.) He’s not going to get involved in specifics anyway. (Like negotiating over how many Carrier employees should stay in the United States?) He’s hiring good people. (Mike Flynn? Ben Carson? Stephen K. Bannon?) We cannot do anything. (Didn’t they run for weeks on a message of acting as a check on Trump?)  We find Trump’s   behavior to be entirely predictable  —   not normal or acceptable, but inevitable given his personality and temperamental and intellectual shortcomings. Republicans’ capitulation is far quicker and more complete than we imagined, we admit. Chalk it up to fear of Trump and his voters, to the unquenchable thirst for influence and power and to humans’ ability to convince themselves of practically anything. At times, one can only cringe at conservative “leaders” prostrating themselves before Trump. House Speaker Paul Ryan ( .) with unctuousness approaching Sen. Ted Cruz ( .) levels, exclaimed: “I’m impressed with how Donald Trump handles himself. I’m impressed with how magnanimous he is. I’m impressed with just his demeanor, his temperament. ” He all but offered to mow Trump’s lawn. Obviously, Ryan thinks flattery is going to work, but my goodness, have some  ! There is nothing wrong with praising politicians, especially those on your side, when they do something well, even if you oppose them on virtually everything else. To the contrary, Cabinet picks such as Jim Mattis, John Kelly, Elaine Chao and Mike Pompeo should be commended. When Trump says something bright (climate change might be real) it would be churlish to withhold approval. As we have said, backing away from idiotic campaign promises (e. g. deport 11 million people) should be cheered. That said, giving an ovation to highly problematic nominees such as Rex W. Tillerson, Goldman Sachs tycoons or an erratic personality such as Flynn or hiding under the covers while Trump tramples on the Constitution does the country a disservice and does not help Trump to improve his powers of discernment. The public is much more discriminating. According to a   Consult poll, for example, 79 percent think it is very or somewhat important for Trump to remove himself from business operations and by a 45 to 27 percent margin they think he should sell off all or some of his businesses. By a 60 to 21 percent margin they think he shouldn’t have business interests or holdings in foreign countries. In other words, there is no public pressure to discard all independent judgment in deference to the  . Trump, remember, lost the popular vote and remains a historically unpopular figure. Many of his actions and appointees will draw very negative reactions. There is no need for Republicans to wrap themselves around Trump; indeed, when things go haywire, that tactic likely will be a problem for the incumbent party in 2018. Republicans would be far wiser to stand their ground, at least once in a while, and draw the line in the sand on critical issues (e. g. honoring the Constitution). They might avoid looking quite so pathetic  —   and they might actually win on some issues applying leverage before he gets the powers of the presidency. Republicans and all lawmakers take oaths to the Constitution, not Trump or the party, and they are responsible to their own constituencies, not to the executive branch. They should behave as such."

Officials from the General Services Administration, which oversees federal real estate, said the agency  “does not have a position that the lease provision requires the   to divest of his financial interests. ” “We can make no definitive statement at this time about what would constitute a breach of the agreement, and to do so now would be premature,” the agency said. “In fact, no determination regarding the Old Post Office can be completed until the full circumstances surrounding the  ’s business arrangements have been finalized and he has assumed office. GSA is committed to responsibly administering all of the leases to which it is a party. ” The statement followed congressional Democrats’ assertion Wednesday that the   would violate a clause in the agreement if he did not surrender his interest upon entering office. Congressional Democrats led by Rep. Elijah E. Cummings (Md.) said early Wednesday that GSA officials had informed them that Trump would need to divest his interest in his D. C. hotel before being sworn in to avoid running afoul of a clause in the lease barring any “elected official of the Government of the United States” from deriving “any benefit” from the agreement. After the GSA said it had made no such determination, Cummings issued another statement explaining he was aware no breach had yet occurred and that GSA viewed it as a “hypothetical” issue until then. The    reflected the continuing confusion and rancor over how Trump will manage his private businesses once he takes public office. Aside from public stocks, Trump has resisted calls from ethics officials to sell stakes in his businesses, saying that he plans to let his children Don Jr. and Eric run them. He added this week on Twitter that “no new deals will be done during my term( s) in office. ”      Republican nominee Donald Trump spoke at the grand opening of Trump International Hotel. Protesters from the   and the Answer Coalition formed a picket line outside in protest. (The Washington Post)    But in the case of his D. C. hotel, the terms of his deal have come under particular scrutiny. His firm leases the Old Post Office Pavilion, the federally owned building where the hotel is located, from the GSA on a   deal. Congressional Democrats have been pressing GSA on that issue, as well as the possibility that by renting rooms to foreign leaders there Trump may be in violation of the “emoluments clause” of the Constitution, which bars U. S. officials from benefiting from foreign gifts, upon entering office. After Cummings and Reps.  Peter A. DeFazio (Ore.) Gerald E. Connolly (Va.) and André Carson (Ind.) all Democrats, wrote GSA Administrator Denise Turner Roth recently seeking answers, they say they were briefed by Roth’s deputy for public buildings last week. In a  letter early Wednesday, the Congress members wrote that the official “informed our staff that GSA assesses that Mr. Trump will be in breach of the lease agreement the moment he takes office on January 20, 2017, unless he fully divests himself of all financial interests in the lease for the Washington D. C. hotel. ” They say the official “made clear that Mr. Trump must divest himself not only of managerial control, but of all ownership interest as well. ” Trump spokesman Jason Miller told reporters Wednesday morning that the D. C. hotel “will be something that comes up at the press conference the   will now be holding in January. ” A spokeswoman for the Trump Organization did not immediately respond to a request for comment. According to the financial disclosure form Trump filed with the Federal Election Commission as a candidate, the   owns 76. 725 percent of the D. C. hotel project. Three of his children, Don Jr. Ivanka and Eric, each have 7. 425 percent of the project. There is a provision in the federal lease allowing Trump to sell or transfer his stake in the hotel to “any Trump Family Member. ” Selling it to an outside entity would likely require approval by the GSA. Some of the Obama administration’s options may be limited because that clause would not go into effect until Trump is sworn in, leaving the issue to his own administration; he will not technically be in breach of his lease until he himself takes office. GSA officials have said they rely on the Office of Government Ethics for guidance on how to address such conflicts. Despite the fact that the president is exempt from most financial    rules governing federal officials, on Monday Walter M. Shaub Jr. director of the ethics office, asserted that it was the “consistent policy” of previous presidents to abide by those rules and that Trump ought to as well. “Given the unique circumstancesof this Presidency, OGE’s view is that a President should comply with this law by divesting conflicting assets, establishing a qualified blind trust, or both,” he wrote, in a letter to Sen. Thomas R. Carper ( . ). Shaub acknowledged his office had no way of enforcing that opinion: “However, although every President in modern times has adopted OGE’s recommended approach, OGE has no power to require adherence to this tradition. ” The federal government’s best shot at forcing Trump’s hand may lie in the Old Post Office lease terms barring elected officials from deriving benefits from the deal. The boilerplate language, which ethics experts say dates to the Civil War, was not closely contemplated when negotiating the deal, according to federal officials familiar withe discussions. Even that language may not constitute an    case that would force Trump to sell. Georgetown University law professor Gregory Klass said recently that the clause may not technically trigger a violation of the lease when Trump enters office. “It could be read to prohibit an elected official from keeping a beneficial interest after elected  —   that is, to cover the Trump case. And the term’s clear purpose is to prevent conflicts of interest of that type. But the language is not crystalline,” he said. Other ethics experts have argued that even if Trump were to transfer ownership of his hotel stake to his children, through a lease change with the GSA, it wouldn’t prevent Don Jr. or Eric from passing on profits to their father during or after his administration. At a forum Wednesday on ethical issues facing the new administration, Cummings narrowed in on Trump’s foreign clients at the hotel, saying he cared “about every instance in which a foreign entity will see an opportunity to bestow illegal favors on the president that could degrade our democracy. ” “It is our obligation as members of congress to identity and hopefully prevent these types of constitutional violations,” Cummings said. Stephen Gillers, a professor at the New York University School of Law, said the emoluments provision “forbids a certain kind of conflict, conflicts that are between the president’s duty” and his business with foreign customers. As president, Gillers said, “he would be in violation of that clause. ” Follow Jonathan O’Connell on Twitter: @oconnellpostbiz      Vice   Mike Pence and   Donald Trump’s chief of staff Reince Priebus on Nov. 20 addressed Trump’s potential conflicts of interest.

","     November was abnormally mild in the United States, and snow was nowhere to be found. But winter has come on with a vengeance in December’s second week. Two pieces of the polar vortex have broken away from the Arctic region and will swirl through Canada, drawing frigid air into the Lower 48. The first pool of bitter cold air has already plunged into the Upper Midwest and will reach the   and Northeast on Thursday and Friday.  The second wave of punishing cold will crash into the Northern Plains on Saturday and Sunday before lifting over the Great Lakes on Sunday and Monday. The    blasts will cause temperatures to drop to 20 to 40 or more degrees below normal in affected areas. Although the cold is expected to set just a few records, many areas will experience some of their coldest December weather in several years. In between these two Arctic blasts, a sprawling storm system will develop in the Rockies and charge across the nation between Friday and the weekend, spreading snow   mixed precipitation from Denver to Washington and points north.

142256,217671,A treasure hunter found 3 tons of sunken gold — and can’t leave jail until he says where it is,Washington Post,Avi Selk,2016-12-14,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161215003611/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2016/12/14/a-treasure-hunter-found-3-tons-of-sunken-gold-and-cant-leave-jail-until-he-says-where-it-is/
","     Tommy G. Thompson was once one of the greatest treasure hunters of his time: A   diver who hauled a trove of gold from the Atlantic Ocean in 1988  —   dubbed the richest find in U. S. history. Years later, accused of cheating his investors out of the fortune, Thompson led federal agents on a great manhunt  —   pursued from a Florida mansion to a   hotel room booked under a fake name. Now Thompson’s beard has grayed, and he lives in an Ohio jail cell, held there until he gives up the location of the gold. But for nearly two years, despite threats and fines and the best exertions of a federal judge, no one has managed to make Thompson reveal what he did with the treasure.     A undated drawing of the S. S. Central America, which sank after sailing into a hurricane in 1857. (Library of  )  The wreck of the S. S. Central America waited 130 years for Thompson to come along. The steamer went down in a hurricane in 1857, taking 425 souls and at least three tons of California gold to the sea floor off South Carolina. Many tried to find it, but none succeeded until a young,   engineer from Columbus, Ohio, built an underwater robot called “Nemo” to pinpoint the Central America, then dive 8, 000 feet under the sea and surface the loot. “A man as personable as he was brilliant, Thompson recruited more than 160 investors to fund his expedition,” Columbus Monthly noted in a profile. He “spent years studying the ship’s fateful voyage   …     and developing the technology to plunge deeper in the ocean than anyone had before to retrieve its treasure. ” Thompson’s crew pulled up rare   coins, the ship’s bell and “gold bars . . . 15 times bigger than the largest California gold bar previously known to exist,” the Chicago Tribune reported in 1989. And 95 percent of the wreck site was still unexplored  —   potentially worth $400 million in gold alone, The Washington Post reported a year later. “The treasure trove is the richest in American history and the deepwater salvage effort the most ambitious ever undertaken anywhere. ” The expedition’s loot captured the country’s attention, as did the peculiarities of its leader  —   a   hybrid who worked on nuclear submarine systems before he hunted treasure. “Thompson is not exactly the romantic, swashbuckling sort,” Forbes wrote during the   recovery of the ship’s treasure. “He is scientific and methodical, with none of the P. T. Barnum that infuses (and inflates) other salvors. ”    Gold bars and coins from the S. S. Central America, first glimpsed in 1989. (Associated Press)  In his late 30s, during the height of his fame, Thompson said little in public and tended to play down his role in the discovery. “This gold is part of the largest treasure trove in American history,” he told reporters in 1989. “But the history of the S. S. Central America is also a rich part of our nation’s cultural treasury. ” He added: “It’s a celebration of American ideals: free enterprise and hard work. ” But before long, some of Thompson’s bankrollers began painting a very different picture of the man. Two of the expedition’s biggest investors took him to court in the 2000s, accusing him of selling nearly all the gold and keeping the profits to himself. When a federal judge ordered Thompson to appear in 2012, he didn’t show. An arrest warrant was issued, but the man who found a   shipwreck had disappeared.  There followed a   manhunt for what a top U. S. Marshal called “perhaps one of the smartest fugitives” the agency had ever chased. Thompson had “almost limitless resources and approximately a ten year head start” in the chase, U. S. Marshal for the Southern District of Ohio Peter Tobin said in a statement. Thompson and his girlfriend had been living for years in a Florida mansion, paying rent with cash that was damp and moldy from the earth it had been buried in, The Post’s Abby Phillip reported last year. The couple had fled by the time authorities found the house. Government records detailed what they’d left behind: disposable cellphones, money straps stamped “$10, 000” and a guide on evading law enforcement titled “How to be Invisible. ”    An undated photograph of Thompson made available by U. S. Marshals in January 2015.  Thompson was finally caught in January 2015, after agents tracked his girlfriend to a $   hotel near West Palm Beach, The Post reported at the time. In a celebratory statement, Tobin said the U. S. Marshals had used “all of our resources and ingenuity” to find the treasure hunter. But they didn’t find the treasure. Thompson’s investors, who originally expected to make tens of millions of dollars from the venture, said that they believe he had hundreds of gold coins secreted in a trust account for his children. At first, their search for the coins looked promising. Thompson pleaded guilty to contempt of court in April 2015, according to the Columbus Dispatch. He said the coins were in Belize and agreed to reveal their exact location. But that didn’t happen. Thompson’s attorney said last month that his client couldn’t remember who he gave the gold to, even after poring over thousands of pages of documents related to the treasure, according to the Dispatch. A federal judge ruled that Thompson was faking memory problems, the newspaper reported, and has held him in an Ohio jail cell for a year. Thompson could remain behind bars until he talks, the Associated Press reported, and is being fined $1, 000 a day in the meantime. “Who knows  —   he might have an epiphany,” U. S. District Judge Algenon Marbley remarked Monday when he ordered Thompson to answer questions about the gold’s location. But so far, the S. S. Central America’s treasure remains missing for the second time in two centuries. And perhaps the only man able to find it remains as silent as the lost sailors of that old wreck."
142257,217672,Some NFL coaches want to outlaw one of the most exciting plays in football,Washington Post,Adam Kilgore,2016-12-14,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161215003611/https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/redskins/some-nfl-coaches-want-to-outlaw-one-of-the-most-exciting-plays-in-football/2016/12/13/c544f468-c18a-11e6-9578-0054287507db_story.html
"," As Justin Tucker measured his steps to line up a field goal Monday night, Shea McClellin stood on the other side of the line, a visual counterbalance to Tucker, and measured his own. Tucker had not missed a kick all season. The New England Patriots had discovered secrets Baltimore’s field goal unit had hidden in plain sight. In the NFL, even the most routine plays can unfurl an entire universe. McClellan and the Patriots had studied film for weeks for what happened next, one of the most exciting  —   and controversial  —   plays in football: McClellin sprinted, leaped over both lines and blocked Tucker’s field goal attempt. The leap helped key New England’s victory and provided the most recent example of a rare, exhilarating play gaining popularity in the NFL.  For some, The Leap is a delight, a perfectly legal combination of exemplary teamwork and thrilling athleticism. For others, The Leap is a menace, a   trick that places players’ safety at unnecessary risk.   The play has made a distinct impact on this NFL season. In Week 10, Broncos special teamer Justin Simmons leaped over the New Orleans Saints’ line late in the fourth quarter and blocked what would have been a   extra point. Teammate Will Parks scooped the ball and ran to the end zone for a   conversion, flipping a   deficit to a   lead, effectively stealing a victory.    The hands of Broncos safety Justin Simmons, right, as he blocks the Saints‘ Wil Lutz’s extra point attempt last month. (Jeff  )  “Just time it up right,” McClellin said Monday night. “That’s all you’ve got to do: time it up right. ” But The Leap contains so much more, in both preparation and execution, beginning with the technique of the most overlooked player on most NFL rosters.  “It’s all about how the snapper in that part of the play does his job,” Redskins long snapper Nick Sundberg said.  As Sundberg explained, NFL teams teach two techniques for long snappers. The first is to snap and immediately lift your head, then lean to one side to help guards block. When Sundberg arrived with the Redskins in 2010, special teams coach Danny Smith repeated the same instructions: Chest up, head up, arms out.  “As soon as the ball comes out of my hands, my head’s coming up,” Sundberg said.  For that reason, Sundberg does not worry about an opponent leaping over him to block a field goal try. The   leaper would risk clipping his cleat on Sundberg and falling or bowling him over and drawing a penalty.  “I don’t keep it in the back of my mind at all,” Sundberg said. “I trust my technique will take care of it, and teams won’t try that against us, because of the way I protect  . ” The other way teams teach long snapping is for the snapper to rifle the ball between his legs, then put his fists on the ground. It allows for the snapper to buttress himself and maintain leverage against rushing defenders. It’s also a relic from the years before the NFL defined snappers as defenseless players, thus making it illegal to smash them immediately after a snap.  “Back then, they could tee off and destroy us,” said Mike Leach, who retired last year after long snapping for 16 seasons, the last seven in Arizona . “So coaches used to teach, ‘Snap and get low, try to get as low as you can to brace yourself.’ There’s still some of that held over teaching that technique, even though in my opinion, there’s no need for that anymore. ” So, guess which technique Ravens long snapper Morgan Cox uses? He leans forward, with his fists on the ground, after he releases the ball. In fact, the entire Ravens line kneels low to protect on field goals.  “If you go through all 32 teams and watch who has the lowest pad level in the NFL, Baltimore is easily No. 1,” Sundberg said. “Their guards, tackles, tight ends, they’re all in a   stance. I was there in 2009, and they preach low, low, low  —   low man wins. You know how the Patriots are. They’re always scheming and  . ”  Two weeks before the Patriots played Baltimore, McClellin said, special teams coach Joe Judge started to implement the play. Defensive tackles Malcolm Brown and Alan Branch charged forward low to the ground, inducing Baltimore’s interior lineman to drop their pads even lower. Because Tucker always took his steps and started his approach to the same beat, McClellin could focus on his perfectly timed sprint and leap over the line just as Cox threw the ball between his legs.  “It looked like they timed our snap and the guy made a hell of a play,” Tucker said. “I don’t know what happens in their meetings, but the guy made a good play on the ball. ” “Joe Judge did a great job of designing the play,” Patriots Coach Bill Belichick said. “We worked on it all week and just felt like we could take advantage of that. Shea really executed it perfectly, as did the guys up front. ” The play delivered everything a fan could want from football: surprise, action, choreography, athleticism. And yet, some within the league want the play banned.  No one doubts the present legality of The Leap. Rule 12, Section 3 of the NFL rulebook details what is prohibited on a kick: jumping or standing on a teammate; placing a hand on another player to gain extra height; lifting a teammate; and leaping over players at the line of scrimmage and landing on someone. The operative clause is “and landing on someone. ” And some coaches would like to see that qualifier eliminated. The NFL’s Competition Committee has discussed the play in the past and plans to review it again this offseason, one league official said. “It’s bad for football,” Cardinals Coach Bruce Arians said earlier this season, after Seattle’s Bobby Wagner jumped over Arizona’s line to try to block a kick. “Because what you’re going to have to do now is start having centers raise their face up and get kicked in the face. And things that are just dangerous to the players. I think it’s a dangerous play as it is and should be taken out of the game. ”  Snappers themselves don’t see it that way. Foremost, they assume risk upon signing a contract. “I don’t know if there is a safe play in football, if you look up the definition of ‘safe,’ ” Sundberg said.  Because Sundberg espouses the technique of lifting his head after snaps, he would be at risk of a   leaper kicking or kneeing him in the face. He’s willing to live with that result, protected in his mind by the rulebook.  “It’s a   penalty and unnecessary roughness,” Sundberg said. “All sorts of things are happening for the good of our team if that happens. That’s the risk I take on every play in the game. . . . I don’t think you can say just from a safety standpoint, ‘It’s too dangerous, get it out of the game.’ You could probably come up with 100 different plays before that one. ” Said Leach: “I don’t see any reason why it should be illegal. If a guy wants to time it up to gain an advantage, or if a guy wants to take the risk and jump over somebody, it’s up to the team who’s kicking the field goal to do something about it. Change up their rhythm or come up with a different technique. ” For now, at least, the play remains legal. It could even tilt, if not decide, a playoff game. The defender who jumps will receive the most attention. But he will know it takes so much more to make the leap.  "
142258,217673,"Trump doesn’t threaten only President Obama’s legacy. He could ruin Michelle Obama’s, too.",Washington Post,Caitlin Dewey,2016-12-14,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161215003611/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/12/14/trump-doesnt-just-threaten-barack-obamas-legacy-he-could-ruin-michelles-too/
","         The threat Donald Trump poses to President Obama’s legacy was well established from his earliest days on the campaign trail, when the businessman promised that he would abolish several of Obama’s core policies. But the president is not the only Obama whose achievements   Trump could roll back. The incoming president also could undo the substantial public health and nutrition changes accomplished with the urging of Michelle Obama. The first lady has spent the past eight years championing   initiatives, pushing an aggressive policy and   agenda that has played a part in changing how millions of Americans, particularly schoolchildren, eat. In a 2010 speech announcing her signature program, Let’s Move! Obama described her goal as nothing less than “solving the problem of childhood obesity in a generation. ” Experts say her policies have contributed to several positive trends, including the overall obesity rate among young people leveling off in recent years. Children’s diets also have improved measurably, a recent Brown University study found, particularly when it comes to eating more whole grains, seafood, dairy and fruit. But now that Trump will soon take power  —   Trump of the   taco bowl and   Porterhouse fame  —   lobbyists, activists and outgoing administration officials fear that the   and his and his advisers’ skepticism of government regulation, will uproot the healthy food movement Obama has championed. At stake is not only her personal legacy, experts say, but efforts to reverse the nation’s obesity epidemic. “The Obama administration made a valiant effort to make progress,” said Marion Nestle, a prominent food policy activist and academic. “But there isn’t anything [Trump] couldn’t undo, if he wanted. ” Advocates fear that three achievements could be on the chopping block: rules that require chain restaurants to put calorie counts on menus, stricter nutrition standards for school lunches, and an update to the nutrition labels that appear on packaged foods. All three were championed by the first lady and enacted by Democratic majorities in Congress. School lunch reforms also had early bipartisan support, passing unanimously in the Senate. In the years since, however, both congressional Republicans and industry groups have come to see the regulations as overly strict or wasteful. When Republicans won control of the House in 2010, and the Senate four years later, opposition to the first lady’s nutrition agenda became more vocal.    (Washington Post illustration; iStock)  The fight for school lunch The most visible piece of Obama’s agenda is school lunch reform, which affects the meals of 31 million children. The First Lady began lobbying for better school nutrition standards shortly after her husband took office, seizing on the fact that the law governing the national school lunch program came up for renewal in 2010. With her urging, the new law    dubbed the Healthy,   Kids Act    required that the lunch program revise its nutritional guidelines for the first time in 15 years.    (USDA)  As a result, schools across the U. S. now offer students milk, whole   foods, and a variety of fruits and vegetables, plus limit the amounts of calories,   and salt that kids get in cafeterias. “When we talk about raising a healthier generation, this is what we mean,” Obama said last May. “And it’s happening before our very eyes   …     They’re developing a set of habits and preferences that will set them on a healthy path for the rest of their lives. ” While the measure was popular when it passed, sentiment shifted as the Department of Agriculture began to release concrete requirements. The School Nutrition Association, a powerful industry group which had been an important supporter of the legislation, reversed course over concerns that the new standards were expensive and unpopular with students. “It’s not up to the government to dictate the personal dietary choices of individuals,” said Daren Bakst, a research fellow at the Heritage Foundation. “We want these decisions made at the local level. That’s the   position. ” In Congress, detractors like Rep. Robert Aderholt ( .) and Sen. John Hoeven ( . D.) have introduced legislation and taken other steps to undermine or delay some of the law’s main provisions, including limits on refined grains and sodium. When the child nutrition bill came up for reauthorization in 2015, House Republicans attempted to gut both the nutritional standards and a measure intended to increase program access in   schools. Negotiations fell through earlier this month, which means the issue will be taken up by the next Congress. The new nutritional standards will remain in place until then. While it’s too early to guess at what the next child nutrition bill could look like, Aderholt, one of the staunchest critics of school lunch reform, has said he expects changes. His office declined to specify what those changes would be. Much of this uncertainty springs from the fact that Trump has never publicly spoken on school lunches or nutrition policy, though plenty of lobbyists and administration officials are scrutinizing the tea leaves behind closed doors. They note that Trump’s agricultural advisory committee includes Aderholt and Texas Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller, who reintroduced   to that state’s schools. The man leading his Department of Agriculture transition team, Joel Leftwich, is a former lobbyist for PepsiCo. Trump just nominated the CEO of Hardee’s and Carl’s Jr. to head the Department of Labor. Trump has said he personally eats fast food several times a week and has extolled the virtues of McDonald’s    though his 2004 book “Think Like a Billionaire” also preached the value of a balanced, minimally processed diet.  The Trump transition team did not respond to a request for comment. Nutrition and menu labels still in play The same ambiguity surrounds   rules, which require chain establishments that serve prepared food to also display those foods’ calorie counts. The First Lady’s advisers have been credited with shepherding the   requirement, which passed as part of the Affordable Care Act and will go into effect next year.  Multiple studies have found that people consume fewer calories when their menus display calorie counts. But some industry groups, particularly those representing grocery stores, theaters and other   establishments that aren’t strictly “restaurants,” are unhappy the rules apply to them. Their defenders in government have argued that the requirements are a financial burden. They could potentially see relief under the Trump administration, given that he and Tom Price, his nominee for Secretary of Health and Human Services, favor repealing the ACA. Price has also said government should play a smaller role in regulating industry. That stance could also affect other nutritional regulations under the purview of the Food and Drug Administration, a department of HHS    namely, the new Nutrition Facts labels, which the First Lady debuted, to great fanfare, last summer. Debra Eschmeyer, the executive director of Let’s Move! described the update as one of Obama’s ”monumental achievements.”    (Food and Drug Administration)  The labels emphasize calories and serving size and display “added sugars” for the first time, emphasizing the sweeteners and syrups that manufacturers add to many products during processing. They are unpopular with the sugar industry and aren’t slated to go live until July 2018. Congress could delay them through next year’s budget bill if they’re not already delayed or weakened by the agency. “We are on high alert for attempts to remove ‘added sugars’ or delay the update to the Nutrition Facts,” said Margo Wootan, the director of nutrition policy at the Center for Science in the Public Interest. The future of child obesity Advocates fear any reversal of the First Lady’s nutrition policies could harm the fight against the obesity epidemic. Progress on this front has already been slow: In 2013, 38 percent of American adults were obese, as were 17 percent of children    a figure that has not changed substantially over the past decade.  Certain groups of children have seen progress, however, particularly children under five years old and children under five who participate in nutrition assistance programs. Miriam Nelson, a public health researcher who has advised several administrations on child obesity and nutrition, said those gains could be erased if Trump rolled back programs like healthy school lunches. “We can only speculate, but I’m very worried,” Nelson said. “The trend down is not real steep. It’s a fragile shift. ” Still, there’s some reason for hope among nutrition experts. Wootan points out that many of Obama’s reforms have been popular with voters: a 2015 poll by the W. K. Kellogg Foundation found that 86 percent support the stricter   standards, while a 2015 AP poll found that more than half of Americans support menu calorie labels. Eschmeyer, of Let’s Move! said she felt ”optimistic” that public sentiment on obesity, as well as momentum in the marketplace, would ensure the First Lady’s reforms remained for the  . ”The takeway is that we’ve seen tremendous conversation and cultural shift,” she said. ”I’m really excited for the future of food in this space.” Wootan and other experts say we’ll know more about the fate of Michelle Obama’s legacy in a matter of weeks. Trump’s pick for Secretary of Agriculture will reveal a great deal about where he stands. But Nestle says she’ll be watching for a smaller, more symbolic indicator: what happens to Obama’s White House garden. The First Lady recently called the garden “a symbol of the hopes that we all hold of growing a healthier nation for our children. ” “His removing that would be equivalent to Reagan removing the solar panels installed under the Carter administration,” Nestle said. “It has enormous symbolic value. And that would be sad. ” You might also like: A healthful legacy: Michelle Obama looks to the future of ‘Let’s Move’ A widely held belief about childhood obesity that simply isn’t true Researchers have discovered a surprisingly simple way to get kids to eat more veggies"

","  In NEWTOWN, Conn.         They had promised to try everything, so Mark Barden went down into the basement to begin another project in memory of Daniel. The families of Sandy Hook Elementary were collaborating on a Mother’s Day card, which would be produced by a marketing firm and mailed to hundreds of politicians across the country. “A ” the organizers had called it. Maybe if Mark could find the most arresting photo of his    son, people would be compelled to act.  It hardly mattered that what Mark and his wife, Jackie, really wanted was to ignore Mother’s Day altogether, to stay in their pajamas with their two surviving children, turn off their phones and reward themselves for making it through another day with a glass of Irish whiskey neat. “Our purpose now is to force people to remember,” Mark said, so down he went into his office to sift through 1, 700 photos of the family they had been.  The Bardens had already tried to change America’s gun laws by studying the Second Amendment and meeting with President Obama in the Oval Office. They had spoken at tea party rallies, posed for People magazine and grieved on TV with Katie Couric. They had taken advice from a public relations firm, learning to say “magazine limits” and not “magazine bans,” to say “gun responsibility” and never “gun control. ” When none of that worked, they had walked the halls of Congress with a bag of 200 glossy pictures and beseeched lawmakers to look at their son: his auburn hair curling at the ears, his front teeth sacrificed to a soccer collision, his arms wrapped around Ninja Cat, the stuffed animal that had traveled with him everywhere, including into the hearse and underground. Almost six months now, and so little had gotten through. So maybe a Mother’s Day card. Maybe that.  Mark turned on his computer and began looking for the right picture. “Something lighthearted,” he said. “Something sweet. ” He had been sitting in the same chair Dec. 14, when he received an automated call about a Code Red Alert, and much of the basement had been preserved in that moment. Nobody had touched the foosball table, because Daniel had been the last to play. His books and toy trains sat in their familiar piles, gathering dust. The basement had always been Daniel’s space, and some days Mark believed he could still smell him here, just in from playing outside, all grassy and muddy. Now it was Daniel’s face staring back at him on the computer screen, alit in an orange glow as he blew out seven candles on a birthday cake in September. “Oh God. His last birthday,” Mark said, rubbing his forehead, scanning to the next photo, knowing the chronology that came next. Daniel dressed as an elf for Halloween. Daniel grinning after his hair was cut short on Dec. 4. Daniel in a video taken a week before his death, wearing reindeer horns and carrying cookies to the neighbor’s house. “Bye, Dad,” he was saying. Next came a photo Mark had taken early that last morning. He and Daniel had been lying on the couch, half asleep, after the rest of the family had left for school. Daniel had noticed how the sunrise and the Christmas lights were reflecting on the window, like a    kaleidoscope. “Wow,” he had said. Mark had grabbed his camera and taken a picture of the window, and now he was searching that picture for a trace of Daniel’s reflection in the glass, zooming in, running his fingers against the screen.  “He has to be in here,” Mark said. Maybe he had taken another. He flipped to the next picture, but it was from four days later, of a police car parked in front of their house.     Mark Barden, at home, thinking about Daniel. (Linda   Washington Post)     Jackie Barden stares into the yard where Daniel played. (Linda   Washington Post)    It sometimes felt to Mark in these moments like his grief was still deepening, like the worst was yet to come. After the gunfire, the funerals, the NRA protests and the congressional debates, they were finally coming into the lonely quiet. They were coming to the truth of what Newtown would become. Would it be the transformative moment in American gun policy that, in those first days, so many had promised? Or another Columbine, Virginia Tech, Gabby Giffords, Aurora  —   one more proper noun added to an   list? The FBI had closed its temporary Newtown office. Politicians in Washington were moving on to other issues. Scariest of all to Mark, he was starting to forget little things, too, losing pieces of Daniel to the recesses of his mind, so he had started a journal to log memories before they disappeared.  “I’m always one minute farther away from my life with Daniel,” he had written one day. “The gulf keeps getting bigger. ” He returned upstairs with four photos and brought them to Jackie in the living room. “For the Mother’s Day card,” he said. She looked at one that showed Daniel at 4, his freckled arms wrapped around her neck and his face buried into hers. She gasped. She touched her neck. “It physically hurts,” she said, reaching for Mark. “Stomach, arms, legs, chest. ” She had developed a habit in the last months of what her counselor called “defensive delusions,” when she would imagine for a few hours that Daniel was away at a friend’s house. Pretending helped her summon the energy to return a few   or cook dinner, but the easiness of the mental game was starting to scare her. “Is it normal?” Jackie had asked the counselor at their last appointment. “Is this something other people do?”  “There is no normal,” the counselor had said. “There are only hard days to get through. ” So now, on this hard day, Jackie stared at the photo and considered whether to release another intimate moment to the world.  “Will it make a difference?” she asked Mark.  “I don’t know,” he said.

","     Can you imagine coming    with a wave six stories tall? In February 2013, a buoy in the North Atlantic measured a towering   (19 meters) wave between Iceland and the United Kingdom. In an announcement Tuesday, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) concluded it was “the highest significant wave height” ever recorded by a buoy, surpassing the previous highest wave, measured at 59. 96 feet in December 2007, also in the North Atlantic. The giant wave formed in the wake of a powerful cold front charging across the Atlantic. Winds gusted to 50 mph. “This is the first time we have ever measured a wave of 19 meters. It is a remarkable record,” said Wenjian Zhang, assistant secretary general of the WMO. Wave height is defined as the distance between crest (or top) of one wave and the trough (or bottom) of the next.    People watch waves close to the harbor wall at Porthcawl, South Wales, as Storm Desmond hits the United Kingdom on Dec. 5, 2015. (Ben   via AP)  The WMO explained the world’s biggest waves typically occur in the North Atlantic in winter as storms explosively intensify. “The area from the Grand Banks underwater plateaus off the Canadian coast around Newfoundland to south of Iceland and to the west coast of the UK, including the Rockall Trough, are prime candidates for wave records,” it said. USA Today reported that larger waves have probably occurred than this   behemoth, but they have not been measured.

The lag between the WMO announcement of the record wave and its occurrence on Feb. 4, 2013, resulted from the time needed to analyze and verify the data."

","         NEW YORK  —   The performance artist who calls herself Zardulu told us where we were to meet: a quiet stretch of Prospect Park next to a pond, which she’d circled for us in red on a map. She approached in a full purple robe, wearing a turban, her face covered in a bearded mask. Zardulu looked a little bit like an old animatronic fortune teller, recently escaped from a carnival machine. We were there to talk to Zardulu about “fake news,” a topic that went from the Internet’s fringes to one of national concern in the days after Donald Trump was elected president. Zardulu, whose expertise in fabrication will become clearer in just a moment, wanted to tell us a different kind of story, one a lot less partisan. It was about a raccoon and an alligator.  “You may remember the news item. Or perhaps not,” Zardulu began. “A raccoon spotted riding an alligator in the Everglades. ” In case you don’t remember: In 2015, there was an incredible viral photograph, a “lucky” shot, that showed a raccoon perched on the back of a swimming alligator. A man named Richard Jones told the local news that he’d snapped the picture himself, and a lot of Florida news outlets ran with it. The story spread to larger publications. It went viral.   The raccoon riding an alligator is the most Florida thing since mortgage fraud. pic. twitter.   —   Benjamin Freed (@brfreed) June 14, 2015   There were plenty of doubters, of course. But also many believers, people who would prefer to live in a world where a raccoon could use a predator as a ferry. And that preference is exactly what Zardulu understands so well. “I staged the raccoon and the alligator,” Zardulu said. The animals are taxidermied; she sprayed each with a commercial product used to waterproof leather to protect them from the water. Zardulu showed us photographs of the setup, and some of herself, in costume, clutching the animals.    (Courtesy of Zardulu)  “I consider it a great success by my standards. ” The moment that particularly pleased Zardulu happened when two very different men talked about her work: “Bill O’Reilly and Bill Maher. On the exact same night,” Zardulu said. “Two men with as opposite opinions as they have audiences, momentarily captivated by the same image. ” She added: “So that’s a pretty good myth. ” *** The story of Zardulu begins like this: The anonymous artist, who closely guards her identity, once worked in secret, staging scenes such as the raccoon and the alligator, never revealing to the world what she had done. She refers to her creations as “myths,” their purpose is to be “pearls of merriment for the world to enjoy. ” The philosophy behind her work is Zardulism. There is a manifesto.  Earlier this year, the New   blog Gothamist talked to one of her collaborators, who revealed that Zardulu had trained at least one rat to perform incredible feats  —   such as taking a “selfie” on a sleeping subway commuter’s cellphone, and dragging a slice of pizza down the stairs. (Yes, Zardulu has said that Pizza Rat was performed by a trained rat as well).  She was reluctant then to reveal any of the secrets of her work, asking the Gothamist reporter, “Why wake the world from a beautiful dream when the waking world is all so drab?” Zardulu now feels a little differently. She believes that Zardulism “will be more effective, and will last longer, and will inspire greater participation in others, if occasionally the veil is lifted. ” The Zardulu mask disguises the identity of its wearer, but it is not opaque. Her real eyes are visible from a short distance, as is and just enough of her mouth to know when she smiles. Zardulu speaks slowly, either as an affectation of mystery, or because she carefully chooses her words. To meet her, we agreed not to reveal who she is  —   and, for that matter, we do not know her real name, or whether Zardulu is the work of one artist. She has said before that she was born in Manhattan in 1971. That is as lifted as the veil gets. She has recruited others to help with some of her myths, but the most important collaborator is one who doesn’t know she’s there at all. The photograph of the raccoon and the alligator, she suggested to me, came from a “naive collaborator,” someone who believed what he saw and documented it. As for Pizza Rat, “I don’t believe that anyone who saw Pizza Rat knew what they were seeing,” Zardulu told me. (Matt Little, the man who filmed Pizza Rat, insists that the video was not staged.) She’d rather not say whether the person who filmed Selfie Rat worked knowingly with her to create the myth. “Many of my stories exist only for the people who see them,” she said. “Or the people who have access to those people’s iPhone camera rolls. ” She said there are several dozen Zardulu myths in the world, only a small portion of which have become fully realized viral stories. Of course, Zardulu’s most reliable naive collaborators have been journalists, the ones who unwittingly help the rest of the world find the stories she’s told. When Zardulu and I began to speak, first through Twitter Direct Messaging, she asked me: “Do you like fairies?” *** Arthur Conan Doyle desperately wanted to believe that the Cottingley Fairies were real. He’d heard of the five photographs taken by two young cousins, appearing to show them playing with the mystical creatures. In 1920, he wrote about the fairies for Strand magazine, convinced that they were genuine. He wrote: “The recognition of their existence will jolt the material   mind out of its heavy ruts in the mud, and will make it admit that there is a glamour and a mystery to life. ” Some, like Doyle, believed it. Others were skeptical, but the girls maintained that the photos were genuine for quite some time. “It was decades before anyone used the term hoax,” Zardulu told me, “when eventually the girls came forward and admitted what they had done. I think that it is delightful. Absolutely delightful to have given the world such a gift. And it does indeed resonate with me particularly that the truth [did come out. ]” “Fans of the artist Banksy love his work because they don’t know who created it. Fans of mine love my work because they don’t know it was created,” she said. *** As Zardulu began to talk more about her myths, she created a new one about herself: that Zardulu is always capable of more, of feats you haven’t even yet imagined. See her once, and suddenly Zardulu is everywhere. Talking to her in Prospect Park convinced me to never look at a subway rat the same way again. I asked someone who knew Zardulu’s mythmaking better than most to help me figure out what, exactly, that means. “Anytime something impossibly weird happens, we get a rash of emails and tweets,” said Alex Goldman, the   of Reply All, a podcast that focuses on Internet abnormalities. The show had an entire episode on Zardulu. “When something feels incomprehensible, people think it could be her. ” It is true that Zardulu’s work is very different from the sort of “fake news” that became a   object of fury  —   the latter often seek to profit, no matter the harm it causes, while Zardulu says she only wants to brighten the world. But there is one parallel: Once the sleight of hand becomes visible, it is easy to move from thinking a story has been fabricated to a   that makes you question the legitimacy of everything you see. In Zardulu’s case, I wondered whether it was possible to have a truthful conversation about fabrication. So I asked her whether, or why, I should believe the story she told to me. “I’m not in the business of telling anyone what they should or shouldn’t do or what they should or shouldn’t believe,” Zardulu answered. “Just offering up one possibility. ” More Reading:   How the war against “fake news” backfired  After 10 years of viral videos, what OK Go has learned about the Internet Meet the Internet’s ‘greatest liar,’ whose Twitter death hoaxes have fooled millions   "

","        Crowds jostle to get on a bus to a place where they hope they can board a boat, operated by smugglers, that will sneak them into Nicaragua. (Michael Robinson   Washington Post)  In September, about 2, 000 people were packed together in a refugee camp in Peñas Blancas, Costa Rica, a town sharing a border with Nicaragua. They were living in tents doing what they could to survive, hoping to get to the next destination along a burgeoning path of migration moving into North America. It is a scene like many all over the world. Except this time, the   camp has materialized in a country not often associated with migration. The Washington Post’s Michael Robinson Chavez was there to witness the scene. As The Post’s Chico Harlan has reported in “7, 000 miles to salvation,” a surging number of migrants  —   mostly from Haiti and Africa  —   are going by bus and by foot from the Amazon to the Rio Grande, marking a new and dangerous pattern of movement into North America. The   laborers and their families are part of about 20, 000 people making their way across 10 countries, caught between a sustained recession in Brazil and an increasingly stingy U. S. border. Chavez is no stranger to camps like the one in Costa Rica. He covered migrant camps in Kenya (2002) Iraq (2003 to 2004) and Lebanon (2006). But this time, what he was seeing was different. “The fact that this place exists in a peaceful country like Costa Rica shows just how widespread migration has become,” Chavez said.

","          CHARLESTON, S. C.  —   Dylann Storm Roof, a   dropout who learned to hate black people on the Internet, was convicted Thursday of 33 counts of federal hate crimes for slaughtering nine black parishioners at a church Bible study meeting here last year. A federal jury took less than two hours to reach its decision, following a   trial in which Roof, 22, a   white supremacist, chose to remain silent and motionless amid a barrage of testimony and evidence so thorough and devastating that his mother, watching from the third row, suffered a heart attack on the first day. “He executed them because he believes they are nothing but animals,” prosecutor Nathan Williams said in his closing argument, addressing a somber jury that had seen   photos of all the dead, including Susie Jackson, 87, the oldest victim, into whom Roof had emptied an entire   magazine from his Glock .  pistol.  As Williams spoke, a photograph of the Rev. Clementa Pinckney was shown on the screen. The pastor, who had offered Roof a seat next to him at Bible study, was wearing a crisp white shirt and new suit now stained by blood from the five bullet wounds in his neck, back and arm. Roof’s grandmother, sitting in the courtroom while the image was displayed, wiped a tear from her eye.      Read the victims’ stories View Graphic     Read the victims’ stories  Judge Richard M. Gergel dismissed the jury for the holidays and told them to return on Jan. 3, when they will hear prosecution and defense arguments about whether Roof should be executed or sentenced to life in prison without parole. Roof also faces a separate state murder trial in January, which also carries a potential death penalty. Many friends and relatives of the dead attended the trial, in the historic heart of the city where the Civil War began, and many sat with their eyes closed tight as they listened to the verdict. “There’s no win in this. We still have grieving families, a grieving community. There’s some closure, but there’s no win in this thing,” said Kevin Singleton, 43, whose mother, Myra Thompson, was killed. “We just want to move forward and put this behind us and try to get on with our lives. Nothing good came out of any of this. ”  But some allowed themselves a moment of gratitude.  The Rev. Sharon Risher, whose mother, Ethel Lance, was among the dead, said she was “overjoyed that this part is done. ”  At the moment the verdict was read, she said, the family members “looked at each other with smiles, like, ‘Hallelujah, God is still in the   business.’ ”   Roof’s guilt in the killings was essentially uncontested; prosecutors showed the jury Roof’s interview with FBI agents in which he calmly confessed to the killings and complained that he was “worn out” after pumping more than 60 bullets into his victims.      Prosectors introduced and played Dylann Roof’s   video confession during the third day of Roof’s federal death penalty trial. (U. S. District Court for the District of South Carolina)   Under federal law, he was charged with hate crimes resulting in death, obstruction of religion and firearms violations. He was also charged with attempting to commit those same offenses against two adults and a child who survived.  His attorney, David Bruck, a death penalty specialist, told the jury he expected them to find Roof guilty, but he repeatedly tried to inject the notion that Roof was mentally or emotionally unstable. He was consistently cut off by Gergel, who said that was relevant only in the penalty phase of the trial. Roof has said he will represent himself during that phase, and Bruck was apparently trying to help his client in advance of that by giving the jury some justification to spare his life. “Consider the mad energy, the rationale, the senselessness,” Bruck said as the prosecution mounted objection after objection. “The fact that one is a racist does not tell you what else is going on. And what else is going on is what you should be thinking about. ”  The federal death penalty is rarely imposed; the last time was more than a decade ago. Roof had offered to plead guilty and accept life in prison, but the U. S. Justice Department determined that the circumstances were so egregious that they warranted seeking Roof’s execution.   The crime stood as a new and hideous chapter in the long history of racial killings in America. Prosecutors read lines from a journal found in Roof’s car and the manifesto he posted online, and they told jurors that Roof wanted to incite a race war.  Prosecutors presented evidence that Roof chose the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church, a historic monument known as Mother Emanuel, because of its spiritual and symbolic importance to the black community.  Roof told FBI interrogators that he “had to” kill blacks because they rape white women; computer records showed that he had researched “black on white” crime and spent time on white supremacist sites. He said he chose Mother Emanuel because it was the South’s oldest black church and he “knew that would be a place to get a small amount of black people in one area. ” During the trial, prosecutors documented Roof’s meticulous planning in the seven months leading up to the killings. Data collected from his GPS showed that he had made at least six trips to Charleston, visiting historic plantations and studying the church. He videotaped himself on several occasions taking target practice with his Glock in the back yard of his home. Photos showing Roof posing with the Confederate battle flag prompted South Carolina officials to remove the flag from the state capitol in Columbia.            From Roof’s Web site  "

"," NEW YORK  —   In what some are calling the “Trump rally,” investors are pushing U. S. stock markets to new heights in anticipation that the   will work with the   Congress to lower taxes and pass more   policies. In the five weeks since Donald Trump’s surprise win, traders have rushed into the market, accelerating gains that had been building all year. Their enthusiasm had the Dow Jones industrial average flirting with a   20, 000 mark that once would have seemed unattainable in 2016. For now, many are willing to look past potential stumbling blocks that lie ahead for the U. S. economy. The Federal Reserve  for instance, is beginning to raise interest rates —  it bumped up a key lending rate Wednesday, a move that traditionally has added costs for businesses —  and the global economy is bracing for Britain’s pending departure from the European Union.  There’s also the risk that Trump himself could disrupt global trade with protectionist policies, perhaps stirring a backlash from China. Investors have already learned to beware of Trump’s Twitter account: The   sent shares in Lockheed Martin, and the rest of the defense industry, tumbling after lashing out at the cost of the company’s   fighter jet earlier this week. Boeing, too, has felt his wrath and a pharmaceutical industry that once looked forward to less red tape reeled when the   vowed to bring down drug prices. Even before Trump’s election, some market analysts were warning that stock prices were too high given recent corporate financial results.   Specialist trader Mario Picone wears a ”DOW Almost 20, 000” cap as he works at his post on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday. (Brendan  )  “A pullback in this market would certainly be healthy. Trees don’t grow to the sky,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Securities.  Trump, too, spent much of his presidential campaign raising caution about the rising U. S. stock market, calling it a “big, fat, ugly bubble” and warning that investors would soon be “wiped out. ” (His spokesman said he sold his entire portfolio in June). And yet, as shares have pushed even higher, Trump‘s supporters have embraced the rally as a referendum on his   policies, creating ever higher expectations for quick results once he assumes office. Just Thursday, the National Association of Home Builders reported that U. S. builders’ confidence jumped to the highest level in more than a decade. “This notable rise in builder sentiment is largely attributable to a   bounce, as builders are hopeful that   Trump will follow through on his pledge to cut burdensome regulations that are harming small businesses and housing affordability,” Ed Brady, chairman of the trade group, said in a statement. The Dow, an index of 30 large publicly owned companies, has long been viewed as a proxy for the broader market, but its movements can be affected by big swings in individual stocks. About 20 percent of the Dow’s rise over the last month is due to one company that market analysts say could benefit greatly from Trump’s policies: Goldman Sachs.  The Wall Street giant’s stock has soared amid expectations that his administration will roll back regulations put in place to rein in the banking sector after the 2008 financial crisis. It hasn’t hurt that Trump picked Goldman veterans to lead the Treasury Department and chair his team of economic advisors. Goldman Sachs has not been the only beneficiary. Virtually every other sector of the market has also felt a lift in recent weeks. Investors are enjoying the ride. Many traders have talked openly about holding onto their shares this year in hopes the taxes they pay on gains could be lower next year. Institutional investors and other big traders, meanwhile, have shifted money out of bonds, a traditional safehaven during economic turbulence, to snap up more stock and ride the momentum. The combined market value of the 500 companies tracked by the Standard & Poors 500 has climbed nearly $1 trillion since Trump was elected.     “It is the difference between investing for a   economy and investing for strong growth,” said Jeff Carbone, a managing partner for Cornerstone Financial Partners. In nearing the 20, 000 threshold, the Dow has staged an improbable recovery in a year that started with massive selloffs as economists worried about China’s rocky economy and falling oil prices, and then panicked when Britain voted to leave the European Union. Now, investors who began the year hoping to just break even are experiencing one of their most profitable periods in years.  “The world doesn’t change when the Dow hits 20, 000. That is simply a psychological barrier,” said David Schiegoliet, a managing director at U. S. Bank. But “it can’t be ignored because market psychology can be self fulfilling. It could generate enthusiasm that will turn markets even higher. ” Much of that enthusiasm appears tied to expectations that Trump will usher in a period of deregulation and lower taxes. Trump has also, for example, that said he would lower the corporate tax rate and encourage companies that currently hold more than $2 trillion in profits overseas, where it can’t be taxed by the Internal Revenue Service, to bring that money back to the United States. Those companies may try to use some of the cash they bring back to pay dividends for shareholders or to buy back their stock, reducing the supply and pushing up the prices for the shares that remain, market analysts said. Lower corporate taxes could also help revive the market for companies wishing to go public, which has languished in recent years, market analysts say. Only about 105 companies are expected to go public by the end of the year, half as many as would occur during a typical year, according to Renaissance Capital, a manager of funds focused on initial public offerings. “Everything we see now says that 2017 should be a very strong year for IPOs,” said Kathleen Smith, a principal at Renaissance Capital.  But there are also warning signs. Twenty years ago, Nobel laureate economist Robert Shiller developed a system for determining whether stocks may be overvalued by comparing the stock price of companies listed on the S&P with corporate profits over a   period. A high ratio indicates that stocks may be too expensive, the theory goes. That ratio climbed to 27. 9 last week  a relatively high level.  But even for Shiller, Trump complicates the picture. When the ratio is “high like it is now, it suggests that returns will be weak,” he said. But Trump “is a unique political figure and it is difficult to measure his affect on the market. ” “Trump seems to have some powers of persuasion, inspiration that have propelled the economy since he was elected,” Shiller said. “In the long term it might not work out as well, but at least in the short run” it is propelling stocks forward.  Even some Trump enthusiasts are beginning to worry the recent market exuberance may be overblown. Billionaire investor Carl Icahn was one of Trump’s earliest and most vocal Wall Street supporters and when stocks initially tumbled upon his election, Icahn left the Republicans’ victory party to snap up about $1 billion in stock, later lamenting that he hadn’t bought more. But now, Icahn told CNN, “it’s gone too far. ”  “I personally think it’s a little overdone,” Icahn said of the stock market’s rise.                                          "

"," Conservative television commentator Larry Kudlow is a leading candidate to become chair   Donald Trump’s Council of Economic Advisers, which is usually run by one of the nation’s most prestigious economists.  Stephen Moore, chief economist at the Heritage Foundation and an adviser to Trump, told a Lansing, Mich. business group Thursday that Kudlow would be named to the post, though Moore later added the nomination “isn’t a done deal,” according to the Detroit News. A person close to the transition told The Post that Trump is trying to find a space for Kudlow, a Trump friend and loyal adviser during the campaign, in an economic advisory role.  If selected, Kudlow would mark another un or tho dox pick for Trump. Under both Republican and Democratic presidents, the council has provided expert economic advice to the president and attracts a staff of   young economists. But Kudlow lacks a graduate or undergraduate degree in economics and has not written scholarly papers on the subject.  A fervent supporter of deep tax cuts, Kudlow is a senior contributor at CNBC and former host of the cable channel’s primetime “The Kudlow Report. ” While continuing with his broadcasts, he informally advised Trump during the campaign. Like Moore, Kudlow disagrees with Trump about trade and opposes protectionism, but shares the  ’s desire to slash tax rates for businesses.  “He should have hammered much harder on his tax cuts,” Kudlow said of Trump’s performance in one of the debates with Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. “It’s been the Kudlow theory of debates for a long time that no matter what you are asked you give the answer you want to give on the subject you want. Trump needs to learn more about that. ”     Tracking how many key positions Trump has filled so far View Graphic     Tracking how many key positions Trump has filled so far  A graduate of the University of Rochester, where he joined the left wing Students for a Democratic Society and majored in history, Kudlow worked as a junior economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, then as chief economist first at Paine Webber and later at Bear Stearns.  He became associate director for economics and planning in the Office of Management and Budget under President Reagan. A star in the conservative fermament, Kudlow later advised Jack Kemp and toyed with the idea of running for the Senate.  But his career was derailed two decades ago by alcohol and drug addiction, and he took a long leave of absence starting in late 1992 to attend a   program to help addicts.  In recent years, he has become a popular figure on television, but his record as an economic forecaster is full of potholes.  Less than nine months before the economic crisis hit in 2008, Kudlow wrote in the National Review that “There’s no recession coming. The pessimistas were wrong. It’s not going to happen. At a bare minimum, we are looking at Goldilocks 2. 0. (And that’s a minimum). Goldilocks is alive and well. The Bush boom is alive and well. .. Yes, it’s still the greatest story never told. ”   Earlier, in 2005, he made fun of people worried about inflated housing prices, calling them “bubbleheads. ”      Here are the people whose names have been floated for Trump’s Cabinet View Graphic     Here are the people whose names have been floated for Trump’s Cabinet  John Glidden Jr. a friend of Kudlow’s since middle school, said that “Larry, most of his life, was a very   individual, very bright. ” He added that Kudlow “always wanted to be involved, always wanted to be in the right circles. ” In high school at the Englewood School for Boys in New Jersey, Glidden and Kudlow were friends and rivals. Glidden described Kudlow as a civil but “dogged” partner in speech and debate, who could argue liberal and conservative cases with equal cogency. In their senior year, the two played a match for the top slot on the school’s tennis team. Kudlow won.  Both boys’ fathers were prominent Republicans in Englewood, successful men who expected success from their sons as well.  “I’m the same way,” said Glidden, now a senior vice president at Gates Capital and the mayor of the borough of Closter, N. J. “It’s something we had in common. I think it’s something that was instilled in us, the way we were both brought up. ”  In the   and   atmosphere of Wall Street, Glidden suggested, Kudlow’s desire to be in the middle of action might have led him into addiction.  Yet Glidden said his friend has been sober for about two decades and that his experience in finance would make up for his lack of economic training. “He licked it. I’m proud of him,” he said. “He’s going to do a good job. He’s the right guy at the right time. ”  Kudlow has linked the economy’s performance to moral values, and he has blamed inequality on poor broken families.  “If we stick with what I call first principles, which is morality and ethics, some spiritual guideline which was present at the creation with the founders . . . then this country is unstoppable,” Kudlow wrote in a 1998 book title “American Abundance: The New Economic and Moral Prosperity. “We are the city on the hill. ” Some economists were shocked by the possibility of Kudlow’s appointment, news of which came the same day Obama’s Council of Economic advisers issued its annual report. Created by the Employment Act of 1946, the council last year marked its 70th anniversary, noting its “distinctive role” in “applying economic theory and empirical research to the   situations in which policymakers find themselves. ”  The past chairs have included Harvard professor Martin Feldstein, who served under Reagan; Columbia business school dean Glenn Hubbard, who served under President George W. Bush; University of California, Berkeley professor Christina D. Romer, and later Federal Reserve chiefs Benjamin S. Bernanke, Janet Yellen and Alan Greenspan.  Kudlow, by comparison, has not done any comparable research, though he is much more famous by dint of his television career.  William D. Nordhaus, a Yale economic professor and a member of President Carter’s Council of Economic Advisers, said “since   Trump apparently doesn’t listen to the professionals at intelligence agencies, why should he listen to professional economists?”     "

"," Craig Sager, a television sportscaster whose outlandish outfits, decades interviewing the biggest names in basketball and public fight with cancer made him a beloved personality in the National Basketball Association, has died, within days of his induction into the Sports Broadcasting Hall of Fame on Dec. 13. He was 65.  His death was announced by Turner Sports, where he worked as a broadcaster. Other details, including the date and place of his death, were not immediately available. Mr. Sager, who covered NBA games for TNT for 26 years, was diagnosed in 2014 with acute myeloid leukemia. He missed 11 months while undergoing treatment, and his absence from the cable network turned the already popular figure into a sympathetic and inspiring one. In an April 2016 cover story, Sports Illustrated called Mr. Sager “perhaps the most revered figure in the league. ” Known mostly for his work on the NBA sidelines, Mr. Sager also traveled the world to cover the Olympics, World Cup soccer, the NCAA men’s basketball tournament, the Super Bowl and the World Series, among other sporting events.

As he interviewed Aaron and family members on the field, Mr. Sager wrote at BleacherReport. com, “The TV people were yelling at me to get out of the shot because when they cut to Hank, I was right there with him. ” He remained conspicuous after that, not the least for his deliberately awful choice in clothing. Mr. Sager understood his role was to entertain, and what he called his “lively” wardrobe served that purpose. He wore loud ties and louder jackets. He was often the target of teasing from players and coaches, who compared him, in no particular order, to a pimp, a Christmas ornament and an ice cream man. He rarely, if ever, wore the same outfit twice. He said a reporter once counted the sport coats in his house and stopped at 137 without even checking all of his closets. For big events, Mr. Sager picked out especially wild ensembles  —   the suit he wore for the Sports Illustrated cover was a vivid turquoise. “Sports are supposed to be fun, and so I have fun with the way I dress,” Mr. Sager told BleacherReport. com. “I used to get reprimanded, but then at the 2002   Game, Commissioner [David] Stern was making fun of me, and then his wife says, ‘David, stop that.

142267,217685,A ‘power grab’? There’s some serious political drama in North Carolina right now.,Washington Post,Amber Phillips,2016-12-15,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161216005217/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/12/15/a-coup-a-power-grab-theres-some-serious-political-drama-in-north-carolina-right-now/
","         This post has been updated with the latest news. Democrats won the fight for North Carolina’s governor’s mansion this fall  —   but they’re now in a knockdown,   brawl with the   legislature about who actually gets to pull the levers of power. In the waning hours of their hold on North Carolina’s executive branch, Republicans this week unveiled and quickly pushed through bills that would significantly curb Gov.  Roy Cooper’s (D) power. Republicans held a   special session Thursday and moved bills that would, among other things, require the governor’s Cabinet appointments to be approved by the state Senate and effectively give Republicans control of the Board of Elections during election years. Other bills appeared to limit Democrats’ influence in the courts, like making North Carolina just one of several states that holds partisan elections for its state Supreme Court justices. Beleaguered Gov. Pat McCrory (R) is still in charge for a few more weeks and could sign the bills into law on his way out the door, though he hasn’t said whether he will. Which means all Democrats can do is watch. “American democracy may be more fragile than we realized,” warned longtime U. S. Rep. David Price ( . C.) in a statement. Cooper held a press conference Thursday where he described legislature’s efforts as “unprecedented” and urged them to “go home. ” “This is about thwarting the governor’s ability to move us forward,” he said, later adding: “Most people might think that this is a partisan power grab. But this is more ominous. ” What Democrats call a concerted power grab, Republicans frame as a constitutional check and balance. House Rules Chairman David Lewis (R) told local reporters the legislature wants to “establish that we are going to continue to be a relevant party in governing this state. ” Yes, he allowed, the fact they’ll have a Democratic governor next year is speeding things along. But Republican leaders maintain these reforms were long overdue. Adding to Democrats’ dismay is the fact many were caught by surprise. At the request of McCrory, GOP legislative leaders convened a special session this week to approve $200 million of disaster recovery aid for Hurricane Matthew and wildfires. There had been rumors for weeks Republicans would use the time to pack the state Supreme Court with GOP appointees, but that never came to fruition. But as the special session for hurricane relief aid was coming to a close Wednesday, GOP lawmakers suddenly convened another immediately on top of it. They wouldn’t say what it was for until the bills that would curtail Cooper’s power dropped. Urged on by Democratic lawmakers, several hundred people packed the capitol in Raleigh on Thursday to express their concern that hurricane relief was being used as a sham to play politics. Things got particularly ugly during a NAACP press conference, when one of the group’s attorneys spotted the director of the state Republican Party in the crowd and welcomed him by saying: “I know this is the first meeting he’s been in in the last two or three days that wasn’t composed of all white people. ” Democrats are having some déjà vu. The last time GOP lawmakers called a   special session, in March, they ended up ramming through one of the state’s most controversial laws in recent memory, a bill limiting what public bathrooms transgender people can use and municipalities’ ability to pass   laws for LGBT people. A national backlash to that bill helped contribute to McCrory’s upset. (He conceded earlier this month, but not before controversially calling the election into question by attempting to claim widespread voter fraud.) The state legislature is indeed acting within its rights, said UNC constitutional law professor Michael Gerhardt. But he said it is potentially concerning that lawmakers are powering through these changes such a blatantly political way: A Republican legislature is convening a special session to pass bills that limit an incoming Democratic governor’s power. What’s happening now doesn’t bode well for relations between the two branches, relations that were already expected to be contentious. Cooper ousted McCrory by some 10, 000 votes out of more than 4 million cast, and Republicans in the state legislature have a supermajority capable of vetoing Cooper anytime they want. “The concern for a lot of people is we have a legislature intent on keeping the score politically,” Gerhardt said. North Carolina’s politics could be taking its cue from Washington. President Obama’s legacy has been stymied in the courts, thanks to lawsuits brought by more than two dozen GOP state attorneys general and sometimes even Congress itself. “They look at what happened at the federal level and think ’Maybe we need to do it at the state level,” Gerhardt said. But, much like Washington, whether you think what’s happening in North Carolina is right or wrong probably depends on your politics. Gerhardt added: “If you’re a ’big D Democrat,’ [this] worries you. If you’re a ’big R Republican,’ maybe it worries you, maybe it doesn’t. ”"
142268,217686,How might Nixon’s ‘madman theory’ apply to Trump?,Washington Post,Barton Swaim,2016-12-15,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161216005217/https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2016/12/15/how-might-nixons-madman-theory-apply-to-trump/
","     In 1987, Politico reported this week, former president Richard Nixon wrote a brief letter to future president Donald Trump. “Mrs. Nixon told me that you were great on the Donahue Show,” Nixon wrote. “As you can imagine, she is an expert on politics and she predicts that whenever you decide to run for office you will be a winner!” The letter will be displayed in the Oval Office. I am not aware that Trump’s interest in Nixon extends beyond this letter, and in any case comparisons between the 45th and 37th presidents wouldn’t seem to go far beyond a couple of general tendencies: Trump’s hatred for the Washington press corps strikes one as Nixonian, and of course neither man will be remembered for ideological consistency. The two men’s styles may converge at one significant point, however, on the matter of foreign relations. Like Trump, Nixon was concerned to keep his adversaries guessing about his motives and temperament. Nixon never wanted the Soviets to feel confident that they knew what he would do, or that he wouldn’t do something outrageous or irrational. His famous term for this tactic, recalled by H. R. Haldeman in his posthumously published diary, was the “madman theory. ” Nixon wanted the North Vietnamese, with whom the United States was negotiating a peace agreement, to feel a sense of apprehension about what the president might do if pushed to the brink. Recalled Haldeman: We were walking along a foggy beach after a long day of speechwriting. He said, “I call it the Madman Theory, Bob. I want the North Vietnamese to believe I’ve reached the point where I might do anything to stop the war. We’ll just slip the word to them that, for God’s sake, you know Nixon is obsessed about Communism. We can’t restrain him when he’s angry  —   and he has his hand on the nuclear button  —   and Ho Chi Minh himself will be in Paris in two days begging for peace. ” And Nixon did more than “just slip the word. ” In October 1969 he dramatically raised the Strategic Air Command’s readiness level and made a nuclear strike look imminent, evidently in an attempt to rattle Ho’s Soviet backers. Melvin Laird, Nixon’s secretary of defense, later observed that this was done to make the Russians think “you could never put your finger on what he [Nixon] might do next. ” Put to one side your views of Nixon, the Vietnam War, and the way peace terms were negotiated from 1968 to 1973. At least this much is true: In international negotiations, particularly with distrustful or belligerent counterparts, the ploy of making the other side believe you can’t be pushed too far without inviting terrible consequences  —   or at least that your   can’t be easily predicted  —   might occasionally have its uses. One of the challenges any American president has    heads of undemocratic regimes is just this, that whereas the autocrat’s motives must oftentimes be guessed at, an elected president has by definition spent months openly enunciating his views about America’s role in the world. Nixon tried to compensate for that disadvantage by hinting through intermediaries (Henry Kissinger and others) that he might be emotionally or psychologically unstable. Somehow I doubt it worked, or anyhow I doubt it worked well: Everything about Richard Nixon suggested cold calculation and calmly reasoned strategizing  —   he might get angry but he wasn’t going to start a war in a fit of rage  —   and in any case Russian diplomats would have assumed some component of duplicity in any message delivered by their American counterparts, however seemingly candid. Donald Trump is a different matter altogether. He doesn’t need to have intermediaries suggest by furtive murmurs that the boss might be a little crazy. Everybody thinks that already. It’s true, as Post columnist Dana Milbank contended recently, that Trump’s studied unpredictability may have dire consequences at home and abroad. Milbank wrote: “In Trump’s application of the Madman Theory there seems to be less theory than madman. There may be advantages to keeping foes and opponents off guard, but Trump is baffling friends and allies, too. In foreign affairs, unpredictability spooks allies and spreads instability. ” Maybe. But we’ve had many a “spooked” ally before, and oftentimes a spooked ally is still very much an ally. As for instability, we’ve had plenty of it under the highly predictable Obama administration. So put to one side your views of Trump, his character, his statements  —   and consider the possibility that he may be more calculating and deliberate than anybody gives him credit for. Nixon’s madman theory may in that case prove more effective for Trump than it ever did for Nixon. Even after hearing Trump talk about nearly everything for 18 months, no one’s sure what he’ll do or even what general approach he’ll take to foreign confrontations. If there is a foreign leader who feels he or she has got the measure of   Trump, that foreign leader is an idiot. Whether Trump uses the advantage of unpredictability for good or ill is anybody’s guess. There are grounds for thinking he may pursue a shortsighted   realpolitik, and in that case the agreements he strikes with other nations will benefit American industry and interests in the narrowest sense. But events have a way of upending presidents’ worldviews  —   George W. Bush, remember, rejected “nation building” as a presidential candidate  —   and it’s just conceivable that Trump may use his cunning to accomplish worthier goals than his myriad critics think him inclined to pursue. Trump, in other words  —   the madman, not in theory, but in practice  —   may bring off some creditable diplomatic victories precisely because foreign leaders and their emissaries don’t feel it’s in their interest to test the White House. It’s hard to imagine, for instance, President Trump’s secretary of state going cap in hand to the Iranians even after the Iranians have failed, or refused, to uphold their end of a painstakingly forged agreement. Hard, too, to imagine a Syrian regime deliberately crossing a red line just to see what President Trump will do. At this point, though, we have no idea what he’ll do. And that’s the point."

","     The scale of the conspiracy is staggering: More than 300 million of Venezuela’s   bank notes have been ferried out of the country in recent months. Huge stacks of   bills now sit in warehouses throughout Central and Eastern Europe  —   Poland, Ukraine, Switzerland, Germany, the Czech Republic, Macedonia  —   all part of a devious plot hatched by the U. S. Treasury Department. Working through local nongovernmental organizations and local mafia syndicates, the plotters have spirited the actual physical banknotes first by land to neighboring Colombia and later by air to Europe in an ambitious bid to overthrow Venezuela’s socialist government by choking off the supply of paper money, setting off chaos and destabilizing the economy. The notes can’t be destroyed because the Americans have offered to pay dollars for them to their proxies, but only once the government has actually been overthrown. If this story sounds outlandish to you, spare a thought for the people of Venezuela, who sat stunned on Tuesday as the powerful interior minister, Nestor Reverol, announced this bizarre, baseless conspiracy theory as settled fact. Reverol’s reverie was far from innocent. PowerPoint presentation in hand, he set out his story to justify the government’s cunning plan to   the threat by removing the   bill from circulation altogether, within 72 hours. The announcement set off panic, as millions of people scrambled to round up their   bills and deposit them in bank accounts ahead of the arbitrary deadline. Everyday life  —   already disastrously precarious for many  —   was thrown into complete disarray as everyone from bus drivers to shop owners refused to accept the bills, realizing that there’s no point accumulating banknotes that will be worth nothing by the end of the week. As a result, Venezuela’s economy, which was already one of the most dysfunctional in the world, virtually stopped altogether this week. The   bill, lest we forget, was only worth about 3 U. S. cents to begin with. Withdrawing it leaves the country relying on the   bill  —   now worth a penny and a half  —   as the biggest bill, at least until new   bills come into circulation. That was supposed to happen in the next few days. Surprise, surprise: The 500s are late. Reverol’s story is so   so plain weird, it’s easy to lose sight of the fact that it doesn’t make the least bit of sense in its own fantastical terms. If the “international mafias” that haunt the minister’s imagination really were stockpiling   bills purely to sell them to the United States following regime collapse, why would they possibly care if they’re legal tender in Venezuela? The minister clearly has not thought his own conspiracy theory through. He’s proposing to fight a secret plan to withdraw money from the country in order to cause economic chaos by   …     withdrawing much more paper money from circulation and creating far more chaos, especially among the poor, who often don’t have bank accounts in which to deposit their banknotes in the first place. In fairness, though, it’s probably unwise to spend too much time and effort puzzling through the official story. It is so harebrained that Reverol can’t possibly believe it. Other government officials, including President Nicolás Maduro, have portrayed the decision as aimed more at illegal exchange bureaus along the Colombian border, which the government is convinced are manipulating the value of the bolivar. This makes more sense than the tall tales about Macedonian warehouses, but not that much more. To believe it, you’d have to think businessmen in Colombia are choosing to hoard one of the world’s   assets. This version of the conspiracy theory refutes itself just as readily as the other one. With the bolivar losing 10 percent to 20 percent of its value every single month, stockpiling Venezuelan banknotes would be a little like trying to stockpile ice in open air in Phoenix in the summer. So why is the government doing this, really? It’s a question Venezuelan economists have been asking themselves privately all week. Perhaps the measure is aimed at one specific player, some enemy Maduro happens to know is sitting on a lot of   bills specifically this week. Maybe. Or maybe the Maduro administration has just lost the capacity for making even the most minimally logical of economic decisions for the country. Maybe we’ve entered the   stage of the revolution, where everyone with even a passing acquaintance with the way a modern economy works has already been purged from the ranks and major policy decisions are made almost randomly, by a leadership clique that isn’t able even to measure the harm those decisions will do not only to the country at large but also to their own political  . Maybe. It isn’t easy to tell at this point. Which is alarming in itself."
142270,217688,The GOP strategy to ‘repeal and replace’ Obamacare is a joke,Washington Post,Greg Sargent,2016-12-15,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161216005217/https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2016/12/15/the-gop-strategy-to-repeal-and-replace-obamacare-is-a-joke/
","     THE MORNING PLUM: Politico’s lead headline today blares: “Democrats open to replacing Obamacare. ” The story accompanying that headline is more nuanced than that. But it does raise the prospect that some Senate Democrats might be going wobbly about the coming battle over repeal and replace. And it points out that Dems might find themselves under pressure to acquiesce to Republicans in ways that would produce a terrible outcome. But the story is at least as revealing in another way: It demonstrates key weaknesses that Republicans face in the coming battle, ones that Democrats can exploit  —   if they handle this correctly. Here’s the crux of it: Senate Democrats will never vote to repeal Obamacare. But once the deed is done, a surprising number of them say they’re open to helping Republicans replace it. “If it makes sense, I think there’ll be a lot of Democrats who would be for it,” said Sen. Claire McCaskill ( . ). As Republicans aim to make good on their   vow to quash Obamacare and replace it with their own health care vision, they’ll have to do something Democrats were never able to: Bring members of the opposing party on board. Enacting any substantive alternative will take at least eight Democratic votes in the Senate. Yet the GOP will have powerful leverage that Democrats lacked in 2009  —   namely, a huge number of members facing reelection in hostile territory.   Democrats are on the ballot in 2018, including 10 in states that Donald Trump just won. The GOP is betting that many or most in the latter group will be under irresistible pressure to back an Obamacare replacement, if the alternative is leaving millions of people in the lurch without insurance. The GOP game plan is to repeal much of the law via a simple majority “reconciliation” process, killing the Medicaid expansion and the subsidies that have expanded coverage to many millions. Republicans would implement a delay in repeal kicking in, so they can develop a replacement that  —   because it would be much more in keeping with GOP health reform ideas  —   would end up covering far fewer people.      Donald Trump has campaigned to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, otherwise known as Obamacare, once he gets into office. Now that he’s won the presidency with a majority Republican House and Senate, that feat might not prove to be too easy. Wonkblog’s Max Ehrenfreund explains. (Daron   Washington Post)   At this point, goes the theory, Democrats facing reelection in 2018 would be under pressure to join Republicans in backing this replacement, because it would at least cover some people. Result: Obamacare is repealed; GOP replace goes into effect; far fewer people are covered, but Republicans can say they did reform the health system and helped people. The story quotes a few Democrats saying they might be open to backing some kind of replacement in this scenario. But there are problems with this plan. Some Republicans want to delay repeal to push the fallout (millions losing health insurance) until after the 2018 midterm elections, while using the specter of that fallout as a leverage point in the   to those elections to force Dems into cooperating to bail all those people out with a GOP replacement. But to do this, Republicans would have to be offering a plan that actually bails all those people out with a GOP replacement. Only then could they blast Democrats for failing to join them in helping bail out all those people. Most experts expect Republicans to offer a replacement plan that would cover far fewer people. If so, at that point, Republicans would still be in the position of rolling back the health coverage of millions  —   those who benefited from Obamacare, but won’t regain coverage under the GOP replacement  —   even if the GOP replacement were to pass. With that looming, that’s the point at which Democrats can position themselves as the ones who are arguing for actually bailing out those people, by saying that they will only support a more generous replacement plan that covers a lot more people than the GOP replacement would.      Speaking to The Washington Post Tuesday, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy said that it will be a lot easier to repeal Obamacare than replace it, due to Senate procedure. ”Repealing it easier and faster because that could be a 51 vote,” McCarthy said. ”Replacing is going to be 60 votes.” Asked when Congress would begin the process of repealing or replacing the law, McCarthy said he doesn’t want to put a time limit to get it done by a certain date. ”I want to make sure it gets done right,” he said. ”You need to make sure you replace it properly.” (Washington Post Live)   At this point, the Republican argument would devolve into absurdity. Are Republicans really going to blast Democrats for refusing to cooperate in covering people, after they have already voted to repeal coverage for all of Obamacare’s beneficiaries, and even as they are insisting on a replacement that covers far fewer people than the Democrats want to cover? No question, Republicans are highly skilled at covering up their policy gibberish with all manner of obfuscation, but good luck messaging that one. What’s more, if Republicans do repeal much of the ACA through reconciliation  —   and they are almost certain to succeed at that  —   the fallout from this vote may well begin immediately. As others have already pointed out, insurers might exit the exchanges rather than stick around and wait for a replacement that might never materialize. And, if Republicans keep the ban on discrimination against preexisting conditions while repealing the mandate, that could wreak havoc on the insurance markets. The ensuing mess could shift the political calculus in the near term, putting more pressure on Republicans to do something to replace the ACA, which in turn (since a number of congressional conservatives won’t support any replacement) would require Democratic cooperation. Dems could theoretically leverage that for a much better replacement. To be sure, for Democrats to play this right, they need to hold to a hard, unified line against any   GOP replace plan. Chuck Schumer has vowed to me that Democrats will do that. But we don’t know for sure if they will. Right now, Democrats probably should be laying down a marker, making it clear that the only replacement they’ll accept is one that does not substantially roll back the coverage expansion achieved by Obamacare. To be sure, one very possible outcome is that the ACA is mostly repealed and falls apart, and no replacement ever passes, either because Republicans cannot reach consensus on any replace plan, or because Democrats end up refusing to support the one they do create. Many Republicans would be quietly fine with this outcome, and surely some conservatives would celebrate it. But it wouldn’t be “repeal and replace. ” It would just be “repeal. ” More than 20 million would lose coverage, a huge mess would ensue, and we’d battle all this out again heading into the 2020 elections. ************************************************************* * PUTIN WAS DIRECTLY INVOLVED, OFFICIALS SAY: NBC News reports that U. S. officials have concluded Vladimir Putin was directly involved in efforts to swing the election: Two senior officials with direct access to the information say new intelligence shows that Putin personally directed how hacked material from Democrats was leaked and otherwise used. The intelligence came from diplomatic sources and spies working for U. S. allies, the officials said. The U. S has solid information tying Putin to the operation, the intelligence officials say. If more news like this keeps coming, it could increase the pressure on congressional Republicans to allow a genuinely bipartisan, independent investigation into what happened. * OIL AND GAS INDUSTRY IS AMASSING POWER: The Post has a nicely reported piece documenting how the fossil fuel industry is poised for a major comeback in Trump’s Washington: The oil, gas and coal industries are amassing power throughout Washington  —   from Foggy Bottom, where ExxonMobil chief executive Rex Tillerson is Trump’s nominee to be secretary of state, to domestic regulatory agencies including the departments of Energy and Interior as well as the Environmental Protection Agency.   …     A slew of Obama administration policies on fossil fuels are expected to be reversed after Trump is sworn into office on Jan. 20. This will do wonders to drain the swamp and trigger a massive revival of coal mining jobs. * AMERICANS DIVIDED ON TRUMP’S CABINET PICKS: A new CBS News poll finds that Trump’s Cabinet choices are meeting far less public approval than those of his predecessors did:   percent approve of the choices Donald Trump has made for his cabinet so far, while another 41 percent disapprove.  Reaction to Mr. Trump’s cabinet appointees is far more negative than his two immediate predecessors:  seven in 10 Americans approved of the cabinet appointments of Barack Obama, and six in 10 approved of those appointed by George W. Bush. But Trump won by a “landslide” and his mandate is huge, tremendous and wonderful. * AMERICANS SKEPTICAL OF TRUMP’S PLANS FOR HIS BUSINESS: The CBS poll also finds that a large majority of Americans do not think putting his sons in charge of his businesses will prevent conflicts of interest later: While a quarter of Americans think doing so will prevent Mr. Trump from having conflicts of interest, seven in 10 do not.  More than four in 10 Republicans agree with large majorities of Democrats (90 percent) and independents (73 percent) that this may not be adequate to prevent conflicts of interest while he serves as president. The poll does find that 50 percent say Trump is likely to act in America’s interests, and not those of his business empire, so he may get cut a bit of slack. But not much  —   and that’s the key. * REPUBLICANS PRESSURE TRUMP NOT TO PICK BOLTON: The Times reports that top Republicans don’t want Trump to pick John Bolton as deputy secretary of state, because he’s “combative and strident” and aligned with the Dick Cheney hawks in the party: Senator Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee, chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, has said privately that he has misgivings   …     Mr. Bolton   …     is also facing stiff resistance from some of the Republican Party’s   leaders in world affairs   …     They include Condoleezza Rice, the former secretary of state and national security adviser, who clashed with Mr. Cheney. It’s also amusing that Trump, who duped people into seeing him as “ ” by blasting the Iraq War as the height of folly during the campaign, might install one of its most vocal advocates. * DON’T EXPECT AN ELECTORAL COLLEGE REVOLT: The Associated Press talks to hundreds of electors and concludes there’s no way it will happen: Scores of the Republicans chosen to cast votes in the   meetings told AP they feel bound by history, duty, party loyalty or the law to   their state’s results and make him president. Appeals numbering in the tens of thousands  —   drowning inboxes, ringing cell phones, stuffing home and office mailboxes with actual handwritten letters  —   have not swayed them. The article also details the outpouring of angst from people across the country who have been lobbying them  —   a window into just how much dread there is out there about President Trump. * AND THE QUOTE OF THE DAY,    EDITION: Sean Spicer, a spokesman for the Republican National Committee, actually defended Trump’s evolving    this way: “You tell everyone, here’s what’s going on, here’s the process, here are the people that are playing a role, that’s being transparent. Conflicts of interest arise when you’re not  —   when you’re sneaky about it, when you’re shady about it, when you’re not transparent about it. ” Yeah, that’s the ticket. Conflicts of interest only exist if you’re being “sneaky” instead of “transparent. ” Come to think of it, doesn’t this mean Trump should release his tax returns?

","     Democrats in Congress, upset by the Trump transition team’s efforts to identify Energy Department officials who worked on climate change, are trying to head off a larger effort to identify and potentially purge bureaucrats who worked on Obama administration policies at the State Department. The Obama administration’s political appointees will leave office en masse when   Donald Trump takes office, but the civil servants and career diplomats who worked with them will largely remain. The fear is that the Trump team will try to single out career officials who have worked on several Obama foreign policy items that they may seek to reverse, such as the Iran nuclear agreement and the Paris climate accords. Earlier this week, the Energy Department refused a request by the Trump transition team to identify specific officials and contractors who have worked on climate change. On Wednesday, the Trump transition team said that this request had not been officially authorized. On Thursday, all but one of the Democrats on the House Foreign Affairs Committee wrote to Secretary of State John Kerry to urge him to reject any similar requests that his agency might get from the incoming administration. “We believe your Department should work to ensure a smooth transition of power,” said the letter, led by ranking Democrat Eliot L. Engel (N. Y.). “However, individual civil servants, Foreign Service Officers, and other staff should not be singled out for their work in support of policy objectives that clash with the next Administration’s goals, leaving them vulnerable to retribution by the incoming Administration. ” The House Foreign Affairs Committee Democrats are setting up a portal on their website enabling State Department and USAID whistleblowers to alert them of any unethical or illegal practices, including but not limited to efforts to single out federal employees who may not agree with the Trump agenda. “In our view, gathering names in this manner bears striking resemblance to dark chapters in our history marked by enemies lists and political witch hunts,” 18 of the 19 committee Democrats said. “We want to make sure that you and the Department of State know that you have our full support as you seek to protect the Department’s public servants. ” The only committee Democrat not to sign the letter was Rep. Tulsi Gabbard ( ) who met with the   at Trump Tower last month. There’s no indication that the Trump team has asked the State Department to single out officials or contractors connected to any particular policy, committee sources told me. But Democrats were taken aback by the Energy Department request and want to prepare for a wider purge effort. A senior State Department official told me that Kerry had received the letter and was preparing a formal reply. “We would, of course, not comply with such a request for names,” the official said. The Trump transition team did not reply to a request for comment. Fears of a purge of career officials also extend to the Defense Department and the intelligence community, in light of Trump’s public attack on the CIA after it assessed that the Russian government intervened in the U. S. election to aid his candidacy. There are also concerns that Trump’s incoming national security adviser, retired Lt. Gen. Mike Flynn, could seek to replace top defense and national security officials. Before being ousted as director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, he clashed with other officials and analysts over what he saw as an effort to oversell successes and downplay setbacks in the war on Islamic terrorism. As president, Trump is entitled to install a team of senior officials to run national security agencies who will advance his foreign policy goals. The professionals working in those agencies will be obligated to help them. But they should not be punished for helping the Obama team that they were also   to assist."
142272,217690,When does democracy fail? When voters don’t get what they asked for.,Washington Post,Mark Blyth,2016-12-15,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161216005217/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/in-theory/wp/2016/12/15/when-does-democracy-fail-when-voters-dont-get-what-they-asked-for/
","     Mark Blyth is Eastman professor of political economy at Brown University. Stable democracies, at least in rich countries, are the product of two conditions. The first is that people get what they vote for: that is, the policies they vote for are the policies they receive. The second is that even for citizens on the losing side, the outcomes for society overall are positive. If these conditions are not met  —   as is the case today, especially in Europe  —   democracy can become very fragile indeed. To get what you vote for, you must at least have the right to vote. Even in the wealthiest countries, democracy is of recent vintage  —   something that we tend to forget. The U. S. was founded as a republic, not a democracy: All of its adult citizens were not fully enfranchised until 1965. Democracy as we now know it came to Europe at the end of World War II, as the antidote to fascism and then to communism. It worked so long as two policies were pursued: First, that the investor class of a given society could not move its wealth abroad and had to invest at home to make profits, increasing the   of its countrymen.  The second was that governments prioritized full employment and wage growth. The restrictions placed on global finance after the war made the first condition hold, and governments produced policies that made everyone richer  —   primarily because capital was invested at home and workers paid taxes that gave them social insurance. In short, the people got what they voted for  —   the promise of growth that would benefit everyone. U. S. incomes doubled from 1930 to 1960 and then doubled again from 1960 to 1980. Europe had “Les Trentes Glorieuses,” and the Italians spoke of “Il Boom. ” But this changed in the 1980s. The side effect of policies pushing up employment and wages was inflation, which acted as a   tax on investment and profits. (If I invest today for a 5 percent return and inflation rises to 6 percent, I’ve lost cash.) In response, the investor classes of the developed world launched a   revolution  —   think Reagan, Thatcher and the European central bank  —   that switched policy targets from employment and wage growth to lowering inflation and stabilizing prices. They also freed finance from its “repressed” condition, globalized production and privatized the state. They promised citizens more prosperity by different but purportedly more efficient ‘market friendly’ means. But since 1980, outcomes for society overall have not been positive  —   only for the investor class. Growth in the period 1980 to 2008 was half of what it was in 1950 to 1980. And while productivity has risen and profits have soared, wages for almost everyone outside of the top 10 percent have stagnated. (After all, why should you get a pay raise if prices are stable? And be careful about asking for one: Your job might get moved abroad.) To keep the illusion of prosperity going, the financial sector has filled the wage gap with credit. Citibank was hardly alone in offering people the chance to “Live Richly” and “open a cravings account” in the   and the 90 percent has leveraged up. Meanwhile, we got so good at controlling inflation that central banks today cannot generate any of it at all no matter how hard they try, which makes it difficult to pay back debts, especially when wages are not growing.  Unsurprisingly, people are beginning to realize that they are no longer getting what they vote for. Instead, they are being asked to pay more and more for what they already receive through taxes, taken from stagnant or declining incomes, which also must service their debts. In such a world it’s great to be a creditor and lousy to be a debtor. The problem for democracy is that most people are debtors. In such a   world, however, democracy is reduced knowing that the menu of policy will never vary. Trump’s win in the Midwest, British voters deciding to leave the European Union, Italy’s referendum and Greece’s revolt against its creditors are all connected in this way. Looking forward, similar trends are playing out in France, which will hold elections next year. At the moment, the only party that wants to fundamentally break with the policies of the past 30 years is the National Front. Given the pathetic state of the French left parties, leftist voters in France are being asked to turn out to elect a   candidate who wants France to embrace more of the same liberalizing and   policies that have failed everywhere. But why would they do this? Just to stop the Front, whose economic policies are far closer to what they want? This has Brexit and Trump written all over it. At the end of the day, when you no longer get what you vote for and when the role of voting is reduced to affirming the status quo, voters will vote for the most undemocratic of options if that is all that is “off the menu. ” That’s democracy in action in a world devoid of choice. When you can’t get what you want and most people do not benefit from the economic outcomes of government, it’s also what makes democracy unstable. Read more: Has Western democracy become unstable?

142273,217691,A student asked Ken Burns what to do in Trump’s America. He gave her this advice.,Washington Post,Alyssa Rosenberg,2016-12-15,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161216005217/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/act-four/wp/2016/12/15/a-student-asked-ken-burns-what-to-do-in-trumps-america-he-gave-her-this-advice/
","         In June, after Donald Trump won enough delegates to become the Republican nominee for president, Ken Burns took the podium in Palo Alto, Calif. to deliver Stanford University’s commencement address. Though Burns’s politics are no secret to anyone who listens to him or who watches his documentaries, which explore major moments and movements in American history from “The Civil War” to “Jazz,” the strength of his attack on Trump took some national observers and graduating students by surprise. One of them, Nathalie Weiss, thought that Burns’s decision to push the graduates rather than to celebrate their accomplishments was inappropriate  —   until Election Day delivered a result she hadn’t previously thought was possible. “There was no doubt in my mind that Hillary [Clinton] was going to win, and I almost felt cocky about that,” Weiss said when I talked to her on Wednesday. “I didn’t really think that Trump or Bernie [Sanders] winning was in the cards. I didn’t really take it seriously. ” Previously, her model for a commencement address had been cartoonist Mike Peters’s speech at the 2012 graduation at  Washington University in St. Louis, “the sort of thing that had a lot of serendipity, a lot of joy and excitement, and still had a message of staying true to yourself. ” After graduation, Weiss watched a number of her classmates go to work in politics, or at least become more actively engaged than they had been in college “by nature of entering the real world, being independent, becoming a citizen, and having an election with the stakes of this one. ” And when the results she never expected came in on November 8, she wrote a letter to Burns first published in the Stanford Daily and reprinted here to explain her initial reaction to his speech and to ask what she and her peers should be doing next. Dear Mr. Burns, In light of this election and its outcome, my thoughts continue to circle back to the speech you delivered to my graduating class at Stanford this June. You probably don’t remember me  —   I’m sure you shook a lot of hands that day  —   but I thanked you outside the stadium as you prepared to leave. To be perfectly honest, however, I did not enjoy the speech. One of my largest frustrations at school was the lack of political agency amongst my friends, and I found your reminder of this vexing. Isn’t graduation a time for celebration? Couldn’t we put the world on pause and spend the weekend happily commemorating the past four years with dear friends and family? Shouldn’t our commencement speaker impart words full of optimistic wisdom derived from years of   success? Apparently not. Instead, you implored us to examine history in order to warn about the perilous consequences at stake in this election. Yet in the moment, it seemed unfit for the occasion. This ceremony, traditionally a celebration, became a platform for our speaker’s agenda. And though I agreed with your message, what I didn’t understand then, but certainly do now, is that you were holding us to a higher standard than you would have in a normal year, because this is not a normal year. You thought we would hear your message. But we were selfish. I regret not listening. Commencement as you explained is not only about reflecting on the past but also about approaching the future and life as an adult citizen. You informed us that this rite of passage comes with responsibilities that extend beyond getting a job and paying bills. During a weekend already shrouded in the heartbreak of Brock Turner’s trial sentence and the scrutiny of sexual assault culture on college campuses, you came to remind us of another threat  —   one that would define our commencement into the real world. You warned about Donald Trump and how his candidacy confronted our nation with a “ferocious urgency. ” I agreed with your message, but chose to remain passive. I chose to celebrate instead of contemplate. To talk instead of do. I allowed this election to unfold by merely voting for Secretary Clinton rather than devoting myself to her campaign. Now the polls have closed. I regret my indolence. I don’t claim that my actions alone would have reversed the results of this election, but I do believe I could have made a difference, especially if my peers had been similarly galvanized. We could have been for something, as you so ardently advised. Many were, but others, myself included, were not. I regret my complacency. The graduation body you addressed had the honor and privilege to obtain the best education this country offers. You addressed us as the future leaders of our generation with well researched sincerity and unfiltered fear. And we, as a student body, did not respond in kind. I regret my inaction. But what now? What do we do with this divided nation of ours that, just a few days ago, stated that our chosen leader will be a man with no political experience, whose rhetoric is laced with sexist, racist, homophobic and isolationist principles (among others)?  I’m offended. I’m pissed off. I’m  . I’m terrified. I’m confused. I’m still American. So, what now? What do I  —   what do we  —   do? One thing is certain: I cannot remain passive. My peers and I no longer study at Stanford nor live in its safety net, so we cannot avoid or ignore the social and economic threats a Trump presidency presents. Armed with our education, we must choose to act and ensure that the future of this country does not regress into a state of “ . ” We must embrace each other and be brave for each other. We must not forget the shock on election night nor the residual fear. We must be catalyzed to serve our country to work towards a future that is empathetic rather than polarized. We must care, vocally and actively, about each other, about the environment, about education and about so much more. We must ensure that the progressive policies fought for and accomplished over the last eight years are protected and deepened. Though in the wake of this election, we witness   hate crimes on the rise, we must recognize that we cannot match anger with anger. The individuals who voted for Mr. Trump do not deserve our hate. It’s hard. It hurts. But as we hurt, we must remember President Obama’s wise reminder: We are all on one team. This team must learn to work together as a nation to yield understanding and achieve progress. On both sides. Thank you, Mr. Burns, for speaking at Stanford’s commencement and for stripping down ceremonial gaieties in order to address the student body with candor, believing that we would not just listen but that we would act. I will not be helpless. I will not be silenced. I will not forget. I will be for our nation and its citizens. But I am still processing. Still hurting. Still learning. I did not listen then, but I implore you now  —   what do I do? With the deepest respect and gratitude,  —   Nathalie Weiss ’16 It took Burns a while to write her back. “I suddenly found myself the optimistic Frodo in Mordor,” after the election he acknowledged when we spoke on the phone. But he felt like in Weiss’s frank letter, “she fell on her sword. And so I couldn’t do anything. I found myself just cramped. I was working every day, getting a lot done. It sat on my counter  …    . I needed that few weeks to just take stock of myself, and to sort of quit shivering. ” But when he did sit down to write, he had one word in mind: “Engagement. ” “My grandmother wrote every week, every week she wrote her congressman and her senators,” Burns said of the spike in voters calling lawmakers in the wake of the election. “And I was like ‘Grandmother, do they write you back?’ She goes, ‘Always. It’s usually a form letter,’ but she wanted them to know. God bless her. And I did it. As a kid, I wrote to Jackie Kennedy after the president was killed, and I wrote to Lyndon Johnson my opposition to the war and got back three inches of speeches about why he was for the war. ” And so engage is what Burns urged Weiss to do in his letter to her, printed for the first time here: December 12, 2016 Dear Nathalie, Please forgive the amount of time it’s taken for me to respond to your heartfelt and anguished letter. I guess I too have been suffering from the unexpected turn of events, I too needed some time in the fetal position, covers pulled up to my chin, as I tried myself to come to terms with an election that seems to have undermined so much of the progress we’ve made in the last fifty years  —   on race, women’s rights, the environment, diversity and understanding our role in the world. Do not be too hard on yourself.  We are all distracted by comforting routines and habits.  It is hard to break from them to do what for many seems abstract: participating in our much maligned political process. But I hear in your anguish a call to action that ought to awaken anyone  —   including myself  —   who misread this election. We need to be thoughtful in that action. Blind, angry protest will not help; it will only strengthen those who do not share our worldview. Passivity  —   as we have both discovered  —   is also not an option. We must choose a middle ground: engagement. But the engagement we seek must understand that those people who did not vote as we did are not our enemy. In fact, true engagement is walking into the heart of that constituency, offering shared stories and real solutions rather than narratives that are calculated to divide, offering fellowship and unity, where fake news has helped stoke tribal angers. We must understand too that we have also been betrayed by the   “mainstream media,” who fawned for months over the clearly unqualified candidate, giving him billions of dollars of free media, betrayed by cynical executives more interested in a buck than the facts of the matter, and betrayed by the lazy paid pundits more interested in protecting their own “brands” than in the   of the Republic they pretend to serve. We were betrayed too by pollsters phoning in  —   literally  —   their work and by politicians who spoke to their base and did not venture from safe venues, that is to say, they stayed far away from the genuine hurt and the mistrust and the economic dead ends that afflict so many of us. We must try to point out that even with a progressive president who taxed the wealthy, the gap between the haves and   has grown; we can be assured now that this gap will only grow, not shrink. We must engage the business sector  —   corporate America will play a huge role in helping maintain our equilibrium, either by applying pressure to retrograde political forces or facing the pain of consumer boycotts. We must try to remember that this level of vulgarity, of blatant lying, of demonizing whole groups of people, nearly always backfires, that real change will come when middle class whites, Hispanics and blacks realize they share more in common with each other than those in whose interest it is that they stay divided. This has been a successful strategy for generations in this country: why not blame the other, who might take your job, rather than blame the boss who laughs all the way to the bank. What to do, you ask? A million things, of course. But it begins only with the first step of awareness and commitment, which you have already made. Just go forward. Engage. Don’t despair. Find likeminded people  —   not from your social circle, but everywhere. Change the opinions of others, not with ridicule, but reason. Finally, remember too that Barack Obama himself has said that the highest office in the land is not president, but citizen. Be one. With my sincerest best wishes, Ken Burns Prior to the Stanford address, Burns had confined his political speeches to races in his home state of New Hampshire, though in 2015, he and Henry Louis Gates Jr. kicked off a nationwide series of conversations about race in America that ran through this year. He’s looking forward to using his two upcoming documentaries, the first a deep dive on the Vietnam War due in 2017, the second, a history of country music that will air in 2019, to “remind us that we belong to the same family, that we are all relatives, and the demonization of the other is this periodic, political trick that has   effectiveness but   doesn’t really work. ” When I asked him if he’d continue to speak out nationally now that the result he had warned about had come to pass, he said he truly wasn’t sure. Even the Stanford speech was the result of Burns’s feeling in the weeks leading up to the address that warning against Trump was necessary, rather than a plan long in the making. But focusing on his work, and his general inclination to talk about politics through the lens of the stories he’s telling “doesn’t mean I’m going to sit by idly,” Burns told me. “I don’t want my country to disappear. ”      "

"," Sanctions against Iran were officially extended for another decade Thursday, even though President Obama did not sign the legislation, a symbolic move intended to show the White House’s disapproval of the bill. The sanctions renewal, which passed Congress with enough votes to be   has triggered complaints from Tehran. The Iranian government views the nuclear agreement as entailing a promise of no new sanctions. The White House, by not signing the bill, is trying to alleviate Iran’s concerns. Secretary of State John F. Kerry said the nuclear deal is still a “top strategic objective” for the United States. With or without the sanctions renewed, he said, the United States could snap sanctions back into place if Iran were to violate the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) the formal name for the nuclear deal. Kerry said that even though he considers it unnecessary to renew the existing waivers, he had done so anyway “to ensure maximum clarity” that the United States will meet its obligations under the deal. He also said he had contacted Iran’s foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, and U. S. allies to reassure them that the United States remains committed to the deal that gave Iran sanctions relief once it pared back its nuclear program.  “As long as Iran adheres to its commitments under the JCPOA, we remain steadfastly committed to maintaining ours as well,” he said.     Here’s what’s in the Iran nuclear deal, and what happens next. (Gillian Brockell and Julio C.   Washington Post)   But with   Donald Trump just five weeks away from taking office, Kerry’s guarantees may be   if the new administration takes a tougher approach to Iran, as is expected. “President Obama doesn’t want to provide an excuse in the waning days of his administration for the Iranians to walk away from the deal,” said Mark Dubowitz, head of the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies and a prominent critic of the Iran deal. “But at this point, he’s a   president, and what he does or does not do is completely irrelevant to the incoming administration and completely irrelevant to the Iranians. ” The Iran Sanctions Act extension passed unanimously in the Senate on Dec. 1. It extends the president’s authority to impose sanctions, a measure the Obama administration insisted did not affect the U. S. commitment to the deal or its ability to provide sanctions relief to Iran. The White House had said Obama would sign the bill into law, so his decision not to is a reversal. But the Senate is expected to take even broader steps against Iran next year, imposing more punitive measures and leaving the deal’s fate in limbo. Tehran has complained to the U. N. committee overseeing the deal’s implementation, saying the sanctions renewal is a “blatant contradiction” of what the parties that negotiated the deal agreed to.  In response to the vote in Congress, Iranian President  Hassan Rouhani this week ordered the development of    ships, a step some analysts believe is more a show of swagger than a real threat. Iran is contemplating additional steps in response to the sanctions renewal, an adviser to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said Wednesday. The rhetoric coming from Tehran underscores the uncertainty around the Iran deal’s very foundations as Washington prepares for the Trump presidency. It is not clear whether Obama’s symbolic gesture of keeping his name off the legislation will succeed in calming Tehran or ensuring the nuclear deal’s fate. “I think President Obama hopes to mitigate the Iranian response to   Trump’s tougher rhetoric on the deal,” said James Phillips, a Middle East analyst at the Heritage Foundation. “The White House is acting as if it’s on life support. ” The impending change of power in Washington may have political implications for the Iranian officials who put their political futures on the line to get an agreement after more than a decade of negotiations. Rouhani, whose administration pushed the deal forward as a way to end Iran’s economic isolation, is up for reelection in March. Some Iranians have complained that they are not seeing the economic benefits they expected from the nuclear deal, which could harm him at the polls. Iranian critics of the deal already have characterized him as being outmaneuvered by the Americans. “By the middle of 2017,” said Trita Parsi, head of the National Iranian American Council and a supporter of the deal, “you could have a president in Iran and a president in the United States who both ran on the same platform opposing the nuclear deal. ”     "

","  BEIJING  —   China is adding new antiaircraft weapons to a string of artificial islands in the middle of the disputed South China Sea, according to a report by U. S.   groups based on satellite analysis. The findings, drawn from a study by the Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative and the Center for Strategic and International Studies, appear to challenge vows by China’s leader last year not to “militarize” the area. In recent years, Beijing has turned scattered coral reefs into small, strategic outposts by piling sand and then building installations such as barracks, lighthouses and   airstrips. China claims sovereignty over the full South China Sea  —   in direct conflict with international rulings and other countries bordering the sea, including the Philippines and Vietnam. In a recent television interview,   Donald Trump accused Beijing of building a “massive fortress in the middle of the South China Sea. ”  Beijing maintains that these seven artificial islands serve civilian, not military, purposes.     China has laid claim to a number of islands in the South China Sea, building airbases on tiny spits of land while installing powerful radar and missile launchers. Here’s why. (Jason Aldag, Julie   Washington Post   Satellite photos courtesy of CSIS)   China’s Defense Ministry said in a statement published Thursday that any “necessary military facilities” were for “defense and  ” and were, therefore, “legitimate. ” “If someone shows off his muscles in your doorway,” the statement said, “shouldn’t you at least prepare a slingshot?”  The “muscle,” in this case, is the United States. Though Washington says it has no position on rival sovereignty claims in the South China Sea, the United States has been critical of China’s   and conducts patrols  —   officially called “freedom of navigation operations”  —   in the area. China sees the presence of U. S. ships as interference and has repeatedly said that it is the United States, not China, that wants to militarize the South China Sea. The standoff has been a   source of tension between Washington and Beijing, and nobody seems certain how Trump and his team will handle the dispute. On one hand, Trump has talked of putting “America first” and focusing more on domestic matters. On the other, his advisers have criticized the Obama administration’s “limited” response to China’s maritime claims.   The Chinese side, for its part, appears to be pushing ahead with its strategy of gradually adding new military features to the artificial islands. The report by the U. S. groups found that weapons systems spotted on the three largest islands China has built in the Spratlys  —   Fiery Cross, Mischief and Subi reefs  —   were an “evolution” of smaller systems previously seen on four other sites in the sea. The placement of the weapons showed that Beijing “is serious about defense of its artificial islands in case of an armed contingency in the South China Sea,” the report said.  “They would be the last line of defense against cruise missiles launched by the United States or others against these     air bases. ” There was no immediate U. S. response to the report. In a speech in Sydney on Wednesday, Adm. Harry Harris, head of the U. S. Pacific Command, suggested that the United States is ready to “confront” China at sea. “I’ve also been loud and clear that we will not allow the shared domains to be closed down  —   no matter how many bases are built on artificial features in the South China Sea,” he said. “I say this often, but it’s worth repeating  —   we will cooperate where we can and be ready to confront where we must. ”   Luna Lin in Beijing contributed to this report.

142276,217694,Former Milwaukee police officer charged with homicide for shooting that set off violent unrest,Washington Post,Mark Berman,2016-12-15,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161216005217/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2016/12/15/former-milwaukee-police-officer-charged-with-homicide-in-shooting-that-set-off-violent-unrest/
","     A former police officer in Milwaukee was charged with homicide Thursday for fatally shooting a man in August, an incident that sparked days of violent unrest on the city’s streets. Authorities said that while Sylville K. Smith was initially armed during his encounter with police, he had thrown his gun away and fallen to the ground when an officer fired a shot into his chest. Dominique   the officer, is already facing charges of sexual assault and prostitution stemming from accusations made while demonstrations over Smith’s shooting continued to roil Milwaukee.   24, was arrested in October on those charges and, not long after, fired by the Milwaukee Police Department.   fatally shot Smith, 23, after an August traffic stop in the city’s Sherman Park neighborhood. Police said Smith was chased by   and had turned to face the officer while holding a gun.  Authorities said that   was wearing a body camera when he fired at Smith, with the first shot hitting Smith in the arm and the second striking him in the chest. Edward A. Flynn, the Milwaukee police chief, had pushed back against suggestions that Smith was unarmed, saying that he had a gun in his hand when turning toward  . The criminal complaint filed Thursday in Milwaukee County court said that while Smith “was armed with a   pistol” when he ran away, he had already thrown it away and was unarmed when   fired the second of two shots. Body camera footage from the scene depicted Smith, gun in hand, turning his head and upper body toward the officers after he approached a   fence between two houses, according to the complaint, which cites Ricardo Tijerino, a special agent with the state’s Department of Justice, which investigated the shooting. Smith then “raises the gun upward” while looking toward the officers “and throws the gun over the fence into the yard,” according to the complaint. While Smith was lifting the gun,   fired one shot, hitting him in the right biceps. After being shot, Smith fell to the ground, and less than two seconds after the first shot was fired,   fired again, hitting him in the chest, the complaint continued. Authorities said that in an interview with investigators,   told them he fired the second shot because he believed Smith was reaching for his waist. Footage obtained from body cameras worn by   and another officer show “that at the time of the second shot, Smith was unarmed and had his hands near his head,” the complaint states. After the second shot, the complaint stated, Smith could be seen reaching his left hand toward his waist, but   told him to stop reaching and moved Smith’s hand away from his waist. “A review of the body camera footage shows that at no time after the shooting did   or any other officer search Smith for a second firearm,” the complaint states. “In fact, when Smith demonstrably reaches for his waistband after being shot the second time,   does not discharge his weapon, but moves Smith’s hand away with his own hand. ”  Officers are rarely charged for   shootings, and in those cases where charges are brought, convictions are even less common. Last week, a jury in South Carolina deadlocked in the case of a former South Carolina police officer recorded shooting a fleeing motorist after a traffic stop, much as a mistrial was declared in a case involving a former officer charged in Ohio.   is now the 79th officer charged with murder or manslaughter for an   shooting since 2005, according to Philip M. Stinson, a criminologist at Bowling Green State University in Ohio who studies arrests of officers. Out of that group, the same number of officers have been convicted (27) as have not been (30) Stinson said, while 22 other cases are pending. The number of officers charged has increased in recent years amid intense focus on how police use deadly force, and video evidence has increasingly been a factor in such cases. Smith is one of 912 people fatally shot by police officers in the United States this year, according to a Washington Post database tracking such shootings. His death set off volcanic anger in Wisconsin’s biggest city, with multiple buildings set on fire one night and bouts of gunfire the following night. Several law enforcement officers were wounded during the unrest, which made Milwaukee the latest in a series of U. S. cities to erupt after a death at the hands of police.    Former officer Dominique  . (Milwaukee County Sheriff’s Office via AP)  While city officials were trying to restore calm after the shooting, authorities were contacted by a man who told them that   had raped him. According to court documents, the man who made the report told investigators that he had gone to a bar with   where they “sat and watched television as coverage of the Sherman Park protests aired. ” This man told police he had difficulty remembering what happened after leaving the bar and said he woke up being assaulted, the criminal complaint states. When authorities began investigating this report, they discovered evidence that   had tried to offer two people money for sex, according to the complaint. Investigators also say they found images on his phone showing nude photos of another person, some showing sexual contact, but this person told police they did not consent to the photos or contact.  After   was arrested and, later, fired, the investigation into Smith’s shooting continued. Under Wisconsin law, any death involving a law enforcement officer must be investigated by an independent agency. The Wisconsin Department of Justice’s Division of Criminal Investigation finished its probe into the shooting in September, about a month after the shooting, and handed its findings over to Milwaukee County District Attorney John Chisholm for a decision about charges.   was charged Thursday with one count of   reckless homicide, according to court records. This is a felony described in state law as “recklessly [causing] the death of another human being under circumstances which show utter disregard for human life. ” If convicted,   could face up to 60 years in prison. No defense attorney was initially listed for him.   is still listed as an inmate in the county jail, and his address in the shooting case was listed as Milwaukee County’s Criminal Justice Facility, which houses that jail. He is scheduled to make an initial appearance in court Friday afternoon in the homicide case. There is also a status conference scheduled for Friday morning in his sexual assault case.

142277,217695,Facebook will start telling you when a story may be fake,Washington Post,Hayley Tsukayama,2016-12-15,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161216005217/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2016/12/15/facebook-will-start-telling-you-when-a-story-may-be-fake/
","         Facebook has struggled for months over whether it should crack down on false news stories and hoaxes that are being spread on its site. Now, it has finally come to a decision. The social network is going to partner with the Poynter International   Network, which includes groups such as Snopes, to evaluate articles flagged by Facebook users. If those articles do not pass the smell test for the   Facebook will label that evaluation whenever they are posted or shared, along with a link to the organization that debunked the story. “We have a responsibility to reduce the spread of fake news on our platform,” Adam Mosseri, Facebook vice president of product development, told The Washington Post. Mosseri said the social network still wants to be a place where people with all kinds of opinions can express themselves but has no interest in being the arbiter of what’s true and what’s not for its 1 billion users.   The new system will work like this: If a story on Facebook is patently false  —   saying that a celebrity is dead when they are still alive, for example  —   then users will see a notice that the story has been disputed or debunked. People who try to share stories that have been found false will also see an alert before they post. Flagged stories will appear lower in the news feed than unflagged stories. Users will also be able to report potentially false stories to Facebook or send messages directly to the person posting a questionable article.    (Courtesy of Facebook)  The company is focusing, for now, on what Mosseri called the “bottom of the barrel” websites that are purposefully set up to deceive and spread fake news, as well as those that are impersonating other news organizations. “We are not looking to flag legitimate organizations,” Mosseri said. “We’re looking for pages posing as legitimate organizations. ” Articles from legitimate sites that are controversial or even wrong should not get flagged, he said.  There is no blacklist of sites that will automatically be labeled, Mosseri said. But Facebook has built a sort of data profile of characteristics that   articles share  —   such as low share numbers after the headline is clicked  —   which it will use to decide when to have something  . The company will also prioritize checking stories that are getting lots of flags from users and are being shared widely, to go after the biggest targets possible.  If someone wants to appeal a label, they can direct that complaint to the   organization that made the call on whether an article was false. Facebook is also trying to crack down on people who have made a business in fake news by tweaking the social network’s advertising practices. Any article that has been disputed, for example, cannot be used in an ad. Facebook is also playing around with ways to limit links from publishers with landing pages that are mostly ads  —   a common tactic for   websites. With those measures in place, “we’re hoping financially motivated spammers might move away from fake news,” Mosseri said. All of these efforts, he said, are works in progress. Users will start seeing them Thursday, but Facebook is testing different options to see what works best. This round of efforts is the first of many that Facebook will try. “We don’t think it will get us all the way there,” he said. “I expect it to be something we need to invest in on an ongoing basis. ”"
142278,217696,Study: Black children are exposed to junk-food ads way more than white kids are,Washington Post,Caitlin Dewey,2016-12-15,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161216005217/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/12/15/study-black-children-are-exposed-to-junk-food-ads-way-more-than-white-kids-are/
","     There are few demographic groups in the U. S. that don’t struggle with obesity. But the disease takes a particularly dramatic toll on   communities. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, nearly half of all black adults are obese, as are 20 percent of kids. That’s what makes a new study on   ads all the more striking: It suggests that   chains,   and   increasingly are targeting black teens and children. The study, which was conducted by researchers at the University of Connecticut’s Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity and published Thursday in the journal Pediatric Obesity, analyzed Nielsen data from 2008 to 2012 to compare   viewing rates. It found that all children saw more TV and beverage ads in 2012 than in 2008, even though the amount of time kids spend watching TV has basically stayed the same. The analysis also found that black children are exposed to more   advertising than white kids are    as much as 50 percent more, in fact, among teens.   That finding was consistent with prior research. But while researchers have long assumed the disparity sprung from the fact that black kids watch more television, this study suggests that the gap also has a great deal to do with the types of television black kids watch    and marketers’ ability to target them on those specific networks.  Compared to their white peers, black children spend far more time watching “ ” and “ ” networks, such as Fuse,    BET and VH1. These are also the networks, researchers found, that air the most food advertisements. Frances   a marketing researcher at the Rudd Center and the lead author on the new report, does not believe that is a coincidence. “Determining the intentions of [food] companies is challenging,” she said. “But we use the same data that companies use to place their ads. Ads are placed to reach a certain demographic. ”   The placement of food ads    and the demographics they’re intended to reach    has become a subject of controversy in recent years. Multiple randomized trials, analyzed last October in the journal Obesity Reviews, have found a clear link between a child’s preference for unhealthy foods and exposure to unhealthy food marketing. Most food marketing is unhealthy: The Obesity Action Coalition, a nonprofit advocacy group, estimates that nine of every 10   food ads are for sugary drinks, cereals, sweets, snacks and fast foods. Cara Shipley, who coordinates an   program for kids of color in Baltimore, said her students can always identify, in a   the mascots and characters pictured in commercials.  An analysis of Nickelodeon programming  in the summer of 2015 found that 65 percent of the food ads shown in a   period were for “foods of poor nutritional quality,” including Baby Bottle Pops, Fruit Gushers and Frosted Flakes. Technically, all three of those foods meet the nutrition criteria established by the Childrenˈs Food and Beverage Advertising Initiative, a   program adopted by 17 major food companies in 2006 in response to criticisms of   marketing. It restricts the calories, saturated fats, sodium and total sugars that appear in food marketed to children under 12. The program’s nutrition standards are more lenient than many advocates would like, and they only apply, for the most part, to ads that appear on children’s networks. They do not consider children over 12, and they certainly don’t consider factors like children’s viewing patterns, race or obesity risk.    The food companies that spend the most on   TV, regardless of age group, as of 2015. (Rudd Center)  As a result, critics argue, manufacturers are still blitzing the most vulnerable kids with images of sugary snacks and fast food. This study found that, in 2008, black kids ages   to    saw 18. 6 food ads every day. In 2012, they saw 24. 2 ads    a 30 percent increase. “There’s so much discussion right now about kids and healthy eating,”   said. “But it’s hard to believe we can see an increase in healthy eating without decreasing the incessant exposure to [unhealthy] ads. ” How to decrease that exposure remains a matter of debate, however    as does the premise that kids over 12 should be protected from food marketing, at all. The World Health Organization recommends that governments take regulatory action to protect kids from   ads, and has even suggested the definition of ”kids” increase to age 16. In the U. S. the matter is left entirely to industry, which has repeatedly insisted both that their current standards have improved the nutritional quality of products advertised on kids’ TV, and that any expansion would unfairly impact their adult advertising. That leaves the matter to parents,   said, as well as educators in programs like Shipley’s. To counter the allure of the sports stars and musicians that appear in   ads, the program has begun printing posters with its own   local celebrities. “[The kids] are really influenced by what’s ‘cool,’” Shipley said. “We’re trying to reverse that    but the social pressure is huge. ” More from Wonkblog:  You could soon pay more money for worse food. Thanks, Donald Trump.   Researchers have found a ‘striking’ new side effect from eating fast food   Trump doesn’t threaten only President Obama’s legacy. He could ruin Michelle Obama’s, too.   "

","  CAIRO  —   Traces of explosives have been found on some of the victims of an EgyptAir flight from Paris that plunged into the Mediterranean Sea in May, killing all 66 people aboard, Egypt’s Civilian Aviation Ministry said Thursday. In a statement, the ministry said that it was notified by Egyptian investigators and that a criminal investigation into the crash of Flight 804 will be carried out. The statement provided no further details. There has been plenty of speculation that terrorists may have targeted the Airbus A320, but no group has asserted responsibility. However, Thursday’s revelation is likely to intensify concerns about Egypt’s aviation security and further damage its sagging tourism industry, an important source of foreign currency.

And two days earlier, a bomb killed six police officers and injured three others on a road leading to the iconic Giza pyramids.  The crash of Flight 804 occurred seven months after a Russian commercial airliner went down in the Sinai Peninsula shortly after taking off from the Egyptian resort town of Sharm  . All people on board died. The local branch of the Islamic State militant group asserted responsibility for the attack, saying it had planted a bomb on the plane. That assault prompted Russia to halt all civilian flights to Egypt, while Britain and other nations suspended flights to Sharm   which accounts for a third of Egypt’s annual tourism revenue.       "
142280,217698,The unintended consequence of Angelina Jolie’s viral breast cancer essay,Washington Post,Carolyn Y. Johnson,2016-12-15,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161216005217/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/12/15/why-doctors-cant-ignore-celebrities-the-angelina-jolie-effect/
","     When Angelina Jolie published an essay in the New York Times about her decision in 2013 to get a double mastectomy, the essay quickly went viral. Jolie’s frank and candid admission that she had inherited a ”faulty” BRCA1 gene that increased her risk of developing breast and ovarian cancer and struggled with what to do struck a chord with people. Jolie revealed that she had undergone a medical procedure rarely talked about openly, much less by   celebrities, and said she hoped her experience could help others. ”Today it is possible to find out through a blood test whether you are highly susceptible to breast and ovarian cancer, and then take action,” Jolie wrote. A new study published in the British Medical Journal found that thousands of additional women got tested for mutations in the breast cancer risk genes in the U. S.    but probably not the right women. Testing rates increased 64 percent in the three weeks after Jolie’s editorial, compared with the three weeks before, according to researchers at Harvard Medical School. The study can’t prove that Jolie’s essay caused the bump in testing, but researchers did not find a similar increase in test rates over the same time period the previous year. Meanwhile, the mastectomy rates among women who had a genetic test actually declined after the piece was published, suggesting the women who got the tests done weren’t as likely to have the mutation.  And all that testing comes at a cost: The researchers estimated 4, 500 additional genetic tests were performed, at a cost of $13. 5 million. ”The ’Jolie effect’ is real,” said Timothy Caulfield, a professor of law at the University of Alberta who focuses on health policy and was not involved in the study. ”One way to interpret that is that people who didn’t need to get the test got the test. That didn’t necessarily result in this targeted information campaign where people that were genuinely at increased risk and needed this test were getting this.” The study suggests a   sword when celebrities talk about health issues. ”Our findings suggest that celebrity endorsements can be extremely effective and relatively   compared to a lot of public health awareness campaigns,” said Sunita Desai, a health care economist at Harvard Medical School who led the study. But they may not start the discussion among the people actually at greatest risk. Jolie’s essay was a disclosure, not an endorsement    a window into her own   when facing a scary prognosis. It was thoughtful and restrained and clearly noted that Jolie’s risks weren’t typical of most women who develop breast cancer. ”Only a fraction of breast cancers result from an inherited gene mutation,” she wrote. But the essay had a profound effect nonetheless, suggesting medical professionals may want to pay attention when celebrities talk about their own health. Actor Ben Stiller recently credited a prostate cancer screening test with saving his life, raising concerns that more men will get a form of screening that medical experts say causes more harm than good.  The downside of excessive testing may seem minimal. Maybe the women who got tested were unlikely to carry the gene mutation, but what’s the harm in knowing? One answer is that the test cost, on average, $3, 000. Unnecessary testing can waste limited health care resources and may also cause stress. But another way to answer the question is to think about the major causes of breast cancer in women. Most women who develop breast cancer never inherited a faulty BRCA gene; they develop cancer for other reasons. Learning a negative test result could possibly make them less cautious about other forms of prevention or screening. ”The negative effect of that disclosure is the women who went and had these tests, which came back negative now have a false sense of security that they weren’t going to develop breast cancer    which is totally wrong, because they still have the    population” risk of the general public, said Mark Boguski, a pathologist who works at the company Inspirata and   books about what people can learn from celebrity illness.

142281,217699,Report ranks best and worst agencies for federal employees,Washington Post,Joe Davidson | Columnist,2016-12-15,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161216005217/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2016/12/15/report-ranks-best-and-worst-agencies-for-federal-employees/
","     Just in time for the holidays comes the “Best Places to Work in the Federal Government” report, filled with good tidings and bad news for federal agencies. The annual report is awaited each year by top officials who want to look good and avoid embarrassment. That makes sense, because the ratings are a reflection on their leadership. But more than simply showing who is up and who is down, the Best Places report slices and dices data to show why employees are engaged in their work or not. Engagement pays off in productivity and service to the public. Used properly, the report is a workforce road map, providing signs on how to improve employee morale. Best Places is published by the Partnership for Public Service and the Deloitte consulting firm, using data from the Office of Personnel Management’s Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey (FEVS). Among the key findings:  The   employee engagement index score rose by 1. 3 points to 59. 4 this year. The Obama administration can feel proud of this    increase, but this is still well behind the high of 65 in 2010. Things are getting better. More than 72 percent of all agencies increased their scores in 2016, compared with 70 percent last year. These two years represent vast improvement over the 43 percent that increased in 2014 and the lowly 24 percent in 2013. “The 2016   data show improvement in employees’ views of all 10 workplace categories for the second straight year. The biggest increase came in effective leadership, which still ranks 9th out of the 10 workplace categories. ” The federal government lags behind employee engagement in the private sector, which is rated at 77. “However, 12 federal agencies scored above the private sector average. ”  The Best Place index score is based on 100 points and is determined by three survey questions on recommending an agency as a good place to work, job satisfaction and satisfaction with the employee’s organization. The Partnership said one of the reasons it developed the ratings was “to hold agency leaders accountable for the health of their organizations. ” The ratings indicate that the best places to work are NASA, among large agencies; the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. among midsize agencies; the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) among small agencies; and the Office of the Inspector General at the Tennessee Valley Authority, among subcomponent agencies. The worst places to work in the same categories are the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) the Broadcasting Board of Governors, the Federal Election Commission and the Secret Service. Communication is an important factor in the ratings. “I believe that the key to our rating increase this year has to do with including our entire staff in determining our organizational values and in celebrating our agencies accomplishments,” said Jane Chu, chairman of NEA. It jumped from number 11 last year. “It is very important to have open and transparent channels of communication, as well as a safe space for new and independent thinking. The ratings tell us that we are on the right track in providing this type of environment for our staff to do its best work. ” The report points to a highly   federal workforce suffering from poor leadership. “This is troubling because effective leadership remains the key motivating force for employees,” said a Partnership statement. Many of the rankings were no surprise. NASA has been No. 1 in its category for five straight years. That’s not because of space, said Max Stier, the Partnership’s president and chief executive. ” “It’s because Charlie Bolden [NASA’s administrator] is a great leader. ” That’s not to say all agencies with low ratings have  bad management. DHS, for example, has resided at the bottom of its category for five straight years, but it scored the group’s second largest improvement. When the department’s improved FEVS results were released in September, Secretary Jeh Johnson and Alejandro Mayorkas, then the deputy secretary, participated in a conference call with reporters that demonstrated their pride in the progress. Yet, the Secret Service, a DHS component, dropped for the fifth straight year and is last among 305 government agency subcomponents. In another worrisome sign, the Social Security Administration registered the largest fall in employee engagement, dropping 2. 9 points. “No other large agency saw its score fall by more than 0. 7 points in 2016,” the Partnership reported. “Best in class   organizations understand that improved employee engagement leads to better performance and improved outcomes,” Stier said. “People are our government’s greatest asset, and the new administration should commit itself to strengthening the federal workforce and improving workforce culture. ” So far, no such commitment is evident from   Donald Trump’s team.

142282,217700,Yoga pants are comfy. They’re also an assault on manners and a nihilistic threat.,Washington Post,Kerry Folan,2016-12-15,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161216005217/https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2016/12/15/yoga-pants-are-comfy-theyre-also-an-assault-on-manners-and-a-nihilistic-threat/
","     I recently left New York, where I was a fashion editor for nearly a decade, to attend graduate school in the suburbs of D. C. where I grew up. I’m happy to be home in most ways, but there’s one suburban habit that I can’t get used to: yoga pants. Women in my neighborhood go about their entire day in yoga pants and running shoes. Moms with strollers, undergrads on campus, girlfriends meeting up for coffee dates or errands  —   I have even seen women dressed this way for cocktails. At first I thought this must be a suburban thing. In New York, I didn’t know anyone who left the house in gym clothes, unless he or she was actually going to the gym. In fact, I once had a roommate who was the director of a fancy children’s gymnasium down the street from our apartment in Brooklyn. She would get fully dressed each morning, including hair, makeup, and heels, just to walk the 10 blocks to work and then get undressed again. I loved her for this. I loved all of New York for this  —   for always putting in a little extra effort, for never taking the easy way out. In New York, after all, 10 million people are always looking. But yoga pants aren’t just a suburban trend. Athleisure is the name given to a class of street clothes that adopt the look and comfort of gym wear but are not designed for any actual sweating. It’s been a trend on the runways and in retail over the past few years, with forecasters predicting it to be one of the biggest sellers this holiday season. And I’m against it.  Lululemon, the activewear company, is the fairy godmother of athleisure. Though the company might be best known for its ubiquitous black yoga pants, founders Chip Wilson and his wife Shannon acknowledge that they always intended to make garments so flattering and stylish that women would want to wear them all day. The Wilsons take full credit for the current yoga pant craze: “I walk down the street, and I see women in their tights and their running shoes and a jacket, and I think, ‘We started that!’ ” Shannon Wilson said in an interview. Why have black leggings become the uniform of my generation? At least part of the appeal is our increasing interest in everything  . As our lives become more   we seem to want everything sleeker, smaller, smarter and more efficient  —   in a word, easier. This includes our clothing. Jeans used to be the American woman’s most versatile wardrobe staple, but, as Nike chief executive Mark Parker recently announced, “leggings are the new denim,” giving credence to the otherwise ridiculous   hypothesis, embraced by Hollywood costume designers since the 1950s, that the humans will someday uniformly dress in slick, Lycra unitards. Welcome to the future.  As someone who cares about fashion, I vote for jeans over yoga pants (or Lycra unitards) any day, but my stance isn’t just about aesthetics. It’s about manners. There is a photograph I love of my grandmother and her family at the 1948 Macy’s Day Parade in New York City. She’s dressed smartly for November weather in a black wool coat and a hazel circle skirt. With her red lipstick and hair set in waves, she looks comfortable but elegant. Her sons, holding balloons, are dressed casually but appropriately in navy pea coats and argyle sweaters. There’s a simplicity and a dignity to the image that speaks to the core values of my grandparents’ generation. Getting dressed wasn’t about vanity (or, rather, it wasn’t just about vanity); it was good manners.    (Courtesy of Kerry Folan)  What we wear sends a message to the world. An Hermes handbag makes a statement about wealth and luxury. A pair of   Louboutin heels makes a statement about sex and power. Yoga pants make a statement about comfort and modernity. When we board a flight or run to the grocery store swaddled in   we are saying to the people around us that our own comfort is our first priority. We are expressing a new kind of modern vanity where dressing down, rather than dressing up, is the power move. And I confess, I’m just as guilty of wearing yoga pants as anyone else. There have been plenty of occasions since I moved back to the suburbs that I’ve thrown on a pair of black leggings and gone about my day. Recently, I wore yoga pants and sneakers to tutor a student I regularly work with. He is from China, a single father raising a son while studying for a master’s degree in a second language. He comes to see me for tutoring twice a week because, though he is bright and he understands the concepts he studies, articulating his ideas in written English is a struggle for him. He has to work even harder than his classmates to complete his assignments. He took notice of my outfit. “You look comfortable today!” he said to me. He was right: I was comfortable. I also wished immediately that I was wearing real clothes. It felt disrespectful  —   elitist, even  —   to approach our tutoring session with my own comfort so obviously on display. The moment shook me up. When did I stop bothering to get dressed every day, I wondered? I lived in New York, where everything is hard, for almost a decade; at what point did I start buying into the idea that easier and more comfortable necessarily means better? And that’s when I realized that my gripe with yoga pants goes beyond bad manners. Like many pet peeves, this one is rooted in a private fear: I’m afraid of getting too comfortable. Part of the reason I love the way New Yorkers dress is that I see it as a metaphor for everything else I loved about the city  —   the work ethic, the energy, the specific kind of community that comes from collective ambition. Maybe it’s precisely because I love those elements of city life that I am wary of the seductive promise of suburban comfort: Why walk when I can drive? Why go shopping when I can order online? Why go out at all when I can lie on my giant couch and watch my giant TV? Why even get dressed today? Without the external energy of the city urging me on every day, will I find my own internal reasons to keep working harder than I strictly have to? Or will I soften, get lazy? Will I spend the rest of my life going about my day in comfort, coming home in the evening to nurse a bottle of wine until it’s time to go to bed on the quiet second story of my house, only to wake up and do it all again, wearing the same black yoga pants as the day before? It’s possible that I will. But one way I know to fight that fate: Get dressed each morning.      At Lainey Morse’s Oregon farm, you can do yoga with kids. Goat kids. (Reuters)   "

"," FBI Director James B. Comey and Director of National Intelligence James R. Clapper Jr. are in agreement with a CIA assessment that Russia intervened in the 2016 election in part to help Donald Trump win the presidency, according to U. S. officials.  Comey’s support for the CIA’s conclusion reflects the fact that the leaders of the three agencies have always been in agreement on Russian intentions, officals said, contrary to suggestions by some lawmakers that the FBI disagreed with the CIA. “Earlier this week, I met separately with (Director) FBI James Comey and DNI Jim Clapper, and there is strong consensus among us on the scope, nature, and intent of Russian interference in our presidential election,” CIA Director John Brennan said in a message to the agency’s workforce, according to U. S. officials who have seen the message.  “The three of us also agree that our organizations, along with others, need to focus on completing the thorough review of this issue that has been directed by President Obama and which is being led by the DNI,” Brennan’s message read.      (The Washington Post)    Trump has consistently dismissed the intelligence community’s findings about Russian hacking. The CIA and FBI declined to comment. The CIA shared its latest assessment with key senators in a   briefing on Capitol Hill about two weeks ago in which agency officials cited a growing body of intelligence from multiple sources. Specifically, CIA briefers told the senators it was now “quite clear” that electing Trump was one of Russia’s goals, according to the officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence matters. CIA and FBI officials do not think Russia had a “single purpose” by intervening during the presidential campaign. In addition to helping Trump, intelligence officials have told lawmakers that Moscow’s other goal included undermining confidence in the U. S. electoral system. A separate House intelligence briefing by a senior FBI counterintelligence official last week left some Republican and Democratic lawmakers with the impression that the bureau wasn’t on the same page as the CIA, according to officials present. “The truth is they were never all that different in the first place,” an official said of the FBI and CIA positions. In his message to the CIA’s workforce, Brennan said the administration has provided detailed briefings to lawmakers and their aides since the summer.

142284,217706,Clinton blames Putin’s personal grudge against her for election interference,Washington Post,Abby Phillip,2016-12-16,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161217000254/https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/clinton-blames-putins-personal-grudge-against-her-for-election-interference/2016/12/16/12f36250-c3be-11e6-8422-eac61c0ef74d_story.html
"," At a “thank you” event Thursday night with some of her top campaign donors and fundraisers, Hillary Clinton blamed a personal grudge by Russian President Vladimir Putin for unprecedented interference in the election that resulted in her defeat. Clinton said that in 2011, when she was secretary of state and Putin was planning his return to power, she spoke out against the “phony” parliamentary election that independent analysts concluded was rife with problems and fraud. “At the same time, citizens of Russia were pouring into the streets to protest. . . . People who were outraged because they thought they were on a trajectory of greater freedom, greater opportunity, and they watched that, and they were appalled,” Clinton said according to the recording posted Friday by the New York Times. “Putin publicly blamed me for the outpouring of outrage by his own people. And that is the direct line between what he said back then and what he did in this election,” she added.  Two people who attended the event confirmed the authenticity of the audio of Clinton’s roughly   remarks. Some of her most loyal supporters in the audience were surprised to hear her so directly describe a connection between her interaction with Putin during her time as secretary of state and the hacks targeting Democrats and the party’s institutions during the campaign, one person in attendance said. Privately, Clinton has long said that Putin personally disliked her, that person said. “There was a lot of suspicion about what the hell was going on,” said the person, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations with senior campaign aides. “Internally, the comments were ‘Putin really hates her.’ ” But she has never publicly described Russia’s interference in those terms. Clinton also discussed the letters from FBI Director James B. Comey in the final weeks of the election, announcements that she said caused voters in swing states to break against her in the final days of the campaign. But the bulk of her remarks were focused on Russia. Clinton called for an independent investigation, modeled after the   Commission, to look into Russian interference in the election. “This is not just an attack against me and my campaign  —   although that may have added fuel to it. This is an attack against our country,” Clinton said. “We are well beyond normal political concerns here. “This is about the integrity of our democracy and the security of our nation,” she said. The crowd can be heard cheering her on as she spoke.   Donald Trump has repeatedly rejected the assessment of the nation’s intelligence community and the White House that the Russian government was responsible for the hacking. Most recently, in an interview this week on Fox News Sunday, he said: “Personally, it could be Russia. I don’t really think it is, but who knows?” Also present at the event at the Plaza Hotel, in Manhattan, were her husband, former president Bill Clinton; Huma Abedin, one of Clinton’s closest aides; her campaign chairman John Podesta; her campaign manager, Robby Mook; and Dennis Cheng, the campaign’s finance director. Clinton’s running mate, Sen. Tim Kaine ( .) also attended and introduced Clinton. Although the Democratic Party is in the midst of   another attendee at the event said that the news of the Russian hacking in the election was at the front of everyone’s minds. Clinton, Podesta and others who spoke did not  —   as has been their custom  —   offer any personal reflection about what they might have done differently. The top donors who were assembled also seemed willing to keep the focus on external factors. “If they have anger and frustration, it’s not directed internally; it’s directed at the news media, the Russians, the FBI,” said another person who attended the gathering.

","     Hillary Clinton, in audio just unearthed by the New York Times, offers her most unvarnished accounting of her 2016 election defeat yet. And while it’s no surprise that she blames FBI Director James B. Comey  —   she’s done that before, if a bit less forcefully  —   she also points pretty squarely at another “unprecedented,”   actor: Russia. Here’s a partial transcript of Clinton’s comments to campaign donors Thursday night: There were some unprecedented factors that I don’t think we can ignore, because to do so is at our peril. Now, don’t take it from me. Take it from independent analysts. Take it from the Trump campaign. Take it from Nate Silver, who’s pointed out that   voters made their decisions in the final days, breaking against me, because of the FBI letter from Director Comey. And Nate Silver believes  —   I happen to believe this  —   that that letter most likely made the difference in the outcome. But we’re also learning something more every day about the unprecedented Russian plot to swing this election. And this is something every American should be worried about. You know, we have to recognize that, as the latest reports made clear, Vladimir Putin himself directed the covert cyber attacks against our electoral system, against our democracy, apparently because he has a personal beef against me. Clinton later added, in reference to Russia’s meddling, that “the press is finally catching up to the facts, which we desperately tried to present to them during the last months of the campaign. ” Clinton doesn’t directly say “I lost because of Russia”  —   at least not as directly as she says it about Comey  —   but it wasn’t as if she brought it up simply to make a case about cybersecurity; she brought it up in the context of the “unprecedented factors” that led to her loss. Right after she points to late deciders voting against her because of Comey, she brings up Russia. And Clinton isn’t the only one entertaining the idea that Russia made the difference. President Obama said in a new NPR interview that Russia’s meddling changed the “atmosphere” of the race and dominated the news coverage in a way that crowded out other issues and advantaged Trump in a clear way. Obama told Steve Inskeep: That whole swirl that ended up dominating the news meant that number one, issues weren’t talked about a lot in the coverage, huge policy differences were not debated and vetted. It also meant that what I think would have been a big advantage for Hillary objectively, her experience, her  —   her knowledge, her outstanding reputation around the world as secretary of State, all that stuff got lost. And I think in that scrum, in that swirl, you know, Donald Trump and his celebrity and his ability to garner attention and obviously tap into a lot of the anxiety and fears that some voters have I think definitely made a difference. But did it actually make a difference? Obama then put on his political   cap and left it open as a possibility. “Elections can always turn out differently,” he said. “You never know which factors are going to make a difference. But I have no doubt that it had some impact, just based on the coverage. ” Obama was very diplomatic about this, but he’s clearly not disputing the idea that Russia may have changed the results of the 2016 election; that’s the inescapable extension of his comments. He was asked a direct question about whether it “could have turned out differently,” and Obama’s answer was decidedly far from “no. ” And in fact, Obama seems to think Russian meddling mattered in a very big way by essentially turning the entire debate away from Clinton’s strengths. Obama emphasized during the same interview that he didn’t want to start “ ” the 2016 election, but the problem with looking at Russia’s role is that this is inherently part of the process. The fact is that Trump’s margin of victory was so small  —   less than 1 percentage point in the three states that mattered: Michigan (0. 2 percent) Pennsylvania (0. 7) and Wisconsin (0. 8)  —   that even a small shift could have made the difference. If Russia’s meddling moved the vote in every state just one point toward Trump, it made the difference. This is a big reason Republicans have been reluctant to go down this road. Even those who may be legitimately worried about Russia’s meddling know it’s not hard to draw the line from A to B to C: The Russians meddled on Trump’s behalf, and Trump won by a very small margin (about 80, 000 votes) so it’s quite possible Russia tipped the scales in the election. The comments from Clinton and Obama aren’t likely to make them feel better about entertaining this investigation and all the questions that come with it. If the conclusion of that investigation is that Russia penetrated deeply and was able to influence the process in a serious way, there will always be that doubt about whether it made the difference and whether Trump would have been president without it. We may never know for sure, but as Clinton and Obama demonstrate, plenty of people will have their suspicions."

","     President Obama said Friday that his administration did not ascribe motives to Russia’s alleged meddling in the 2016 campaign ahead of Election Day because he did not want to be seen as influencing the outcome in favor of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. “Anything said by me or anyone in this White House would immediately be seen through a partisan lens,” Obama said at a   news conference. “I wanted to make sure everybody understood we were playing this thing straight. That we were not trying to advantage one side or the other. ”  Obama defended his administration’s handling of the investigation into the hacking of private emails from top Democratic Party officials, amid reports that U. S. intelligence officials have concluded that Russian operatives used the stolen materials to try to help Republican Donald Trump win the election. The FBI has now joined the CIA in that assessment. Clinton has cited the stolen emails, which were made public by WikiLeaks, as a factor in her upset loss to Trump, and her former campaign John Podesta blasted the FBI for focusing more aggressively on investigating her use of a private email server than on Russia’s involvement.  Obama emphasized that his administration publicly accused Russian actors of being behind the email theft in early fall and noted that reporters speculated that the disclosure of the private messages was made to embarrass Clinton and other Democrats during a   campaign. The president suggested that the public was free to interpret the motives behind the leaks for themselves. “What we were trying to do was let people know that this had taken place so that if you started seeing some effect on the election, if you were trying to measure why this was happening and how you should consume the information that was being leaked, that you might want to take this into account,” Obama said. “And that was exactly how we should have handled it. Imagine if we had done the opposite. Then it would have become just one more political scrum. ” Obama added that “part of the goal here was to make sure we did not do the work of the leakers for them by raising more and more questions about the integrity of the election right before the election was going to take place. ” Obama has pledged to respond to Russia’s actions with punitive measures, but he did not offer more details about when or how he might do so. Obama suggested that he believed Russian President Vladimir Putin knew about the hacking, and he said he warned Putin to ”cut it out” during an international summit in the fall. The president said he did not denounce Russia more forcefully in public leading up to the election because he did not think that would have any effect. ”Folks out there who somehow suggest that if we went out there and made a big comment and thumped our chest about a bunch of stuff, that somehow that would potentially spoke the Russians?” he said. ”The idea that public shaming is going to be effective doesn’t read the thought process in Russia very well.” Obama noted that Trump has been complimentary of Putin and he expressed frustration at Republican leaders who have refrained from criticizing Russia since Trump’s victory. The president cited a poll from the Economist and YouGov that said 37 percent of voters approved of Putin. ”The former head of the [Soviet spy agency] KGB,” Obama said. ”Ronald Reagan would roll over in his grave at how that happened.”  "
142287,217709,Pentagon: Chinese naval ship seized an unmanned U.S. ocean glider in South China Sea,Washington Post,Missy Ryan,2016-12-16,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161217000254/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/checkpoint/wp/2016/12/16/defense-official-chinese-naval-ship-seized-an-unmanned-u-s-ocean-glider/
","     A Chinese naval ship seized an underwater naval drone that was being used by the U. S. Navy to test water conditions in the South China Sea, the Pentagon said Friday. Navy Capt. Jeff Davis, a Pentagon spokesman, said the incident occurred on Dec. 15 about 50 nautical miles northwest of Subic Bay, in international waters in the South China Sea. The USNS Bowditch, an oceanographic survey vessel with a mostly civilian crew, was in the process of recovering two unmanned ocean gliders, which are used to collect information about water conditions that can help U. S. vessels operate. A Chinese ship, a   class submarine rescue vessel, approached the area, coming within about 500 yards of the Bowditch before dropping a small boat in the water. It seized one of the gliders and brought it aboard, Davis said. The Bowditch contacted the Chinese ship and asked for the glider to be returned. Officials aboard the Chinese ship acknowledged the radio communication, Davis said, but said they were returning to normal operations. The ship then left the area. “We would like it back and we would like this not to happen again,” Davis said, referring to the underwater drone. The incident occurred around 1:45 p. m. local time, the Navy said.    A defense official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the matter on the record, said the United States has made an official diplomatic communication to the Chinese government, “demanding the return of our stuff. ” There was no immediate response from Beijing, the official said. The incident comes amid mounting tensions over Beijing’s territorial claims in the South China Sea, which have alarmed U. S. allies in the region and prompted the U. S. military to conduct “freedom of navigation” operations intended as a show of force. This week, a U. S. think tank reported that China has placed antiaircraft weapons on artificial islands, threatening to intensify the debate over disputed areas. Davis said ships such as the Bowditch routinely conduct operations in the South China Sea. The Navy said the drones are operated by the Naval Oceanographic Office, which says it maintains the largest glider fleet in the world with more than 130 such “littoral battlespace sensing” crafts. A Navy fact sheet said the gliders are piloted by civilian employees of the oceanographic office from Stennis Space Center in Mississippi through the use of encrypted satellite communications. They typically travel just a few miles per hour and are tracked by oceanographic vessels such as the USNS Bowditch. The data the drones collect is unclassified. It’s not clear how   Donald Trump, who has been the subject of Chinese government ire since his recent outreach to leadership of Taiwan, will approach those maritime disputes. But he has criticized Beijing for “building a massive fortress in the middle of the South China Sea,” in addition to his complaints about Chinese monetary and trade policies. Patrick Cronin, an expert on   security at the Center for a New American Security, called the seizure “a brazen, calculated act of coercive diplomacy” and said it was intended to send a message to Trump ahead of his inauguration. “Rather than wait several weeks, Beijing is advancing a provocative action offshore from a U. S. ally that had recently kowtowed to China,” Cronin said, referring to the incident’s location near the Philippines. The signal China wishes to send is unambiguous, he added: “‘If you challenge our sovereignty we will challenge yours.’ The U. S. response needs to be equally clear: if anyone messes with with our Navy the response will not be limited to words. ”      China has laid claim to a number of islands in the South China Sea, building airbases on tiny spits of land while installing powerful radar and missile launchers. Here’s why.

","     President Obama has occasionally used his podium to assume the position of    . The guy regularly slams Fox News; he voiced concerns in September about the reporting on Donald Trump; and he has a fixation on fake news. Moments ago, in his    press conference at the White House, Obama took direct aim at his audience: scores of mainstream media correspondents and cameras. The topic was the response of news organizations to a series of email hacks presented by WikiLeaks in the heat of the 2016 presidential election. In carefully timed increments, WikiLeaks posted databases of correspondence from the Democratic National Committee and from Hillary Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta. These dumps weren’t dumps at all in one key respect  —   they were highly searchable, the better to aid an   media. They launched an untold number of stories, and the president noticed. “I’m finding it a little curious that everybody acted surprised that it looked like this was disadvantaging Hillary Clinton, because you guys wrote about it every day,” said Obama. “Every single leak, about every little juicy tidbit of political gossip including John Podesta’s risotto recipe. This was an obsession that dominated the news coverage, so I do think it’s worth us reflecting how it is that a presidential election of such importance, of such moment with so much at stake and such a contrast between the candidates, came to be dominated by a bunch of these leaks. ” Further: “What is it about our political system that made us vulnerable to these kinds of potential manipulations, which as I’ve said publicly before were not particularly sophisticated?” Easy: the First Amendment, that’s what. It’s one of the great mechanisms of accountability that could possibly be conceived: Our media organizations are held harmless for disseminating newsworthy information that may have been illegally obtained by other parties, whatever motives they may have. Glenn Greenwald and company didn’t score their Pulitzer   scoops on the U. S. surveillance state by filing Freedom of Information Act requests; they got the information from Edward Snowden, who grabbed them from the systems to which he had access as a National Security Agency contractor. Nor was standard, officially sanctioned procedure at play when Chelsea Manning served up a trove of compelling documents to WikiLeaks. And Daniel Ellsberg was charged with theft and violating the Espionage Act for his leaks of the Pentagon Papers, though the case against him was eventually dismissed. There’ll be no argument here that the leaks from the DNC and Podesta reached the level of public concern of the foregoing unauthorized transfers. For example, Podesta’s risotto recipe, which Obama noted in mocking the importance of these recent leaks. Perhaps the president doesn’t share the news judgment of Food & Wine, Eater. com and Mother Jones  —   for all of which the revelations about arborio rice and liquid were newsworthy. Putting aside the newsy stuff in the emails regarding the Clinton campaign’s cogitations about strategy and the DNC’s handling of the presidential primary, let’s consider merely what WikiLeaks revealed about media organizations. The primary story here related to how CNN and partner organizations run   events and debates. Deep in the digital archive were emails showing that Donna Brazile, a CNN contributor and a DNC vice chair, passed along questions to the Clinton campaign before two CNN events in March 2016. Though CNN denied  —   pretty plausibly  —   that she secured these questions from the network’s hallowed   team, the breaches were nonetheless significant: Though opinions vary on many matters of journalism ethics, there’s quite a bit of agreement that political candidates shouldn’t get a   on questions. Were this an   tidbit, surely CNN Worldwide President Jeff Zucker would have dismissed all questions about it. Instead, he addressed it on more than one occasion, at one point characterizing the behavior as “disgusting. ” That wasn’t the extent of WikiLeaks’ grist for media reporters. Other emails showed a worrying degree of collaboration  —   some would say collusion  —   between reporters and Democratic operatives, not to mention insights from campaign officials on how they viewed media organizations, which could be relied upon for friendly treatment and on and on. So: What looked to Obama like an “obsession” was more like a bunch of stories with   integrity: These were actual, live email conversations among very important Beltway types, despite various attempts to suggest that the documents could be doctored. It was just the sort of information that reporters commonly seek in FOIA requests once officials such as these graduate from a campaign to jobs in government. Today The Post is reporting on a   consensus that Russia intervened in the election in part to assist the Trump campaign, via its hacks of the DNC and Podesta. That’s a troubling revelation, and clearly there are a number of media actors who feel conflicted about using the information that was presented on a platter worthy of Mr. Carson. “Every major publication, including The Times, published multiple stories citing the D. N. C. and Podesta emails posted by WikiLeaks, becoming a de facto instrument of Russian intelligence,” wrote the New York Times this week in a passage widely shared on social media. Unfair? No question. WikiLeaks didn’t post corresponding emails from the Republican National Committee or from the Trump campaign. They would have been newsworthy as well, as would the emails of just about any organization of public concern. But on this front, the media is in an awkward and strangely helpless position. Though we may exploit all manner of documents presented to us, we may not implore foreign state actors to steal and leak in a fair and balanced manner. We’ll leave that sort of conduct to our  ."

","  The good news: Both the left and the right have reached consensus that free speech is important.  The bad news: “Free speech” has apparently been redefined to mean “speech with which I agree. ”  Over the past few years, there have been many   cases of   college students or their cowed administrators chilling the public discourse (by disinviting speakers, censoring artwork, disciplining transgressors of arbitrarily imposed cultural appropriation rules, threatening to defund school newspapers, etc. ). Such actions have often been accompanied by dutiful statements about the campus’s commitment to free and open dialogue. Silencing some people’s speech was supposedly necessary to make other speakers feel “safe. ”   Now, the right has (re) discovered that two can play at this game.  In a disturbing series of events, conservative organizations have been claiming the mantle of free speech in service of suppressing campus speech they dislike, too.   The most recent case involves professor Olga Perez Stable Cox at Orange Coast College in California. An anonymous student in her human sexuality class secretly recorded Cox discussing her political views. She referred to Donald Trump as a “white supremacist,” his running mate Mike Pence “as one of the most   humans in this country” and their election as an “act of terrorism. ” Her words were clearly liberal  —   and hyperbolic, although perhaps not as hyperbolic as they initially seemed: In the days since her “act of terrorism” talk ripped across the Internet, she has received terroristic death threats herself. Cox has since fled the state. Meanwhile, the Orange Coast College Republicans  —   the group that disseminated the gotcha video  —   is campaigning for her firing. The group’s president said that expunging commentary such as hers from campus is necessary to ensure the college’s commitment to “diversity, equity and inclusivity. ”  If this language sounds familiar, it’s because it’s eerily similar to the    rhetoric often used by the left to stamp out words and ideas it dislikes, too. Unsurprisingly, conservative pundits convinced that U. S. colleges are leftist indoctrination camps have taken up the Republican students’ cause. Fox News’s Bill O’Reilly referred to the professor’s words as an “assault” on her students  —   conflating words with physical violence in the same way liberals so often do.  “Now we have the totalitarian left in America, and if you don’t see it their way, you’re attacked and demonized,” he said, after attacking and demonizing this professor. O’Reilly called on governors and legislators to monitor college classrooms more directly to prevent professors from “harming students with insane ideology. ” This sounds an awful lot like an attempt to coerce educators into using only    —   dare I say “politically correct”?  —   language. In a similar vein, the conservative group Turning Point USA recently published a “Professor Watchlist,” a catalogue of what it thinks are dangerous and “ ” professors who deserve public shaming for allegedly trying to “advance a radical agenda in lecture halls. ” (Among those “radical agenda” items: advocating gun control, calling Ted Cruz’s infamous “New York values” statement  .) The watchlist homepage of course includes a disclaimer that Turning Point will “continue to fight for free speech and the right for professors to say whatever they wish. ”   It’s tempting to attribute this   weaponization of “free speech” rhetoric to cynicism. More likely it’s cognitive dissonance.  When I speak to conservative groups that claim a commitment to free speech, they often seem genuinely surprised by data showing that campus illiberalism is not exclusively espoused by liberals. They’re apparently unaware that conservative students are also requesting “trigger warnings” (typically about nudity, sex and gay themes) according to a faculty survey released by the National Coalition Against Censorship. They also don’t seem to know that Republican undergrads are about as likely as their Democratic classmates to say that colleges should be able to restrict campus speech that expresses “political views that are upsetting or offensive to certain groups,” according to a Knight Foundation survey.  Beyond campus, Republicans more broadly are almost twice as likely as Democrats to support book bans.  Fighting perceived ideological repression with ideological repression is nothing new, of course. Earlier rounds of the campus culture wars had their own “most dangerous professors” lists. In fact, purges of professors suspected of endangering or brainwashing students date not only to McCarthyism, but also at least to World War I.  Likewise we’ve seen earlier   attempts to use state power to punish colleges for (supposed) liberal indoctrination of students.  Don’t get me wrong. Campuses probably need more intellectual diversity (especially from conservative thinkers) and definitely more public debate. But the principled way to achieve those ends is to actually have the debate. Not to shut it down.

142290,217712,The GOP coup in North Carolina previews what we’re going to see everywhere,Washington Post,Paul Waldman,2016-12-16,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161217000254/https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2016/12/16/the-gop-coup-in-north-carolina-previews-what-were-going-to-see-everywhere/
","     There’s a kind of coup going on in North Carolina, one that tells us a lot about just how far Republicans are willing to go to hold on to power and undercut Democrats. Here’s what’s happening: After a close election, Democrat Roy Cooper defeated Republican incumbent Pat McCrory to win the governorship. So the Republican state legislature decided to call an “emergency” session before Cooper takes office and strip the governor of as many powers as it could.  The bills Republicans are pushing through the legislature would, among other things, cut the number of appointments the governor can make by 80 percent; make his cabinet appointments subject to state senate confirmation; transfer authority for the state board of education from the governor to the superintendent (a Republican ousted a Democrat this year in the election for that seat); move the authority to appoint trustees of the University of North Carolina from the governor to the legislature; and dilute the governor’s control over the state board of elections and mandate that the board will be chaired by a Democrat in   years (when there are no elections) and a Republican in   years (when there are elections).   And they’re barely bothering to pretend that if a Republican governor is elected in four years they won’t just reverse most or all of these changes. This isn’t just hardball politics. This is a fundamentally   approach to government, one that says that when we win, we get to implement our agenda, and when you win, you don’t.  To put this in context, perhaps nowhere in the country have Republicans moved more aggressively to solidify power by disenfranchising their opponents as they have in North Carolina. Immediately after the Supreme Court gutted the Voting Rights Act in 2013, Republicans enacted a voter suppression law that “targeted African Americans with almost surgical precision,” in the words of the appeals court that later struck it down. The district lines already give the Republicans an enormous advantage: In 2016, Republicans outpolled Democrats in North Carolina congressional races by a margin of only   yet they held 10 of the state’s 13 congressional seats. The situation in the state house is similar: In this closely divided swing state, Republicans enjoy supermajorities in both houses of the state legislature because of aggressively gerrymandered legislative districts that pack   together in order to dilute their power. The districts were declared unconstitutional by a federal court earlier this year, and the state has been ordered to redraw them and hold special elections next year. But in the meantime, in this year’s election Republicans won 56 percent of votes to the state senate, yet controlled 35 of the chamber’s 50 seats. In the state house the results were similar: Republicans won 53 percent of the votes, yet hold 74 of the 120 seats.  That isn’t to say there aren’t places where Democrats try to use gerrymandering to their advantage, too. But there’s a shamelessness to the way Republicans change rules, trample over   norms, and generally act as though any result except one in which they win is inherently illegitimate. And that’s the fundamental principle that guides them. As far as they’re concerned, Democratic votes are not real votes and therefore can and should be suppressed; elections in which Democrats win can only have been stolen; and elected Democrats are usurpers against whom no tactic of subversion is out of bounds.  I can already hear Republicans protesting, “What about all that faithless elector stuff? Huh? Huh?” My answer is: give me a break. The effort to get members of the Electoral College to change their votes to someone other than Donald Trump is halfhearted at best, and most Democratic elites have either rejected it outright or said it should go forward as nothing more than a symbolic expression of dissent and not a practical effort to actually overturn the results of the election. Nobody genuinely thinks it’s going to succeed as anything more than a statement. Meanwhile, I can’t think of a single Republican who has raised any objection to the kind of vote suppression the party has embraced as a means to win more elections, and the party’s leader is out literally celebrating low turnout among   to the cheers of his crowds. Ask yourself: What would be happening right now if Donald Trump had won more than three million more votes than Hillary Clinton, but Clinton prevailed in the Electoral College? Would he, his supporters, and prominent Republicans have said, “We don’t like the outcome, but that’s how the system works”? Of course not. They’d be screaming bloody murder, they’d be preparing articles of impeachment to file on the day Clinton was inaugurated, they’d be charging that the vote was stolen, they’d be filing lawsuits to overturn (not just recount) the results in every swing state, and Trump would be telling his supporters to use any means necessary to achieve justice. You think we’re divided now? If the situation was reversed we’d be on our way to civil war. In the next few years, Democrats are going to be up against versions of the North Carolina model in every state where Republicans have power and at the national level as well: efforts not just to implement Republican policy goals but to change the rules to make it as difficult as possible for Democrats to win. It has already been happening for a while, and it’s only going to accelerate.  "

","     MARRAKESH, Morocco  —     Donald Trump’s kind words and admiration for Russian President Vladimir Putin seem painfully naive. Moscow’s interference in the U. S. presidential elections makes their bromance even more unnerving. Yet Trump’s   posture is neither unprecedented nor likely to last very long. Kurt Volker and I were on one of those   sessions on Thursday at the German Marshall Fund’s “Atlantic Dialogues” conference in Marrakesh, Morocco, where great stuff is said because it is off the record. But the former U. S. ambassador to NATO and current executive director of the McCain Institute for International Leadership at Arizona State University gave such a simple explanation of the relationship between the United States and Russia that I asked him if he would tell me on the record. Volker obliged. Every president that I’ve had a chance to work with started their administration with some form of a reset. Whether it’s George H. W. Bush and not wanting to be triumphalist over the fall of the Soviet Union. We had Bill Clinton and the   Commission. We had Barack Obama doing the famous reset. George Bush, you remember, looked into [Putin’s] eyes in Slovenia. So, it’s no surprise that Donald Trump wants to start out doing a reset. The second thing is that every president has done this primarily because they think it was their predecessor that screwed things up. So they think, “Well, I can do a better job. I can handle this. I know these people. I can make this work. ” And it turns out that the problem isn’t actually their predecessor. The problem is the Russians.

Hof,2016-12-16,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161217000254/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/global-opinions/wp/2016/12/16/everyone-connected-with-the-abomination-in-aleppo-will-pay-a-heavy-price/
","     Frederic C. Hof is director of the Atlantic Council’s Rafik Hariri Center for the Middle East. He advised Hillary Clinton on Syria at the State Department in 2012.  Some 70 months ago, unarmed, ordinary Syrians rose peacefully against a regime whose incompetence and corruption they had come grudgingly to accept. It was their rulers’ detention and beating of children that provided the tipping point. The same regime seeks now to capitalize on a bloody victory in Aleppo, where children again have been targeted. But the actual and prospective costs associated with the deliberate slaughter of civilians in Aleppo and elsewhere in Syria are steep, and everyone connected with this abomination will pay, especially those who have stood by and watched. For Syrians hoping for a future free of the Assad family and entourage, the price of Aleppo is bitter. Prodded by a violent regime into armed resistance it did not want, undermined by   extremists and abandoned by   unwilling to match words with deeds, Syrian nationalists must now acknowledge that Syrian President Bashar  ’s survival strategy is working. That strategy is rooted in collective punishment. The regime, with the enthusiastic support of Russia and Iran, does not hesitate to kill, maim, terrorize and displace civilians in areas where rebel forces are present. Indeed, the Russian air force has demonstrated a special aptitude for destroying hospitals. For Assad and his allies, no atrocity is unthinkable. Nationalists opposing Assad must ask and answer some hard questions. Has armed resistance run its course? Would it be more humane to lay down arms in the hope that fewer people will be killed, maimed, tortured, starved and displaced than is currently the case? Should ending   terror from the skies and starvation sieges down below be the top priority? Given the carnage of Aleppo and all that has preceded it, there is no doubt about what the regime and its allies are willing to do. Neither can there be any doubt about the refusal of the West, notwithstanding its “Never Again” rhetoric, to offer a modicum of protection. That which today passes for “the West”  —   a hollow, demoralized, leaderless coalition of the frightened and unwilling  —   also faces a steep price. Having protected no Syrians from mass murder; having given Russia, the regime and Iran a green light to do as they wished by chanting endlessly about there being no “military solution” to the problem of Syria; having watched the Kremlin draw lessons from Syria to apply in Europe  —   where does it now end? With explicit surrender by offering to join forces with Russia, the regime and Iran in Syria? With implicit surrender by perpetuating the   model of soaring rhetoric combined with craven inaction? The price of Western surrender in Syria may prove in the end to be the undoing of European unity and the breaking of the transatlantic alliance. And yes, today’s victors face costs. Aleppo is but the latest Syrian crime scene where evidence of gross violations of international humanitarian law has been gathered and placed in safe hands. Obviously, there is no accountability today for those who target homes, hospitals, schools, marketplaces and humanitarian convoys. But the evidence will hang over the heads of the perpetrators so long as they breathe. Then there is the cost of material rebuilding. If Assad and his entourage continue to sit atop a shattered state, whose taxpayers will pour hundreds of billions of dollars into Syria? The regime itself may have little interest in reconstruction: a Levantine North Korea is probably good enough for the family. Will Moscow and Tehran be able to sustain someone content to roost atop the ruins? As matters now stand, to the victors belong the spoiled. Russia and Iran should budget for reconstruction so long as the corrupt Assad regime waits with its hands outstretched. For Syrians, the costs of Assad propped up are incalculable.  The United States and its coalition partners may eventually defeat the Islamic State in central and eastern Syria. But the collective punishment strategy of Assad and friends has been catnip and a recruiting gift for extremists, both in Syria and around the world. For Syrians, more than five years of trying to build civil society and   may, in the   be for naught. Their suffering  —   at home and in refugee camps  —   is far from over. Syria under Assad is Syria ruined. Perhaps a military solution of sorts for Syria is at hand after all. Among the casualties and costs are international humanitarian law and the reputations of those who have praised it in word and abandoned it in fact. U. N. Ambassador Samantha Power has, at the Security Council, equated Aleppo with Halabja, Rwanda and Srebrenica. Given the political costs to the West of a humanitarian catastrophe unopposed, she may as well have added Munich to her list.  Everyone will be paying for Aleppo for as far as the eye can see: Syrians and what remains of “the West” will be taxed at the highest rates."

","         DespiteÂ protests, widespread criticismÂ and a threat by the   to challenge in court any moves that he believes would unconstitutionally limit his power, the   North Carolina legislature has passedÂ changes that would severely limit the incoming Democratic governor’s power. The legislature approvedÂ a proposal along party lines Friday that would effectively give Republicans control of the state Board of Elections during election years and split partisan control of local boards of elections, as opposed to giving the governor s party the majorities on those panels. Â Outgoing Gov. Pat McCrory (R) Â signed the bill into law Friday, despite not issuing any comment on the drama wracking North Carolina politicsÂ sinceÂ Wednesday. The legislature also looks poised to pass, for the first time in decades, a law requiringÂ the governor to get approval by the state Senate for his Cabinet appointees and ending his ability to appoint members to the board of trustees of the powerful UNC school system. The bill would also drastically reduceÂ the number of state employees the governorÂ can directly hire and fire from 1, 500 to 425. The measures were just two of several bills the legislature consideredÂ in a     special session reducing the governor s influence in state government, the judicial branch, the education system and elections oversight, while strengthening the   legislature’s influence in all those areas. Immediate reaction to the special sessionÂ appeared sharply divided on partisan lines. Republican legislative leaders said the changesÂ were long overdue to realignÂ constitutional power in the legislature, though they admitted a Democrats’Â election had accelerated the timetable for the changes. Democratic lawmakers and activists derided their Republican colleagues’ attempts at aÂ  power grab ? and urged North Carolinians to come to Raleigh to protest. Nonpartisan watchdogs, like Bob Hall with Democracy North Carolina, said the changes go ”far beyond the normal partisan wrangling and change of power.” The timing in particular sparkedÂ widespread criticism that RepublicansÂ were playing politics after losing the governor’s election. Â Less than two weeks ago, McCrory conceded to Attorney General Roy Cooper (D) in the nation’s closest governor’s race of 2016. The Raleigh News & Observer reported hundreds of protesters heeded Democrats’Â callsÂ and packed the capitol on Thursday and, to a lesser degree, on Friday. Several times, police arrested protesters after they refused to stop booing, chanting and cheering from the public galleries while lawmakers debated the bills. A reporter for an advocacy group who was in the galleries claimed to have been arrested as well. Each time there was a disturbance, GOP lawmakers closed the public galleries, pointing to a live stream peopleÂ could watch instead.

In his waning hours in office, McCrory convened lawmakers inÂ Raleigh to pass a $200 million relief package for Hurricane Matthew and wildfire cleanup. Lawmakers passed the package, ended the special session Wednesday  ” then promptly started a new one and declined to say what it was about until the controversial bills were introduced. In a news conference Thursday with local reporters, Cooper told the legislature to  go home ? and warned they could be overstepping their bounds, politically if not constitutionally.  This is about thwarting the governor s ability to move us forward, ? he said, promising to sue lawmakers for passing any law he deemed unconstitutional.  Most people might think that this is a partisan power grab. But this is more ominous. ?    Gov.  Roy Cooper holds a news conference to criticize efforts by Republicans to cut the power of the governor’s office . (Chris   & Observer via AP)  It’s an open question what the courts will make of these changes, said UNC law professor Michael Gerhardt. It’s notable, he said, that McCrory never said over the last four years:  I think I’m too powerfulÂ and you should look for ways to weaken my office. ? The last time GOPÂ lawmakers called a   special session, in March, they ended up ramming through one of the state’s most controversial laws in recent memory: a bill limiting what public bathrooms transgender people can use and municipalities’ ability to pass   laws for LGBT people. National backlash to that bill contributed to McCrory’s upset. He was the only governor in 2016 to lose his seat and the only governor in North Carolina history to lose reelection. Â  (Notably, Republicans in the state legislature kept their supermajority in November.) Power    inÂ North CarolinaÂ aren’t unprecedented. InÂ 1972, when Jim Holshouser became the first Republican governor of North Carolina in the 20th century, Democrats in the legislature moved swiftly toÂ give theÂ Democratic lieutenant governor more control over the state. Â A decade later, the   legislature tried to roll back those powers afterÂ voters elected the state’s first lieutenant RepublicanÂ governor of theÂ 20th century. Republican Jim Martin was governor during that tumultuous time, yetÂ he toldÂ told the News & Observer he thinks his party’s proposal to take away the governor’s ability toÂ appoint members to the UNC board of trustees goes  too far. ? Indeed, the consensus in North Carolina political circles is that noÂ   attemptÂ has been asÂ brazen as this one. And it underscores how contentious relations between the governor and the legislature are expected to be next year. Cooper ousted McCrory by some 10, 000 votes out of more than 4 million cast, and Republicans in the state legislature can vetoÂ Cooper anytime they want. Before Cooper was even sworn in, they signaled they have little intention of playing nice with him. The message Friday was clear, Gerhardt said:  We have a legislature intent on keeping the score politically. ?"
142294,217716,Ivanka Trump could be the most powerful first lady ever,Washington Post,Kate Andersen Brower,2016-12-16,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161217000254/https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2016/12/16/ivanka-trump-could-be-the-most-powerful-first-lady-ever/
","     First ladies aren’t always presidential spouses. In fact, two early uses of the title refer to the beautiful, popular Harriet Lane, niece of James Buchanan, the only lifelong bachelor president. She was an able hostess who, not long before the Civil War, arranged for Northern and Southern guests to be seated apart at a White House function in order to keep the peace. Harper’s Weekly called her “Our Lady of the White House,” and Frank Leslie’s Illustrated Newspaper captioned Lane’s picture thusly: “The subject of our illustration   …     may be justly termed the first lady in the land. ” So as we learn that Ivanka Trump, Donald Trump’s older daughter, arranged a meeting between the   and former vice president Al Gore; that she and husband Jared Kushner are reportedly   in Washington; and that Ivanka is rumored to be looking at White House office space, it’s pretty fair to say she isn’t breaking completely new ground. There’s no job description, so like other first ladies, Ivanka can define her position  —   and it looks like the gig is hers  —   in a unique way: advocating for nonpartisan causes, as Laura Bush did with children’s literacy and Michelle Obama did with nutrition, or setting up in the White House’s West Wing as a de facto policy adviser, like Hillary Clinton. But unlike her predecessors who weren’t the wife of the president, Ivanka appears poised to be an adviser, advocate and hostess all at once. Which could revolutionize the role  —   and make her the most powerful first lady ever. [Trump is selling his supporters a glamorous life] “Ivanka and Jared and Don Jr. are more influential than any Cabinet member,” a friend of the Trumps told me recently, referring to the first daughter, her husband and her older brother. And given Ivanka’s enthusiasm on the campaign trail and her understanding of the ways of official Washington  —   in contrast to her stepmother’s apparent indifference  —   it’s not only conceivable that she’ll be the incoming administration’s titular first lady, she’ll redefine the position by expanding it in ways that will make it almost unrecognizable. When I interviewed Rosalynn Carter earlier this year, she clearly remembered the uproar over her decision to sit in on her husband’s Cabinet meetings, even though she did so without saying a word. Then, first ladies were expected to hide their influence. Ivanka, on the other hand, was at the table Wednesday (along with Don Jr. and brother Eric) when the   met with tech CEOs. And she hasn’t done much to dispel the notion that she and her husband will be top advisers, despite describing her role in the administration to “60 Minutes” reporter Leslie Stahl by saying, “I’m going to be a daughter. ”        Donald Trump’s oldest daughter, Ivanka, was often by his side on the campaign trail and could play an influential role in his administration. Here’s what you might not already know about her. (Sarah   Washington Post)   Throughout our nation’s history, nontraditional first families, with a president who had remarried, or with someone other than the president’s wife serving as first lady, were not as uncommon as they have been in recent years. In part, that’s because life expectancies used to be so much shorter. Martha Jefferson Randolph was first lady because her mother died nearly 20 years before her father, Thomas Jefferson, was inaugurated. Rose Cleveland was her brother Grover Cleveland’s first lady until his marriage to Frances Cleveland. In more recent times, filling in for the first lady hasn’t always been a coveted assignment:    Susan Ford stepped in temporarily, and reluctantly, during President Gerald Ford’s first diplomatic reception, when first lady Betty Ford was recovering from a mastectomy and couldn’t attend. A mix of daughters, nieces and sisters have held the position. But it has become increasingly unusual for a first daughter to take on more than a peripheral role in her father’s administration, and it has been a century since there was a first lady who was not the president’s wife. The last time it happened was in 1914, when President Woodrow Wilson’s wife died less than two years after his inauguration and their daughter, Margaret, became hostess until President Wilson married Edith Bolling Galt Wilson. Edith would become the most powerful first lady  —   seen almost as an acting president  —   after the president suffered a debilitating stroke in 1919, 18 months before he left the White House. Ivanka probably won’t wield that much unilateral clout, but the breadth of her involvement will be singular. There’s also precedent for reluctant first spouses. Jacqueline Kennedy depended on Lady Bird Johnson to fill in for her so often that Kennedy’s staff took to calling the   lady “Saint Bird. ” Bess Truman fled Washington to her home in Independence, Mo. as often as possible, but as wives of presidents, both she and Kennedy were still expected to make themselves available for state dinners, holiday celebrations and foreign trips. Melania Trump is a more exaggerated and, in a way, more transparent version of these women. Though Melania emerged occasionally during the campaign, she’s been almost invisible during the transition. Up to now, she’s not even made the pretense of moving into the White House, planning instead to remain at Trump Tower for at least the first several months of her husband’s administration.      Speaking at Trump Tower, Dec. 15,   Trump’s senior adviser and former campaign manager Kellyanne Conway had no announcements about Ivanka Trump and her husband Jared Kushner’s potential roles in the administration, but said ”we would benefit tremendously” from their contributions. (The Washington Post)   Ivanka, then, will start out as the most prominent woman in her father’s White House. And while I’m not sure she’ll always delight in playing hostess, I do think she is intrigued by the potential to serve as an envoy from President Trump to skeptical blue America. She has, after all, already brokered meetings between her father and Gore and Leonardo DiCaprio, two of the country’s most visible environmental activists. She was already a powerful voice in the campaign, and before that she was the most visible representative of the Trump brand, next to her father. She’s already participated in calls and meetings between Trump and heads of state, including Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Argentine President Mauricio Macri  —   signaling that her father trusts her diplomatic instincts, but also raising questions about conflicts of interest between her role as a member of the first family and her post in the Trump Organization, which has business dealings in both of those countries. One way to view Ivanka’s unapologetic assertion of herself as a policy adviser is that she’s already cleared the bar that Lady Bird warned her daughters about: “Don’t do anything you wouldn’t mind seeing on the front page of the newspaper. ” Ivanka has lived her whole life understanding this maxim and is prepared for the White House in a way that presidential daughters who came before her, including Luci and Lynda Bird Johnson, Tricia and Julie Nixon, and Jenna and Barbara Bush, weren’t. She always appears unflappably cool, calm and collected. And while it is nothing new for presidential children to give campaign speeches (Lyndon Johnson routinely graded his daughters’ speeches) it is rare to have a presidential daughter so eclipse the president’s wife. Melania made only two big speeches during the campaign  —   including her embarrassing remarks at the Republican National Convention when it appeared that she had cribbed from Michelle Obama’s 2008 Democratic National Convention speech. By contrast, Ivanka was a constant presence, traveling the country to places that wouldn’t automatically be seen as likely campaign stops for a glamorous New Yorker, avoiding major gaffes and being widely viewed by political observers as an asset to her father’s political operation. [Sexism did not cost Clinton the election] Other presidential daughters who’ve waded into politics have had to make tremendous personal sacrifices. As Vietnam War protests raged in the spring of 1970, the head of Julie Nixon’s Secret Service detail warned her against attending her own graduation from Smith College. She had been one of her father’s fiercest public defenders and in a   plea she wrote to her father’s adviser, John Ehrlichman: “I truly think the day will be a disaster if he comes. ” To wield the power she potentially could, Ivanka will need to have the same flexibility. During the campaign she unwisely cut short an interview with Cosmopolitan’s Prachi Gupta because she said the reporter’s questions about conflicts between her statements on child care and her father’s statements years before had “a lot of negativity. ” That’s an answer the media probably won’t accept from someone with West Wing influence. If Ivanka does move to Washington, she will soon learn why many first ladies found the White House confining, from Bess Truman (who called it the “great white jail”) to Michelle Obama, who once joked that the White House was like a “really nice prison. ” So maybe it’s best that Ivanka relishes her incredible position and at least clearly seems to want to be in Washington. When reporters tried to interview Truman, she replied, “You don’t need to know me. I’m only the president’s wife and the mother of his daughter. ” In a Washington Post interview in April,   Donald Trump described Melania’s reluctance: “We have such a great life. Why do you want to do this?” he said she asked him. He replied with his usual modesty: “I sort of have to do it, I think. I really have to do it. ” Ivanka doesn’t share her stepmother’s reticence. She fits the mold of Alice Roosevelt Longworth, President Theodore Roosevelt’s first daughter, who described herself as “ecstatic” when her father became the 26th president (leaving aside the reason for his sudden succession, President William McKinley’s assassination). Perhaps we should applaud a woman who wants to put her own stamp on a role that has continually evolved. Just as so many were anticipating Bill Clinton’s redefinition of the role of first spouse, maybe Ivanka will force a reconsideration of what being first lady means and who should fill that position. I think it should be someone who wants it, and who recognizes the incredible responsibility  —   and opportunity  —   that comes with the admittedly outdated moniker.

142295,217717,"Trump Grill’s star rating is plummeting, and Yelp is trying to save it from the trolls",Washington Post,Avi Selk,2016-12-16,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161217000254/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/food/wp/2016/12/16/trump-grills-star-rating-is-plummeting-and-yelp-is-trying-to-save-it-from-the-trolls/
","     The Vanity Fair review was bad enough. A chunk of decor fell on the magazine’s critic as she dined at Trump Grill, she wrote. The menus were misprinted, and the reviewer used the word “flaccid” twice in one sentence describing the Szechuan dumplings. As for the filet mignon, it “came out overcooked and mealy, with an ugly strain of pure fat running through it. . . . The steak slumped to the side over the potatoes like a dead body inside a   minivan. ” But the real damage to the reputation of   Donald Trump’s titular steakhouse may come not from the magazine, but the masses. The New York restaurant’s Yelp rating has lost an entire star since the Vanity Fair review published Wednesday afternoon and continues to suffer as a Twitter spat between Trump and the magazine keeps it in the news. The rating hovered just above 2 stars by lunchtime on Friday  —   and some of the new negative reviews looked fairly suspect. “I tried to get in but there was a giant wall around the building,” read one, posted on Thursday and appearing to describe the Mexican border Trump promised to fence off rather than Trump Tower, where the restaurant is housed. “I was asked to pay for the wall. So, I tried to pay with my WomanCard, but they wouldn’t accept it. ” Now Yelp itself is trying to rescue Trump Grill from the trolls, deleting reviews its employees think have less to do with the food than the furor around its namesake. The online review giant has tried to clean up skewed reviews before, including after a   driver turned away a Bernie Sanders supporter and reviews went viral. But Yelp’s relatively new “cleanup” program might face its biggest test with the attack on Trump Grill, which held a   rating before the political rise of its landlord.    Trump Tower Grille  —   also known as Trump Grill. (Jim     via Getty Images)  To be fair, it was Vanity Fair that first mixed food and politics. Sitting in an overflow table outside the restaurant, critic Tina Nguyen scorched the grill’s “  paintings,” the Ivanka’s Salad and a chocolate cake “that tastes like Tums. ” But Nguyen’s review also wondered what her dining experience “says about the Trump presidency. ” “Perhaps it’s a sign that Trump is in over his head,” she wrote, “and a shallow, mediocre man who runs a shallow, mediocre business empire. ” The review went viral on Wednesday. Trump, in typical style, responded the next morning in a tweet.   Has anyone looked at the really poor numbers of @VanityFair Magazine. Way down, big trouble, dead! Graydon Carter, no talent, will be out!  —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 15, 2016   The tweet led, inevitably, to more stories about the grill. And about Trump. A Los Angeles Times gossip column detailed a   old feud between Trump and Vanity Fair’s editor, Graydon Carter, over the   ’s allegedly short fingers. A Yelp graph plots the corresponding destruction. Trump Grill’s average rating had fallen one star in the weeks between Trump’s election and the Vanity Fair review. It has fallen another full star since, teetering near a rating of 2. 1 by  .    Trump Grill’s Yelp ratings, charted. (Yelp)  Vanity Fair had claimed Trump Grill “could be the worst restaurant in America,” and the public seemed to agree. But many of the new Yelp reviews seem to bend political. “First thing that hits you is the horrible decor,” reads one captured by Uproxx. “I guess you’d call it Trump Tacky. ” At some point on Thursday, as the grill’s Yelp star sank, a red box popped on the review page. An “Active Cleanup Alert. ” “This business recently made waves in the news, which often means that people come to this page to post their views on the news,” Yelp warned. “As a result, your posts to this page may be removed. ” A Yelp spokesman said the cleanup may not actually begin for a day or so, “because we sometimes receive hundreds and even thousands of photos and reviews in response to media attention. ” An executive explained the cleanup program’s purpose in October, after launching it last year. The online review giant’s vice president for corporate communication cited a pizza parlor owner who hugged President Obama in 2012, leading to “a mishmash of thousands of political viewpoints” on the review page. “Our goal is to be transparent with the actions we take to protect the quality of content on our site, preserve consumers’ freedom of speech, and shield businesses from online harassment,” the exec wrote in a blog post. It’s not clear how many other review pages are being scrubbed. But disclaimers that “this business is being monitored by Yelp’s Support team” still appear on the pages of those targeted by trolls in the past. One is Amyx Hardware, a Tennessee store that made national news last year after a “No Gays Allowed” sign was seen in its window. Today, the store’s page features four reviews, all for one star. “I found myself being badgered for being a woman with short hair and dressing ‘like a demon,’ ” one complains. That’s nothing compared to the wrath against Ken Shupe, a South Carolina   driver who told a local news station that he refused to tow a stranded driver with a Bernie Sanders bumper sticker this year. Shupe’s story went national. (“Why a   tow truck driver says he refused service to a Sanders supporter,” read a Washington Post headline.) A Google search shows that his company’s Yelp review fell to a single star in the aftermath, and the site now lists the business as “closed. ” Could the same fate befall Trump Grill, or can Yelp weed out the fake reviews from the real ones? The steak shop didn’t always face such existential questions. Its first Yelp review appeared in the early weeks of the Obama administration, when Trump was just a reality TV star with a catchphrase. “You’re Fired! hahaha,” Lynn N. from Oklahoma wrote in 2008, as she gave three stars to Trump Grill’s sorbet trio and brownie a la mode. “Both desserts were too expensive,” she wrote. “But c’mon . . . how many can say they ate at a ‘grill’ named after Trump! ?!” The answer, as Yelp now knows, is anyone who wants to."

142297,217719,It took three years for Yahoo to tell us about its latest breach. Why does it take so long?,Washington Post,Hayley Tsukayama,2016-12-16,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161217000254/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2016/12/16/it-took-three-years-for-yahoo-to-tell-us-about-its-latest-breach-why-does-it-take-so-long/
","     The scale of a second Yahoo breach disclosed on Wednesday was staggering, exposing information associated with a billion accounts. But, perhaps even more staggering was that the theft happened three years ago  —   and had not been reported until now. That probably left a lot of consumers wondering: Why does it take so long to find out that I’ve been hacked? In Yahoo’s case, the reason for the delay may be a fairly simple one. The company may not have known about the breach. Yahoo has not revealed how it learned about the 2013  attack, but reading between the lines of its announcement, it seems as though its security team was alerted by outside investigators rather than an internal team. ”[Law] enforcement provided us with data files that a third party claimed was Yahoo user data,” wrote Yahoo’s chief information security officer Bob Lord in a blog post. “We analyzed this data with the assistance of outside forensic experts and found that it appears to be Yahoo user data. ” But even when companies do find a breach on their own, there are other reasons their users may not hear about it right away. The laws around data breaches are complicated and each state has its own standards for when and how breaches must be reported, which can slow down the process. There has been a long political fight over how to streamline conflicts between those laws, but Congress hasn’t come to a conclusion yet. And as the debate rages on, consumers  —   who often have no idea that they should be protecting themselves against potential identification theft from hacks  —   are the ones who suffer.  On top of that, different types of information require different disclosures. Companies investigating hacks have to parse out whether financial, medical or other data has been taken and whether the theft of that information poses real harm to consumers. Sorting all of that can take time, particularly when individual states have different guidelines about who needs be notified about what, and when. And companies are often wary of   customers, for fear of brand damage or, conversely, that   consumers will ignore important messages. Plus, there are different notification laws in 47 states, plus D. C. and Puerto Rico, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. (The only three states that do not have data breach notification laws are Alabama, New Mexico and South Dakota.) Given that patchwork of laws, it can be hard for national companies to figure out what their duties to their customers are, particularly those based in a different state than the company’s headquarters. To solve those conflicts, there have been many pushes for a national data breach notification law that provides a baseline standard for when customers should learn about hacks. But settling on what should be included in a basic law is tricky. Privacy advocates  —   who generally favor stronger laws on data breach notification  —   raised concerns about a national data breach notification law proposed by President Barack Obama in 2015, worried that federal standards would override some of the more protective measures passed in individual states such as California.  Still, the latest Yahoo breach has renewed calls for companies to be better about notifying users when their information has been taken. “These revelations are deeply troubling,” said Sen. Mark R. Warner ( .) in an email to The Post. “If a breach occurs, consumers should not be first learning of it three years later. Prompt notification enables users to potentially limit the harm of a breach of this kind, particularly when it may have exposed authentication information such as security question answers they may have used on other sites. ” Lawmakers have suggested data breach laws be passed along with data security standards  —   measures designed to have companies such as Yahoo check their systems regularly for problems and head off more breaches in the first place. In New York, Attorney General Eric Schneiderman has been calling for the state to pass a law that requires companies to have “stronger technical and physical security measures” for their data. “This latest breach of Yahoo’s servers is a stark reminder that big data hacks are increasingly becoming the new normal,” Schneiderman said in a statement Thursday. “In light of that reality, I urge all New Yorkers to take essential steps to increase security of their personal information online and identify whether or not they’ve been the victim of identity theft. ” Information security experts have also recommended data breach notification laws to be considered together in congressional testimony. “The law should require, not just encourage, reasonable data security practices from companies that collect, process, and share personal information,” said law professor Woodrow Hartzog in a hearing in 2015. “This will fortify the protection of personal information in the United States and help ensure that fewer breach notifications need to be sent at all. ”"

"," Kim Jong Un stood on the stage in front of the stylized portraits of his father and grandfather, men he wasn’t supposed to be strong enough or cunning enough to succeed, lauding the “thrilling explosion” of the most recent nuclear test and the “leap forward in all sectors of the national economy. ” His   suit, his haircut, his glasses, even his gravelly voice were all reminiscent of his grandfather, Kim Il Sung, the founder and “eternal president” of North Korea who, to this day, remains associated with strength and prosperity. In front of him in the huge hall were 3, 467 delegates, called in May to the first congress of the ruling Workers’ Party since 1981, before Kim Jong Un was even born. Among them were   party stalwarts, the sort who had been expected by some analysts to turn against the inexperienced upstart when he first rose to the top. But there they were: men in military uniforms covered to the waist in medals, cheering party officials, scientists, the editor of the party newspaper,   revolutionary war veterans, field laborers. It was Kim’s moment. It was his way of saying, “I’m in charge here. ” And these were the people who were keeping him in power: the North Korean loyalists who, like Kim, have a vested interest in keeping the world’s most repressive regime intact. Their support is enabling Kim to celebrate his fifth anniversary as the leader of North Korea on Saturday, propelling the communist monarchy into its 71st year.      (Jason   Washington Post)   The Kim family has ruled the country through fear and favors since the end of World War II, when Kim Il Sung was chosen by Joseph Stalin to run it as a Soviet client state. His son, Kim Jong Il, continued the family rule for 17 years, until his death five years ago Saturday at age 69. The founder’s grandson, Kim Jong Un, was then anointed as “The Great Successor” in a country where the Kim family is deified and its supporters live large, while the remaining   million North Koreans struggle to feed their families and heat their shabby homes. During the transition, plenty of people who make a living studying North Korea from abroad predicted the system’s demise, doubtful that a   Chicago Bulls fan with no military background and none of the revolutionary myth of his forebears could retain control of a country run by   octogenarians. But he has. Five years on, the Kim regime has not just held together, it is relatively strong.  The economy has been growing, if not booming. It has functioning nuclear weapons and is making rapid progress toward being able to deliver them to the continental United States. Kim has given his closest ally, Chinese President Xi Jinping, the cold shoulder and suffered little for it. He has threatened to attack the United States and has actually attacked South Korea, but the sanctions imposed as punishment have fallen well short of fatal. “He has been a good dictator in the sense that he has behaved in accordance with the rules,” said Bruce Bueno de Mesquita, a political scientist at New York University who described the way authoritarian leaders around the world retain power in his book, “The Dictator’s Handbook: Why Bad Behavior is Almost Always Good Politics. ” “He has governed through corruption and   and keeping the population miserable. ” And there’s no reason to expect Kim to be going anywhere soon, Bueno de Mesquita said. If they survive the first two years, most dictators die in their sleep. Ken Gause, a North Korea leadership expert at CNA, a research company in Arlington, Va. agreed that Kim seems firmly in control  —   at least for now. “You have a leader who is becoming more comfortable in his own skin and is able to delegate and manipulate the levers of power in a much more sophisticated way,” Gause said. “I would say he is still working on building and solidifying his power. But for all intents and purposes, he is the leader in every sense of the word. ” Keeping ‘the loyalists loyal’ For kleptocratic dictators the world over, the key to staying in power is keeping the elite happy and rivals scared. Nowhere is this the case more than in North Korea. Kim has retained power by relying on a relatively small group  —   perhaps a couple of hundred military officials, Politburo members and    —   who also have an interest in keeping him at the helm. When he convened the congress in May, he put more of his core supporters into positions of power. Regimes such as this stay intact by spending money on the military and the apparatchiks instead of on the masses. “He’s paying the people who keep him in office enough so they won’t defect to anyone else,” Bueno de Mesquita said. “He needs to keep the loyalists loyal. ” And for the loyalists of Pyongyang, life is the best in decades. There are new   apartment buildings popping up everywhere, although the lower floors are most desired since there isn’t enough electricity to power the elevators. There’s a pizza restaurant in the city and a German beer hall, amusement parks and swimming pools. Supermarkets stock Japanese mayonnaise and French wine. Taxis are everywhere. With money, anything is possible. And increasingly, people have money.  Once reliant entirely on the state, North Koreans have been increasingly allowed to operate in capitalist ways. Factory managers and   farmers have more freedom to innovate, as long as they meet their state quotas, and private trade in everything from television sets to chewing gum is now tolerated. A recent study from Seoul’s Korea Institute for National Unification estimated that the North Korean government collects between $13 million and $17 million each day in fees from market traders. A new class of donju, or “masters of money,” has emerged in this space between state and private activity, using their positions in the regime  —   many travel to the outside world, where they can trade  —   to enrich their leader and themselves. But while tinkering at the margins, Kim has operated very much according to the playbook written by his grandfather. He has elevated the standing of the Workers’ Party and emphasized economic development, both of which under his father had been subordinated to the military and nuclear weapons. There is no doubt that the economy is a shadow of what it could be. State factories remain stuck in the Soviet era, if they are operating at all. Tough multilateral and direct sanctions imposed after nuclear and missile tests are biting. Those sanctions threaten the foreign currency earnings that Kim needs to continue underwriting the lifestyles of the North Korean upper crust and keeping them happy. But the country is still in the best economic shape in decades, with growth of about 2 or 3 percent, according to private sector analysts, much better than in the years of contraction under his father. If Kim, who turns 33 on Jan. 8, maintains the support of North Korea’s top tier, he could remain in power for decades to come, said Sue Mi Terry, a former North Korea analyst at the CIA. “The junior Kim has already ruled for five years and could conceivably rule for another 50 years,” she said, “if he maintains the support of North Korea’s elites, ‘the shareholders’ in his regime. ”  But there will be challenges. “While the elites as a group by and large still support him, there are signs of growing discord among the ruling class as it struggles for power and influence,” Terry said, noting that there have been several   defections from the regime this year. But Kim doesn’t just use money to curry favor; he uses   purges to instill fear. Since he took power, at least 100   officials have been purged or executed. Most notably, he had his own uncle, Jang Song Thaek, hauled out of a meeting at the end of 2013  —   broadcast on television  —   and denounced as a “traitor for all ages,” then killed. “The elites know that if Kim can turn on his uncle and other   officers like he did, any of them could be next in his gun sights,” Terry said. Cheong Seong Chang, a leadership expert at the Sejong Institute outside Seoul, said the purges were a sign of Kim’s strength. “If Kim Jong Un’s power base was weak, it would have been risky to execute these   officials,” he said, noting that the younger Kim executed many fewer people than his father did  —   about 2, 000  —   during his own transition period. “These executions show that he has absolute power. ” ‘Charming and gregarious’ For one of the world’s most threatening figures, very little is known about Kim as a person. Intelligence from inside the isolated state is notoriously thin, and only a handful of outsiders have even met him. The only Americans to have spent any time with him are Dennis Rodman, the former Chicago Bulls basketball player who visited the country three times, and his entourage. Joe Terwilliger, a New York geneticist who accompanied Rodman on two of his trips, said Kim is very different in person from the outside world’s caricature of him. “He’s charming and gregarious, and very friendly. He told a lot of jokes, and we had open conversations about every imaginable topic, like hanging out with old friends,” said Terwilliger, who went   with Kim at his summer house and sang karaoke in front of him. “He especially likes sports, music and movies, and even asked about Sylvester Stallone. ”  Since taking over, Kim has cultivated an image as a man of the people. He’s gone on rides at one of Pyongyang’s new amusement parks. Unlike his father, who never appeared in public with any of his wives, Kim is often accompanied by his fashionable spouse, Ri Sol Ju. Kim and Ri, who are believed to have two or three young children, have visited Pyongyang residents in their apartments, sitting on the floor with them. Kim has even poured drinks for his hosts  —   a humble gesture in a culture that prizes seniority and protocol. State media shows Kim with a much smaller retinue than his father had, and he is tactile, often slapping backs and clasping hands, a huge smile on his face. Experts have been trying to psychoanalyze North Korea’s leaders for decades, but it’s hard given how few clues there are. The popular view is of a   madman, but such mockery risks underestimating Kim. “People like him are not crazy, and they are not erratic,” said Bueno de Mesquita, the NYU political scientist. “They are carefully calculating. ” But, given Kim’s capacity for brutality, his short temper and his apparently impulsive tendencies, there is reason to be concerned about   said Jerrold Post, a psychiatrist who founded the CIA’s personality analysis center. “This is all about big boys and their big toys,” Post said. “I must say I’m concerned about words leading to actions between him and President Trump. ” Indeed, Kim has proven to be quick to escalate tensions, as in summer 2015, when a confrontation with South Korea over a   attack brought the two countries to the brink of war. The next two or three years will be critical for Kim, analysts say, as he solidifies his control and confronts the unconventional Donald Trump administration. But if the past is any guide, it would be prudent to avoid making predictions about the North Korea regime’s imminent demise. “There has been a lot of wishful thinking going on since the 1990s,” said Gause of CNA. “I’m not saying that their days are not numbered, but North Korea is a very resilient country. You can’t go on expecting the Kim family to crumble. ”  Yoonjung Seo contributed to this report.       "

","     Both President Obama and   Donald Trump believe the United States never should have invaded Iraq in 2o03 (or, at least, Trump claims he now does). The war in Iraq and its chaotic aftermath in many ways prefigure the present moment in the Middle East; it triggered a sectarian unraveling that now haunts both Iraq and Syria and looms large in the minds of an Obama administration wary of further intervention in the region’s conflicts. In a new book coming out this month, John Nixon, a former CIA officer who interrogated Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein after he was captured by coalition forces in December 2003, details his encounter with the toppled despot and the varied discussions that followed. Early on, Hussein warned that the occupation of Iraq wouldn’t be as much of a ”cakewalk” as Washington’s neoconservatives assumed at the time. From an excerpt published on Time magazine’s website: When I interrogated Saddam, he told me: “You are going to fail. You are going to find that it is not so easy to govern Iraq. ” When I told him I was curious why he felt that way, he replied: “You are going to fail in Iraq because you do not know the language, the history, and you do not understand the Arab mind. ” Nixon now reckons Hussein had a point and that a ruthless strongman like him was necessary to ”maintain Iraq’s   state” and keep both Sunni extremism and the power of   Iran, a Hussein foe, at bay. ”Saddam’s leadership style and penchant for brutality were among the many faults of his regime, but he could be ruthlessly decisive when he felt his power base was threatened, and it is far from certain that his regime would have been overthrown by a movement of popular discontent,” he wrote. ”Likewise, it is improbable that a group like ISIS would have been able to enjoy the kind of success under his repressive regime that they have had under the   Baghdad government.” (ISIS is another name for the Islamic State.) This may all be rather true. Trump himself insists that regime change should no longer be in Washington’s interest and has embraced dictatorial leaders such as Egypt’s President Abdel Fatah  . ”Although I found Saddam to be thoroughly unlikeable, I came away with a grudging respect for how he was able to maintain the Iraqi nation as a whole for as long as he did,” wrote Nixon. ”He told me once, ’Before me, there was only bickering and arguing. I ended all that and made people agree! ’” Many Arab commentators, though, reject the simplicity of the assumptions here  —   that if not ruled by tyrants, their nations would automatically turn into breeding grounds for militancy. That’s a logic, after all, that serves the autocrats.

","        Herders select and sort reindeer inside the enclosure. (Sergei  )  In about a week, children across America will be staring at the sky in hopes of catching a glimpse of Rudolph or one of his reindeer friends. But for the people snuggled in Russia’s remote Arctic regions there are usually so many reindeer  —   an estimated 730, 000  —   that for centuries people have had to herd these creatures to keep the population manageable. That said, 2016 has not been a good year for reindeer in the Nenets Autonomous District, a  subdivision of Siberia made up mostly of flat,   tundra, that is the size of California, Texas, Montana and both Dakotas combined. In August, a lighting strike killed a few hundred; a few thousand more were killed by anthrax  —   a result of the region’s soaring temperature; and in October, Russia proposed killing a   to prevent the anthrax outbreak from spreading. But for the village of Krasnoye, the only settlement in the Nenets region connected by road to the region’s capital, the herding tradition lives on. Igor Ledkov, who works at the Harp agricultural cooperative in Krasnoye, told Reuters photographer Sergei Karpukhin, who photographed the practice last month, “this year we plan to cull more than 3, 000 reindeer. ” Ledkov said the herders try to ensure the population doesn’t exceed 17, 000. Although Karpukhin’s stunning and spirited images capture the art and craft of reindeer culling, he isn’t the first photographer to document the ritual. The Washington Post featured Sebastiao Salgado’s stark black and white images four years ago. A lot has changed, but much has remained the same.

"," Pressure on members of the country’s electoral college to select someone other than Donald Trump has grown dramatically  —   and noisily  —   in recent weeks, causing some to waver, but yielding little evidence Trump will fall short when electors convene in most state capitals Monday to cast their votes. Carole Joyce of Arizona expected her role as a GOP elector to be pretty simple: She would meet the others in Phoenix and carry out a vote for Trump, who won the most votes in her state and whom she personally supported. But then came the mail and the emails and the phone calls  —   first hundreds, then thousands of voters worrying Trump’s impulsive nature would lead the country into another war. “Honestly, it had an impact,” said Joyce, a    Republican state committeewoman. “I’ve seen enough funerals. I’m tired of hearing bagpipes. . . . But I signed a loyalty pledge. And that matters. ” Such is the life these days for many of the 538 men and women who are scheduled to meet Monday across the country to carry out what has traditionally been a perfunctory vote after most every presidential election.   In this image from video, Electoral College voter Jim Skaggs looks through his mail from people writing him about being an elector in Bowling Green, Ky. (Dylan  )  The role of elector has intensified this year, in the wake of a bitter election in which Trump lost the popular vote by a margin of nearly 3  million and a secret CIA assessment revealed that Russia interfered to help Trump get elected. Amid the uncertainty caused by Russian influence, 10 electors  —   nine Democrats and one Republican  —   asked for an intelligence briefing to get more information about Moscow’s role. Their request was endorsed by John Podesta, Hillary Clinton’s campaign manager. “The administration should brief members of the electoral college on the extent and manner of Russia’s interference in our election before they vote on Dec. 19,” Podesta wrote Thursday in a Washington Post  .  The Office of the Director of National Intelligence said Friday evening that it would not brief the electors, because it is engaged in a presidentially ordered review of the Russian interference. “Once the review is complete in the coming weeks, the intelligence community stands ready to brief Congress” and may release findings, the ODNI said in a statement posted to its website. Meanwhile, Joyce and the other 305 Republican electors who are supposed to cast their votes for Trump have been subject to intense campaigns orchestrated by   forces to convince them that they alone can block the reality television star from the White House. Others have targeted Democratic electors, who are supposed to cast votes for Hillary Clinton, to persuade them to switch to a more conventional Republican who could also draw enough support from GOP electors to swoop into office. While there is little sign the efforts will prove successful, the push has unleashed intense pressure on individual electors, who have now been thrust into a sometimes uncomfortable spotlight.   Rex Teter, 59, a music teacher and preacher, received about 35, 000 emails and 200 letters urging him not to support Donald Trump. (David J.  )  Joyce has received emails from “Benjamin Franklin” and “John Jay”  —   and a Christmas card that read: “Please, in the name of God, don’t vote for Trump. ” The rancor about the role of electors started early in the campaign. In August, Baoky Vu, a GOP activist in Atlanta, said he planned to resign from the job because he was so morally opposed to Trump. He planned to defer his voting responsibility to someone more willing  —   an alternate who would be put in place Monday. After the election, Vu started getting phone calls and emails asking him not to resign. He was asked instead to consider joining a coalition of electors hoping to vote against Trump. He declined. “I don’t think we should drag this election out any longer,” Vu said. “And can you imagine if the electors overturned the results? If we attempt to change them in anyway, you’ve got these   elements that are just going to go haywire. ” Mark Hersch, a      marketing strategist, joined a group known as the Hamilton Electors, who have been organizing efforts to contact electors and change their minds. Before the election, Hersch said, the most political activism he had ever undertaken was planting a yard sign. He said he believes the goal to deny Trump seems reachable if not probable. Rather than persuade an entire country, he and his allies must find 37 Republicans willing to vote for someone else, a tipping point at which the responsibility of picking the president would shift to the U. S. House of Representatives. No one knows for sure how many are considering alternate votes; estimates vary from one to 25. The   House could vote for Trump anyway, but those trying to flip voters say there is still value in taking a stand. Hersch said he was inspired to continue to flip electors by the movie “300,” which depicts ancient Sparta’s war against a Persian army that outnumbered them 1, 000 to one. “I would like to think we would be successful, but if not, we need to do all we could to prevent this man from being president,” he said. Then he modified a line from the movie: “Prepare your breakfast, and eat hearty, for tonight, we will go to battle. This isn’t 300, but 538. ” That “battle” has intensified as electors draw closer to their convening Monday. Joyce was getting 15 letters a day and 300 emails in the days after Nov. 8, but those numbers quickly increased to 50 and 3, 000. Some of them have been form letters, others handwritten. The letters came from Washington state and from China, stuffed with copies of the U. S. Constitution or Alexander Hamilton’s writing in Federalist Paper No. 68, which states that the meeting of the electoral college “affords a moral certainty, that the office of President will never fall to the lot of any man who is not in an eminent degree endowed with the requisite qualifications. ” On Thursday, Joyce received so many letters that the letter carrier just gave her a U. S. Postal Service bucket filled to the brim. “I’m sorry this is happening to you,” Joyce recalled the letter carrier saying in a phone interview. While some electors have complained of harassment, Joyce shrugged off the mail and placed it all on a sofa decorated with American flag pillows. “This is America,” she said, adding that most of the messages were thoughtful. “People have a right to say what they want. ” On Friday, she said, her emails became more positive. The messages were from Republicans, thanking her for taking Trump to the finish line of an arduous process. “How refreshing!” she said. Although some Democrats (who have in the past five elections lost two in which they won the popular vote) and even Trump himself have questioned the necessity of the electoral college, many opposing Trump have said this election proves just how important it is. Norman Eisen, a former ambassador to the Czech Republic who served as legal counsel to both the Bush and Obama administrations, began telephoning electors to explain that their job is not necessarily to certify the results, but to have a reasonable discussion over whether the public made the right decision. For instance, Eisen, who focused on government ethics in Obama’s White House, noted that Trump could be violating a clause in the Constitution that prevents presidents from receiving gifts and funds from foreign governments; it is unclear whether his businesses do because he has not publicly disclosed his tax returns.     In Massachusetts, Republican operative and attorney R. J. Lyman said he didn’t want to harass anyone, so he used his connections to find electors who were willing to chat about the lessons he learned in American history class and at the dinner table. He became one of the few people in America more willing to talk about Hamilton the man than about “Hamilton: An American Musical. ”  The electoral college, he said he tells them, was “not intended to be a rubber stamp. ” Otherwise, he said, the Founding Fathers would have tasked the responsibility to a clerk or simply used the popular vote as a way of choosing a president. “I’m reminding them of their duty to think about their choice in a way that’s consistent with their conscience and the Constitution,” Lyman said. So far, Lyman said, he has identified 20 electors who might be willing to vote “other than their party pledge. ” He couldn’t name more than one publicly but insisted that more were out there. Earlier this month, Chris Suprun of Texas became the first Republican elector in a red state that voted for Trump to declare, in a Dec. 5 New York Times column, that he would not cast his electoral vote for Trump. Suprun voted for Cruz in the primary and said he left behind his wallet on Election Day and thus did not vote in the general. Nonetheless, Suprun said, he was willing to vote for Trump in the electoral college until the candidate claimed with no evidence that millions of Clinton supporters voted illegally. Suprun’s public stance has elicited death threats and hate mail, he said. “As of yesterday, people are calling to say, ‘Get your ass together, or we’re coming for you,’ ” said Suprun, who was the sole Republican elector to ask for an intelligence briefing on Russia. “They are doing it with their own phone number, not even blocking the number. That’s not been surprising  —   look at what Trump says himself. ” Vinz Koller, a Democratic elector from Monterey County, Calif. said he read Suprun’s column and started thinking about his own role in the college. It inspired him to support a new theory: If he could persuade other Democrats to abandon their Clinton votes, perhaps he and Republicans could agree on a more conventional choice  —   a la Ohio governor and failed candidate John Kasich  —   to vote for over Trump. The plan seemed unlikely, he said, but Trump’s candidacy unsettled him so much that he felt he needed to try anything. California is one of 29 states that mandate electors vote for the candidate who won the state, so Koller sued them to continue his plan. “Frankly, this is hard and not something I do lightly,” he said. “I’ve been working in partisan politics a long time, and I don’t like voting against my candidate, but I never thought that the country might be unstable until now. ” On Thursday evening, he found himself in the Library of Congress. Strolling through its stacks, Koller sought a librarian with one request: Can I see the original Federalist Papers? He looked to see Federalist No. 68, written by Hamilton to describe the need for the electoral college. “We have been getting a civic lesson we weren’t prepared to get,” Koller said. “They gave us the   emergency brake, in case the people got it wrong. And here we are, 200 years later. It’s the last shot we have. ”  Ellen Nakashima contributed to this report.  "
142302,217728,Trump is stoking his base on his pre-inaugural tour. But is he building bridges?,Washington Post,Philip Rucker,2016-12-17,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161218010609/https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-is-stoking-his-base-on-his-pre-inaugural-tour-but-is-he-building-bridges/2016/12/17/a74a0f0a-c3ad-11e6-8422-eac61c0ef74d_story.html
","  MOBILE, Ala.  —   He strode out on a catwalk at a football stadium here to Lynyrd Skynyrd’s “Sweet Home Alabama. ” A   cedar tree, which aides installed behind his stage with a crane, was decorated in Christmas ornaments larger than a human head. His crowd, thousands deep, held up familiar signs (“Make America Great Again”) and reprised signature chants (“Lock her up! ”). “This is where it all began,”   Donald Trump exhorted, basking in the adulation of the Alabamans who had come to see him Saturday afternoon in the same stadium where 16 months earlier he staged the first electric   of his improbable campaign. This city in the nation’s Bible Belt was the symbolic last stop in Trump’s journey to the White House  —   the conclusion of a     road show. Rather than projecting inclusivity and striving to heal the wounds from the bitter election, as past   have done, Trump has traveled on his “USA Thank You Tour” only to states he turned red on election night. He has whipped up his massive crowds, and they in turn have displayed their allegiance  —   a powerful reminder to members of Congress that it would be politically dangerous to cross him. “It’s a movement,” Trump declared in Mobile. “Don’t forget, they didn’t know you existed until Election Day  —   and then they said, ‘Where the hell did all those people come from?’ ”     As Trump assembles his administration and prepares to govern, Trump has continued the divisive rhetoric and showmanship of his campaign. He has mocked his opponents, sneered at the media and trumpeted his electoral feats. To the nearly 54 percent of voters who cast ballots for someone else, Trump’s message has been, in short: get on board or get left behind. Trump’s tone in the   to his Jan. 20 inauguration poses a challenge as he seeks to govern a deeply divided nation and build popular support for his policies. And as he tries to pivot from a rollicking campaign, Trump is struggling to tame the army of passionate followers he has playfully called “wild beasts. ” Trump’s “thank you” rallies have been an extension of those he held as a candidate  —   from the soundtrack (Elton John and Rolling Stones classics) to the vows from the lectern (“We will build a great wall! ”). Lately, Trump’s stages have been set with Christmas trees  —   16 of them at the Orlando stop  —   as a sparkling reminder that as president he would say “Merry Christmas,” and not simply “Happy Holidays. ” He has made no mention of Hanukkah or acknowledged other faiths. And in Mobile, he was introduced by evangelist Franklin Graham, who said Trump was elected by a spiritual force: “I believe it was God. ” When Trump swooped into Orlando for a Friday night rally, it had been 38 days since he had had to worry about Hillary Clinton. But his crowd was fixated on her. They chanted, “Lock her up! Lock her up!” To them, this was still a campaign, and Clinton was the enemy. Trump told them that in the   to the election, “You people were vicious, violent, screaming, ‘Where’s the wall?’ ‘We want the wall!’ Screaming, ‘Prison!’ ‘Prison!’ ‘Lock her up!’ I mean, you were going crazy. You were nasty and mean and vicious. ”       (Jayne   Washington Post)   But the campaign is now over, he said. Victory is in hand. The inauguration is a month away. And Trump tried to imagine for his fans how they ought to behave: “Now you’re laid back, you’re cool, you’re mellow, right?” Wrong.  Trump himself has hardly been a model of mellowness. He has used his tour stops to settle scores  —   with Evan McMullin, the Republican who waged an independent campaign against him in Utah; Ohio Gov. John Kasich (R) who resisted Trump’s candidacy; CNN’s John King, who in nightly   analyses on the “magic wall” predicted that Trump would not reach 270 electoral votes; and the media generally, which he faulted for “dishonest” polls. Even as Trump’s supporters have delighted in the  ’s stump routine, they have confessed in interviews that they wish he would adopt a more serious demeanor as he readies to enter the White House. “Sometimes, during this campaign, he was a little lippy on the mouth. I think it would be better if he toned it down, and I think he will,” said Craig Harrison, 45, a construction worker who showed up at Trump’s first tour stop in Cincinnati with a flag draped around his shoulders that was emblazoned with Trump’s slogan. Harrison said his friends called him “Super Trump. ”  Trump’s   posture is unlike any previous   historians said.  “I’ve never seen a president that continues to campaign instead of reaching out to voters that didn’t like him,” said Douglas Brinkley, a presidential historian at Rice University. “He’s shunning Hillary Clinton’s supporters and almost acting like they don’t matter. . . . I think he sees himself as a revolutionary figure, and you’re either going to join the Trump revolution or you’re not. ” Trump’s foot soldiers hope he continues   rallies as president. “He has to keep an open line to the people,” said Sue Anne Balch, 61, an immigration lawyer in Alabama. “I know how it is. You catch Potomac fever and forget everything. ” Trump agrees. “They’re saying, ‘As president, he shouldn’t be doing rallies.’ But I think we should, right? We’ve done everything else the opposite. This is the way you get an honest word out,” he said in Mobile. Trump’s Cabinet picks have tilted heavily conservative, and so far he has eschewed a tradition of tapping a member of the opposing party for a key post. He continues to use Twitter to whip up his base, with tweets opposing flag burning and suggesting, without evidence, that Clinton benefited from illegal votes. All nine of the stops on Trump’s “thank you” tour have been in states he won  —   some of them unexpectedly. The crowds have been overwhelmingly white and, by all accounts, mostly people who voted for him. Folks have come wearing Trump hats and  . Women have been given pink “Women for Trump” signs to wave. And when speakers have asked for a show of hands of who had been to a Trump rally before, it has seemed as if every hand were in the air. Sen. Bernie Sanders ( .) who ran unsuccessfully for president this year as a Democrat, said, “Mr. Trump has every right in the world to thank his supporters in those states in which he won but, as the   he also has the responsibility to assure all Americans that he is listening to their concerns. ” To be sure, Trump is making other moves to reach out to  . The eclectic group of people who have paraded through Trump Tower in New York to meet with the   have included some prominent Democrats, including former vice president Al Gore, Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel and New York Mayor Bill de Blasio. A group of technology company executives met with Trump and his top advisers last week, even though Silicon Valley was considered especially hostile to his candidacy.  Trump’s approach, different as it may be from his predecessors, appears to be no less strategic. Republicans have the majority in both chambers of Congress, and by keeping his base of supporters aroused, Trump is reminding them that there are risks should they vote against his nominees or his agenda. “He wants these voters to be heard loud and clear by Congress,” said Mary Anne Marsh, a Democratic consultant. “This is less of a   tour and more of a     tour. ” Seeking to build momentum for Trump’s agenda, the   and his advisers boast of a historic electoral college landslide. But Trump ranks just 46th out of 58 electoral college results, and a shift of some 40, 000 votes in three states would have cost him the presidency. He lost the popular vote to Clinton by more than 2. 8 million. Although Trump’s favorability ratings have improved since last month’s election, he has not yet experienced the honeymoon of popularity enjoyed by other  . Americans are evenly split on Trump’s transition so far, with 48 percent approving and 48 percent disapproving, according to a Gallup poll last week. That compares to overwhelming positive attitudes from the public for the presidential transitions of Barack Obama, George W. Bush and Bill Clinton, as recorded in past Gallup surveys. At a time when Trump is holding no press conferences, the rallies have allowed him to communicate directly with the public, bypassing the media  —   something many of his supporters say is important. “I know they lie,” said Freddie Killian, 60, an administrative assistant, who cheered on Trump in Alabama. “You want to hear the truth? Come out here and listen to him. ” Don Huyvaert, a retired federal government financial analyst, said he showed up at the Wisconsin stop to let Trump knows he has his back. “He’s going to have his hands full draining the swamp, but this tells him there are a lot of people out here behind him,” said Huyvaert, 66, a resident of nearby Mount Pleasant. At the end of his speeches  —   after the teasing and taunting, after the Christmas greetings, after the cries in the crowd to jail Clinton  —   Trump has looked ahead to life as the president and tried to cast himself as a unifying figure. His crowds may have been the white voters of red America, but the   has declared, as he did Thursday night in Hershey, Pa. that his message is for Americans “from all parties, all beliefs, all walks of life. ” “Whether you are African American, Hispanic American or Asian American or whatever the hell you are, remember that we are all Americans and we are all united by one shared destiny,” Trump said. “So I’m asking everyone to join this incredible movement. ”  Rucker reported from Mobile and Orlando; Wagner reported from Cincinnati, West Allis, Wis. and Hershey, Pa.

"," Presidents often are tested early, by unexpected crises or provocations by foreign adversaries.   Donald Trump’s first test has come even before he is sworn in, and so far, he has responded with denial, equivocation and deflection. The test has come over Russia’s brazen intrusion into the U. S. election process through its hacking of the servers at the Democratic National Committee and the email account of John Podesta, Hillary Clinton’s campaign manager. Contrary to what Trump said this week, the Russian intrusion was known long before the election. The Washington Post’s Ellen Nakashima reported in June that the Russians had penetrated the DNC network. Then on Oct. 7, intelligence officials publicly stated that the hacking had occurred, that the Russians were behind it and that “only Russia’s   officials could have authorized these activities. ” That was an obvious reference to Russian President Vladimir Putin. Trump may have missed the October announcement. He was preoccupied with the infamous “Access Hollywood” video, which The Post had released the same afternoon. At the time, the video captured most of the media attention. It seemed to present a dire threat to Trump’s chances of winning the election. Trump weathered that storm and is a month away from being sworn in as president. Now he has a bigger problem awaiting him when he takes office, one he seems resistant to addressing. In the past week, intelligence officials have added to their findings, concluding that the motivation behind Russia’s hacking was to help Trump win.      (Reuters)   The findings about Russian interference and the motive behind their actions will not change the outcome of the election. On Monday, the electoral college’s electors will cast their votes in the states, and no doubt Trump will have his comfortable majority secured. Throughout the campaign, Trump described his philosophy as one of “America first. ” He drew an enthusiastic response from his supporters for signaling that he would refocus U. S. foreign policy, away from the course pursued for the past eight years by President Obama and seemingly abandoning a broader consensus that has guided presidents of both parties for decades. But if standing up to Russian attempts to interfere with American democracy isn’t a foundational principle of an “America first” policy, what is? Trump’s response has suggested a different focus and different philosophy, one that might be described as “Trump first,” rather than “America first. ” His instincts appear to be aimed at shielding himself.  The hacking has become the elephant in the room since the election. It is a significant national security threat that Trump will have to deal with and also a roiling political debate that has threatened to complicate the transfer of power. Trump’s posture toward Putin and to the hacking long has puzzled and alarmed current and former government officials who have experience in these areas. His friendly attitude toward Putin is contrary to the views of officials in both parties about the man behind Russian aggression in various parts of the world. His invitation to Russia to try to hack Clinton’s emails, issued last summer during the Democratic National Convention, was inexcusable, even if in jest. He has long resisted embracing the evidence that the Russians were behind the hacking. He said it could have been done by other countries or by “somebody sitting on their bed who weighs 400 pounds. ”      (Jason   Washington Post)   When it was reported about a week ago that the CIA had concluded that the Russians were trying to help him win the election, he responded with a tweet slamming the intelligence community for claiming that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction in the   to the Iraq War. The CIA was tragically wrong in that case, but was it necessary for the incoming president to publicly rebuke and provoke the agency? All of this has put Trump at odds with the intelligence community he will soon oversee as commander in chief. That should be as worrisome to the incoming president as it is to the intelligence professionals. It has also put him at odds with many Republicans in Congress who are joining Democrats in their call for a thorough investigation and who already question whether Rex Tillerson, the ExxonMobil chief executive nominated by Trump to become secretary of state, is too friendly toward Putin. Meanwhile, the political implications of the hacking have added to the raw emotions left behind by an election outcome that surprised people in both parties. Clinton is on record as believing that the combination of the Russian hacking and especially the interference of FBI Director James B. Comey over her emails cost her the election.  Caught in the middle is Obama, who is obviously loyal to Clinton and disappointed that Trump will be his successor. During his Friday news conference, he skirted some direct questions, showing the degree to which he is trying to maintain a working relationship with Trump during the transition while still trying to highlight the findings of the intelligence community. As he put it, “not much happens in Russia without Vladimir Putin. ” Since the election, Trump has rejected what would seem to be the obvious course to follow in light of the conclusions of the intelligence community. The simpler reaction would have been to respond the way many in Congress did, which was to express outrage at the interference and call for an investigation to examine exactly how the cyberintrusion happened and how similar activities can be prevented in the future. Instead, he has continued to question the intelligence community and to suggest partisan motivations of those who accept the findings. Perhaps his fear is that the more legitimacy is given to the conclusions that the Russians were motivated by their desire to help him or hurt Clinton, the less his victory will be seen as legitimate. Or perhaps all of his tweets and statements are a prelude to Monday’s electoral college vote, after which he will feel freer to reverse course and join others in calling for a congressional investigation to go along with the review and report ordered by Obama. In recent days, some of his advisers appeared to be preparing for that kind of shift. But the American people  —   and Trump advisers  —   have learned that no one safely speaks for Trump other than Trump himself. And they have learned how difficult it is for Trump to admit error. On top of all this is the  ’s apparent lack of interest in receiving daily intelligence briefings, a standard procedure for presidents. That raises questions about how he plans to conduct foreign policy. Will he seek all available evidence as he weighs decisions? Who will he listen to and trust? And will he ever have a trusting relationship with the vast   resources at his command? Trump is still a month away from occupying the Oval Office. But he is already caught up in a controversy that will define the opening of his presidency and is struggling to find his way.  "

","       Donald Trump has named Rep. Mick Mulvaney ( . C.) as his director of the Office of Management and Budget, signaling his intent to slash spending and address the deficit as president. Mulvaney, 49, was elected to Congress in 2010 in the wave that brought a cohort of younger, staunchly conservative members into the House. Mulvaney quickly staked out ground as one of Congress’s most outspoken fiscal hawks  —   playing a key role in the 2011 showdown between President Obama and House Republicans that ended in the passage of strict budget caps. He has been an advocate for spending cuts, often taking on his own party to push for more aggressive curbs to government spending. “We are going to do great things for the American people with Mick Mulvaney leading the Office of Management and Budget,” Trump said in a statement. “Right now we are nearly $20 trillion in debt, but Mick is a very   leader with deep convictions for how to responsibly manage our nation’s finances and save our country from drowning in red ink. “With Mick at the head of OMB, my administration is going to make smart choices about America’s budget, bring new accountability to our federal government, and renew the American taxpayer’s trust in how their money is spent,” he added.        Donald Trump named Rep. Mick Mulvaney ( . C.) as his director of the Office of Management and Budget. Here’s what you need to know about the conservative Congressman. (Claritza   Washington Post)   Trump has announced plans for increased defense spending in a massive infrastructure bill. Adding Mulvaney to his administration could help ease concerns from fiscal conservatives about the cost of such plans and their effect on the deficit. A founding member of the House Freedom Caucus, a group of about three dozen conservative   that has used its leverage to push Republican leaders to the right, Mulvaney was among the group of lawmakers widely credited with pushing House Speaker John A. Boehner ( ) out of power in 2015. He has broken with members of his own party at times, particularly around defense spending issues. Mulvaney has been a fierce critic of the use of a separate war funding stream known as overseas contingency operations, a budgetary maneuver used to skirt spending caps to fund military and   operations abroad. Mulvaney has allied himself with Democrats at times to try to force defense spending cuts. Mulvaney is also an advocate of a   amendment to the Constitution. Mulvaney has had largely friendly relations with Boehner’s successor, Paul D. Ryan ( . ). He was among three members who offered nominating speeches for Ryan in a   House GOP leadership election last month. In a statement Ryan praised Mulvaney’s appointment to head OMB. “Mick Mulvaney is the absolute right choice,” Ryan said. “In Congress, he has been a conservative reformer from day one, proposing solutions to fix the budget process and our regulatory system. ” “At OMB, he will lead the work he has started to improve the way government does the people’s business,” he added. Among Mulvaney’s chief duties will be overseeing the most dramatic overhaul of the nation’s tax code since President Ronald Reagan. Trump has pledged to streamline the process for individual households and slash the rate for corporations from 35 percent to 15 percent. The changes are a central component of the administration’s promise to boost economic growth to 4 percent or higher, a message that resonated with voters still bruised by the Great Recession but that many economists say is unsustainable. In addition, Trump has said that stronger growth would mean his tax proposal would not contribute to the national debt, and he has vowed not to cut expensive but popular entitlement programs such as Medicare and Social Security. But experts have been skeptical of those claims, and Mulvaney would be responsible for reconciling the numbers. One analysis by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimated Trump’s tax plan would cost more than $5. 3 trillion over the next decade. Even after factoring in faster economic growth, Trump’s proposals are expected to add at least $2. 6 trillion to the debt over the next decade, according to the nonpartisan Tax Foundation. Trump has also called for as much as $1 trillion in infrastructure spending, an investment long sought by Democrats even though GOP leaders, including House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (Wis.) and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.) remain opposed. It is not clear how Trump intends to pay for rebuilding the nation’s roads and bridges. Trump’s nominee for commerce secretary, billionaire industrialist Wilbur Ross, and economic adviser Peter Navarro have proposed tax credits intended to spur $1 trillion in private spending. But Trump’s website suggests that fulfilling his pledge will require at least some public money, although it does not detail where the funding will come from. Mulvaney has spent the past few years learning Spanish and has been one of just a handful of GOP lawmakers able to appear on   television programs to explain and defend Republican policies. Ylan Q.

Then the story took an even darker twist. ",Washington Post,Pamela Constable,2016-12-17,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161218010609/https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/in-pakistan-five-girls-were-killed-for-having-fun-then-the-story-took-an-even-darker-twist/2016/12/16/f2adbd5e-c13a-11e6-92e8-c07f4f671da4_story.html
","  ISLAMABAD, Pakistan  —   It was just a few seconds, a video clip of several young women laughing and clapping to music, dressed for a party or a wedding in orange headscarves and robes with floral patterns. Then a few more seconds of a young man dancing alone, apparently in the same room. The cellphone video was made six years ago, in a village deep in Kohistan, a rugged area of northwest Pakistan. It was the last time the young women, known only as Bazeegha, Sareen Jan, Begum Jan, Amina and Shaheen, have ever been definitively seen alive. What happened to them remains a mystery. Their fates have been shrouded by cultural taboos, official inertia, implacable resistance from elders and religious leaders suspected of ordering their deaths, and elaborate subterfuges by the families who reportedly carried out those orders.  Even in Pakistan, where hundreds of  “honor killings” are reported every year, this case was extreme. According to court filings and interviews with people who investigated it, the families confined the girls for weeks, threw boiling water and hot coals on them, then killed them and buried them somewhere in the Kohistan hills. Later, when investigators appeared, relatives and community leaders insisted that the girls were still alive and produced a second set of   girls to prove it. They even disfigured one girl’s thumbprints so she couldn’t be checked against the identity of the victim she was supposed to impersonate. The story illustrates many of the reasons Pakistani officials have failed to curb the problem of honor killings. These include the cruel sway of traditional tribal councils, known as jirgas, over uneducated villagers; the lengths to which such leaders may go to defy state authority; and the casual worthlessness they assign to the rights, lives and even identities of young women.  Today, the truth is finally beginning to emerge, mostly through the efforts of a few individuals including Afzal Kohistani, a young man whose brothers were killed as a result of the incident. He spent years seeking help from local and provincial officials, then petitioned the Supreme Court. In 2012, his case was dismissed, but last month the high court reopened it and ordered a new investigation that has produced a chilling report. “This has destroyed my family. The girls are dead, my brothers have been killed and nothing has been done to bring justice or protect us,” said Kohistani, 26, who has received death threats. “I know I will probably be killed, too, but it doesn’t matter,” he said in an interview last week. “What happened is wrong, and it has to change. ” Renewed judicial interest in these   events coincided with another encouraging development: the passage of a new law in Parliament that strengthened judicial powers in   cases. Often, even when such crimes manage to reach the courts, there is no punishment because the law allows victims’ families to “forgive” the perpetrators  —   who are often their own relatives.    The new law, passed in October, gives judges more ammunition to impose life sentences for honor killings in extreme circumstances, allowing them to overrule personal deals by making the murder a crime against the state. But supporters fear that cultural and political resistance will continue to prevent justice being done. “We don’t know yet whether the law will make much difference. Punishment is still not mandatory, and forgiveness can still negate justice,” said Benazir Jatoi, a lawyer who works on women’s rights. “Until there is more political will, I don’t think the lives of ordinary women threatened with honor violence will change. ” The Kohistan case unfolded in a conservative rural region where social mingling between genders is taboo. The girls’ participation in a coed singing party was risky enough, but someone posted the video on the Internet, where it spread rapidly, bringing shame on their community before the vast virtual world.          The head of the local jirga, a Muslim cleric, allegedly issued a religious decree ordering the five girls to be killed for dishonoring their tribe, along with the boy seen dancing and every member of his family. There was no resistance from the community. After the girls were disposed of, several brothers of the boy were also caught and killed. The rest of the family, including Kohistani, fled the area. There things stood for more than a year. No crimes were reported and no one came to investigate. Kohistani, a college graduate from one of the area’s wealthier families, said he repeatedly approached local and provincial officials, reporting the killings and seeking protection, but was chided for opposing the jirga’s verdict.  “No one in my district or my province has ever spoken against honor killing. They tell me I have defamed my culture, my religion, my tribe,” Kohistani said this month. “Everybody knows what happened, but no one is ready to come forward. This an illegal, unconstitutional and   tradition, but people don’t even consider it a crime. ” Finally, with assistance from a lawyer in Islamabad, Kohistani appealed directly to the Supreme Court. Chief Justice Iftikhar Chaudhry, a liberal activist, personally took up the case in 2012 and ordered two   missions sent to the remote area by helicopter.   When the visitors demanded to see the girls, their families at first refused, but eventually presented three girls and said they were the ones in the video. The three delegates had no chance to speak to the girls in private, but they compared their faces to images from the video. Two were convinced of the likenesses; the third, Farzana Bari, said she had doubts.  “I was upset and confused. We had no translators who knew their dialect, and everyone there insisted these were the same girls,” recounted Bari, an academic in Islamabad. “When we got back the second time, I filed a dissenting report, but the judge closed the case. I still feel terrible. ” After that, life in the village apparently returned to normal for several years. One journalist sent photos of both groups of girls to analysts in England, who found only a 14 percent chance they were the same individuals. That evidence was taken to a provincial court, but it declined to take action. Kohistani, in the interview, named each of the original girls and their replacements, who he said were   sisters, cousins and   .   Finally, last month, Kohistani’s crusade got an unexpected break when the Supreme Court, under a new chief justice, agreed to accept his petition. Once more, a   mission was sent to the village. This time, it included a district judge and two police officers, armed with government ID records with the heights and thumbprints of the missing girls.  What they encountered was  .  In his report afterward, Kohistan Judge Shoaib Khan said the village elders were “unanimous” in insisting that the girls were alive. But two of the girls they produced were much younger than the victims, according to their official birth dates. A third could not be identified because both thumbs had been burned; her parents insisted that it was from a cooking accident. He concluded that at least two girls did not match the ones in the video and that the others were probably also impostors. “All this leads to the suspicious conclusion that something is wrong at bottom,” Khan wrote. The case, he advised, “needs exhaustive inquiry. ” On a recent day, Kohistani, wearing a conservative suit and carrying a copy of the judge’s report, walked up to the Supreme Court. He smiled slightly as he shook hands with his attorney, and they went inside to wait for the next hearing.        "

"," The Chinese government will return a U. S. naval drone seized this week in the South China Sea, the Pentagon said Saturday, in a move that promises to defuse heightened maritime tensions between the two Pacific powers. Pentagon press secretary Peter Cook said that Beijing had agreed to transfer the “ocean glider,” a small unmanned vessel used to assess water conditions, back to the United States, but said details on how and when that would occur had not been decided. The latest spike in U. S.  maritime tensions occurred Thursday, when a Chinese submarine rescue ship close to the USNS Bowditch, an oceanographic survey vessel operating about 50 nautical miles northwest of Subic Bay in the Philippines, took possession of the U. S. drone. The incident occurred within sight of the Bowditch, which tracks the drone as it collects unclassified data on water temperature, salinity and other factors that may affect U. S. naval operations. According to U. S. officials, the Chinese ship refused initial requests from the Bowditch to return the drone. “We have registered our objection to China’s unlawful seizure of a U. S. unmanned underwater vehicle operating in international waters in the South China Sea,” Cook said in a statement.      (Jason Aldag, Julie   Washington Post   Satellite photos courtesy of CSIS)   “Through direct engagement with Chinese authorities, we have secured an understanding that the Chinese will return the [drone] to the United States,” he said.  While the seizure drew criticism from some U. S. lawmakers, statements from Washington and Beijing suggest that both sides are eager to avoid further intensifying tensions at a moment of deep uncertainty in U. S.  relations after the election of Donald Trump to the presidency. Even as China asserts a right to areas of the South and East China seas also claimed by some of its neighbors, it has embarked on an ambitious program of constructing artificial islands, some of which appear to be intended as military outposts. The U. S. military has conducted repeated shows of force, sailing ships or conducting surveillance flights near disputed areas, while at the same time seeking to avoid any serious military escalation with a key commercial partner. Speaking after the Pentagon announced that the drone would be returned, a U. S. defense official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to comment freely, said that the Obama administration was “glad to get it back and put this behind us. ” “It’s somewhat reassuring that senior leadership in Beijing agreed that this was something that should be returned, regardless of the individual actions of their people at sea,” the official said. It is not yet clear who exactly authorized the seizure of the drone.    Those comments came after the Chinese Defense Ministry issued a statement saying the marine device had been taken in the interest of “safe navigation” in the area, according to a report from the Associated Press. The ministry also said the U. S. vessel would be returned “through appropriate means,” the AP reported. The flap over the drone comes as Trump’s election generates concern for Chinese authorities, as the   questions   U. S. policy on China and continues his sharp criticism of Beijing’s trade and monetary policies. Trump angered Chinese officials when he spoke by phone with the president of Taiwan, which Beijing considers a breakaway province. While it is not clear how the Trump administration will handle efforts by China to assert itself in the South China Sea, his stance toward Beijing suggests a hard line. On Saturday morning, Trump issued a tweet that said: “China steals United States Navy research drone in international waters   rips it out of water and takes it to China in unpresidented act. ” He later replaced the tweet with one correcting the spelling of “unprecedented. ”       "

","     Barack Obama’s speech at the 2004 Democratic National Convention in Boston was an astonishing piece of oratory. It was also a bit of sleight of hand. Then a U. S. Senate candidate from Illinois, Obama wove his personal ancestry and biography  —   black and white, Kenya and Kansas, Hawaii and Harvard  —   into the American story of opportunity, multiplicity and solidarity. Not red vs. blue, but united. Out of many, one. David Axelrod calls the address a love letter to America. “In no other country on Earth is my story even possible,” Obama declared, his most poignant line of the night. Two words in that sentence would matter most. Throughout Obama’s time in the White House, his touchstone would not be that singular country on Earth, whose politics he was never able to bind together. Rather, it would be the man himself. My story. This was a presidency preoccupied with Obama’s exceptionalism as much as with America’s. Modern presidents have often become conflated with the challenges and aspirations of their times. We speak of Richard Nixon’s silent majority, Jimmy Carter’s malaise, Ronald Reagan’s morning in America and George W. Bush’s wars. But with Obama, this personal identification has been compulsive, strategic and unceasing. In his 2006 manifesto, “The Audacity of Hope,” Obama called himself “a prisoner of my own biography,” yet throughout his presidency, biography would also empower him. Whether in foreign policy, race relations, electoral politics, or even in the meaning of the hope and change he promised, Obama has turned to his life and symbolism as a default reference and   governing tool. The personalized presidency can be inspiring. It can also feel arrogant. And it can bypass some of the very norms and institutions Obama rhapsodizes about so frequently  —   a dangerous proposition as the country braces for an unpredictable, unmoored successor. *** Biography plays a central role in all political campaigns, with candidates deploying their life stories to buttress their arguments. During Obama’s first presidential run, however, the story did not just strengthen the message  —   it became interchangeable with it. This was not by accident but by design. “Barack is the personification of his own message for this country, that we get past the things that divide us and focus on the things that unite us,” Axelrod, the campaign’s chief strategist, told the New York Times in 2007. “He is his own vision. ” So much so, in fact, that when   Obama endured criticism for recycling   officials into top posts, he argued that it didn’t matter, that he was enough. “I was never of the belief that the way you bring about change is to not hire anybody who knows how things work, and to start from scratch and completely reinvent the wheel,” Obama said to The Washington Post in January 2009. “I’m the one who brings change. It is my vision. It is my agenda. ” Turns out he was the change we had been waiting for. His effort to improve relations with the Muslim world, for instance, was premised on the notion that his personal story could make a difference. In his speech at Cairo University in June 2009, the president said that a “new beginning” was possible in the troubled relationship. “Part of this conviction is rooted in my own experience,” he explained. He invoked his Kenyan family, with its generations of Muslims; recalled his childhood in Indonesia; and cited his work with Muslim communities in Chicago. His story was supposed to dispel foreign stereotypes of a   imperial United States and show that not all Americans shared apocalyptic visions of Islam. Obama’s personal narrative is so flexible that he has cited it as proof of his empathy for Israel, too. As the president told the Atlantic’s Jeffrey Goldberg, he once interrupted Benjamin Netanyahu when he felt the Israeli prime minister was being condescending, lecturing him about the dangers Israel faced. “Bibi, you have to understand something,” the president said. “I’m the African American son of a single mother, and I live here, in this house. I live in the White House. I managed to get elected president of the United States. You think I don’t understand what you’re talking about, but I do. ” (Tensions between the two leaders would endure throughout Obama’s presidency nonetheless, with an animus that was reportedly both substantive and personal.) [How Clinton and Obama tried to run the world  —   while trying to manage each other]      During his public life, President Barack Obama has often turned to his personal story as a touchstone to relate to the public. Here are four moments that stand out. (Adriana   Washington Post)   Everyone was supposed to fall under the sway of the Obamaness. As a candidate, Obama explained the logic. “I think that if you can tell people, ‘We have a president in the White House who still has a grandmother living in a hut on the shores of Lake Victoria and has a sister who’s   married to a Chinese Canadian,’ then they’re going to think that he may have a better sense of what’s going on in our lives and in our country,” Obama told journalist James Traub in 2007. “And they’d be right. ” The Obama story would also surface around sensitive matters of national security. In a 2009 speech at the National Archives, the president stressed the importance of keeping America safe while upholding our laws and values, noting that the documents preserved in that building  —   the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, the Bill of Rights  —   were the foundation of liberty in America and a light for the world. And then, no surprise, it came back to him. “I stand here today as someone whose own life was made possible by these documents. My father came to these shores in search of the promise that they offered. My mother made me rise before dawn to learn their truths when I lived as a child in a foreign land. My own American journey was paved by generations of citizens who gave meaning to those simple words  —   ‘to form a more perfect union.’ I’ve studied the Constitution as a student, I’ve taught it as a teacher, I’ve been bound by it as a lawyer and a legislator. I took an oath to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution as commander in chief, and as a citizen, I know that we must never, ever, turn our back on its enduring principles for expedience sake. ” Over time, Obama would rely on that lawyerly background to render lofty principles more malleable, with a “don’t worry, it’s me” approach to   powers. When the New York Times described the president’s personal role in selecting terrorists (including a U. S. citizen) to target for attack, for example, it noted how “the control he exercises also appears to reflect Mr. Obama’s striking  : he believes, according to several people who have worked closely with him, that his own judgment should be brought to bear on strikes. ” After not fully establishing the limits on such powers, Obama is turning them over to a new    with no less   and much less  . Obama drew on the personal to address the revelations in 2013 about the National Security Agency’s electronic surveillance. After reassuring Americans on the extent of NSA oversight, he offered some unusual comfort. “I will leave this office at some point, sometime in the . . . next   years, and after that, I will be a private citizen,” Obama said. “And I suspect that, on a list of people who might be targeted so that somebody could read their emails or listen to their phone calls, I’d probably be pretty high on that list. It’s not as if I don’t have a personal interest in making sure my privacy is protected. ” So because Obama worries about his own future privacy, we should trust that he would never violate ours? That argument requires a generous helping of  . Then again, as Henry Kissinger suggested recently, “Obama seems to think of himself not as a part of a political process, but as sui generis, a unique phenomenon with a unique capacity. ” (And Kissinger seems like a guy who knows the feeling.) *** Undoubtedly, it is in race relations that Obama’s personal story as the first black president has taken on the most salience. His political ascent became a source of   dreams and incessant racist attacks, and rendered Obama an African American studies professor for the nation during what would become the Black Lives Matter era. In that role, his lectures leaned heavily on his biography. When videos of the Rev. Jeremiah Wright’s sermons denouncing America threatened Obama’s presidential bid, the candidate drew upon his story to deliver the most memorable speech of the 2008 race. “I believe deeply that we cannot solve the challenges of our time. . . unless we perfect our union by understanding that we may have different stories, but we hold common hopes; that we may not look the same and we may not have come from the same place, but we all want to move in the same direction,” he said at Philadelphia’s National Constitution Center. “. . . This belief comes from my unyielding faith in the decency and generosity of the American people. But it also comes from my own American story. ” Such faith may have been misplaced. Throughout his presidency, Obama staked so much on “a goodwill that his own personal history tells him exists in the larger country,” journalist   Coates argues in the latest Atlantic, adding that “only a black man with that same biography could underestimate his opposition’s resolve to destroy him. ” Obama’s frequent calls for African American communities to take greater personal responsibility for their conditions, his preference for universal efforts to improve education and opportunity for all over targeted programs to help minority populations  —   these, too, reflect a trust forged through his particular experience. [The ‘racial procrastination’ of Barack Obama] The controversy surrounding Wright involved Obama’s faith and relationship with his former pastor, so the personal emphasis there was inevitable. But when Trayvon Martin was killed by George Zimmerman in central Florida in February 2012, Obama, evocatively yet unmistakably, brought the discussion back to himself again. “If I had a son, he would look like Trayvon,” the president remarked. After Zimmerman’s acquittal, Obama detailed the indignities and injustices black men face in America, explaining that such experiences informed how African Americans viewed that verdict. Then, as he often has, the president concluded by stressing the strides the country has made. “Each successive generation seems to be making progress in changing attitudes when it comes to race,” Obama said. “It doesn’t mean we’re in a   society. It doesn’t mean that racism is eliminated. But when I talk to Malia and Sasha, and I listen to their friends and I see them interact, they’re better than we are  —   they’re better than we were  —   on these issues. ” It is noteworthy that he cited his family as evidence, an individualized benchmark of national  . Similarly, when he spoke in 2014 on a grand jury’s decision to not indict Ferguson, Mo. police officer Darren Wilson for killing Michael Brown, Obama reiterated that the nation was moving forward. “We have made enormous progress in race relations over the course of the past several decades,” he said. “I’ve witnessed that in my own life. ” In his recent book, “The Black Presidency: Barack Obama and the Politics of Race in America,” Michael Eric Dyson lingers over that moment. “Obama lauded the racial progress that he said he had witnessed ‘in my own life,’ substituting his body for our black bodies, his life for ours, and signaled again how his story of advancement was ours. ” The problem, Dyson argues, is that despite his enormous symbolic power, Obama is an imperfect  . “The ordinary black person possesses neither Obama’s protections against peril nor his triumphant trajectory that will continue long after he leaves office,” Dyson writes. “And Obama’s narrative does not answer a haunting question: If America can treat him as badly as it does . . . what will it do to the masses of Michael Browns in black communities?” *** In multiple speeches, Obama has offered a distinct vision of American exceptionalism  —   that of a country constantly striving, sometimes struggling, to perfect itself. It is a process he interprets through his own story. In his 1995 memoir, “Dreams From My Father,” Obama tells of his hope that “the larger American community, black, white, and brown, could somehow redefine itself  —   I believed that it might, over time, admit the uniqueness of my own life. ” Perhaps, as president, Obama has turned so often to his story because of this belief that America was validating it. Or maybe because the inner circle of his 2008 campaign, the truest of true believers in the Obama story, exerted inordinate influence over his White House. Or perhaps Obama’s tendency fits our era of oversharing,   and   arguments. Or it could be simply that he believes, as he argued in a 2006 speech on faith and politics, that Americans are missing “a narrative arc to their lives,” and he is supplying us with his own. It certainly worked with voters when he was on the ballot. In both the 2008 and 2012 elections, Obama bested his opponents on the “cares about people like me” question in exit polls. But it was an appeal that remained with him alone. Indeed, one result of Obama’s personalized presidency is that his electoral fortunes far outshined those of the Democrats. After his two presidential victories, Democrats suffered sharp reversals in both midterms, and the party has seen its power diminished at all levels under Obama. [The liberal war over the Obama legacy has already begun] “Washington Democrats hated the White House for believing that the Obama brand and the Democratic Party brand were distinct, and that one was paramount over the other,” NBC’s Chuck Todd writes in “The Stranger: Barack Obama in the White House,” published in 2014. “The White House did little to dispel the notion that Obama came first, over and above the party. ” When Obama did inject himself into his party’s contests, he often emphasized his legacy. “I am not on the ballot this fall,” he stated in a speech on the economy delivered one month before the 2014 elections. “. . . But make no mistake: These policies are on the ballot. Every single one of them. ” At the time, the president was deeply unpopular in key states, and his personalization of the race did no favors to his party. In this year’s presidential contest, Obama campaigned with more vigor and, at times, with arrogance. “I will consider it a personal insult, an insult to my legacy, if this community lets down its guard and fails to activate itself in this election,” he urged a Congressional Black Caucus gathering. “You want to give me a good  ? Go vote. ” That vote is now in, and the presidential candidate promising to dismantle the Obama legacy won, even while Obama still enjoys high approval ratings. Some voters who had cast their ballots for Obama, perhaps even twice, threw their support behind Donald Trump. “I don’t have an explanation for that, to put it bluntly,” White House press secretary Josh Earnest admitted. The answer may not be so mysterious. Even in his party’s most crushing defeat, Obama remains popular because this presidency was less about particular federal programs, or the Democratic Party, or certainly Hillary Clinton, than about Obama himself. They fall low, he goes high. *** The man soon supplanting Obama in the Oval Office is even more enamored with his own story and more dismissive of his own party, and promises to remake the nation on the strength of his personality. “Nobody knows the system better than me,” Trump asserted at the Republican National Convention, “which is why I alone can fix it. ” It is a more concentrated and insidious iteration of the personalized presidency. Trump came to national political prominence on the back of “birther” lies  —   in essence, an effort to retroactively erase Obama’s story  —   and now seeks to unmake Obama’s legacy, too. A president who used his story in an attempt to uplift and empower is giving way to a leader for whom the office seems an exercise in personal brand extension. [Donald Trump’s celebrity won him the White House. It could destroy his presidency.] It is a far different ending than a captivating Illinois state senator may have imagined 12 years ago. The failure to fulfill that vision of a united America, or bring us closer to it, is now part of the Obama story, too. “The spirit of national conciliation was more than the rhetorical pixie dust of Obama’s 2004 speech to the Democratic National Convention, in Boston, which had brought him to delirious national attention,” New Yorker editor and Obama biographer David Remnick wrote in 2014. “It was also an elemental component of his   his sense that he was uniquely suited to transcend ideology and the grubby battles of the day. Obama is defensive about this now. ” But a new battle is coming, and that defensiveness may prove useful. Trump’s vision for America threatens to make stories such as Obama’s less likely. Will this most   of presidents retreat to speeches and memoirs, or will he fight to preserve the country that indeed made his story possible? What if that’s next  —   the Obama legacy no one saw coming, more about the nation than the man? It would make for a great epilogue.

","     Kim Brooks was preparing to fly home with her two children, ages 4 and 1, after visiting her parents in 2012. She needed to replace a pair of headphones  —   crucial equipment for keeping her preschool son occupied during the 2    flight. As she left her parents’ house for the quick errand, her son asked to come along. But when they got to the store, he refused to get out of the car, where he was playing on an iPad. Brooks faced a choice familiar to all parents. Option 1: Take away the iPad and force the kid out of the car and into the store. He was tired, hungry and out of his routine from visiting Grandma, Brooks later told us, so this would probably cause a monster tantrum as he was physically dragged through the parking lot, the electronics aisle and the checkout line. An errand she could finish in less than five minutes would become a   horror show. Option 2: Let him stay in the locked car and play on his iPad. It was a cool day, the car was parked right in front of the store, he couldn’t go anywhere, and she’d be right back. Brooks, rationally, did just that. She completed her errand, and they returned to her parents’ house and then flew home without incident. So Brooks was astonished when, on the way home from the airport, she received a voice mail from the police informing her that a bystander had noticed her leaving her son in the car and had recorded it using a smartphone camera. She was eventually charged with contributing to the delinquency of a minor. On her lawyer’s advice, she agreed to mandatory community service and parenting education, afraid that if she tried to fight the charges, she could lose her kids. It might have been natural for the bystander to assume Brooks’s son was in danger  —   after all, reports of crimes against children seem increasingly common. But actually the opposite is true: Crime of all types, including against children, has been steadily declining for decades, and there has never been a safer time to be a kid in America. Why, then, are so many of today’s parents  —   who walked to school and played outdoors unsupervised when they were young  —   afraid to give their own children the same freedom and independence? In a recent study we conducted at the University of California at Irvine, we found striking evidence that our fears about the dangers of leaving children unsupervised have become inflated in recent years (even as the actual risks of doing so have declined) simply because the practice has become socially unacceptable. More specifically, we found that people consistently, but unconsciously, increase their estimates of the danger facing unsupervised children to better justify or rationalize the moral disapproval they feel toward parents who leave those children alone, even briefly.  In six experiments, we asked more than 1, 500 participants to read five different stories in which a child is left alone for a short period of time. Situations ranged from a    left asleep for 15 minutes in a cool car parked in an underground garage to an    reading a book for 45 minutes at a coffee shop one block away from her parent. Different participants read slightly different versions of each story, varying only in the reason for the parent’s absence. In one version of each story, the absence is unintentional: A mother (or, in a later experiment, a father) is kept away from her child because she is hit by a car and knocked unconscious. In the other four, the mom or dad chooses to leave the child alone in the same circumstances to go to work, volunteer for charity, relax or meet an illicit lover. After reading each story, participants estimated how much danger the child was in while the parent was away, on a scale of 1 (lowest) to 10 (highest). Survey respondents saw all of these situations as highly dangerous: The average risk estimate was 6. 99, and the most common estimate in every situation was 10. But they judged children who were intentionally left alone to be in significantly greater danger than those whose parents left them unintentionally in otherwise identical circumstances. This is especially striking because children left alone on purpose are in fact almost certainly safer than those left alone by accident. Parents who choose to leave kids alone can take steps to make the situation safer, such as reviewing safety rules, letting the child know when they will be back, and making sure that the child has a phone and knows how to contact them in an emergency. The fact that people make the opposite judgment  —   that kids are in more danger when parents leave on purpose  —   strongly suggests that their estimates of risk have been unconsciously inflated to help justify their stronger moral disapproval of parents who choose to leave children unsupervised. Another sign that estimates of risk to unsupervised children are inflated to better justify negative judgments of their parents is the fact that in most of the experiments, children who were left alone when a parent went to meet an illicit lover were seen as being in greater danger than those left alone in precisely the same circumstances so a parent could go to work, volunteer for charity or simply relax. Although small, this difference was statistically significant, and it helps illustrate the relationship between subjects’ moral outrage at the parent’s conduct and their corresponding estimates of the risk or danger posed to a child by that conduct. The same patterns emerged when mothers were replaced with fathers, with one striking difference: For fathers but not mothers, a   absence was judged to be significantly less dangerous than his other voluntary absences  —   in fact, it was seen as no more dangerous than his involuntary absence. This might suggest that   absences are seen as more obligatory and less voluntary for men than they are for women. In two other experiments, we asked subjects to estimate not only how much danger the child was in but also the extent to which the parent had done something morally wrong. Ever optimistic about human rationality, we thought that giving subjects a way to express their moral judgments directly might help them separate those judgments from risk estimates and think more clearly about whether the children were actually in danger. In fact, though, just the opposite happened. When subjects were invited to make explicit moral judgments alongside their estimates of risk, those estimates became even more inflated by moral disapproval. Even parents in the “involuntary absence” stories  —   who turned away for just a moment (e. g. to pay for parking or return a library book) before being hit by a car  —   were not held blameless, receiving an average “moral wrongness” judgment of 3. 05 on a   scale. Overall, estimates of the danger facing a child closely followed subjects’ judgments of the wrongness of the parent’s actions. In other words, people don’t just think that leaving children alone is dangerous and therefore immoral  —   they also think it is immoral and therefore dangerous.  But why have our beliefs about the dangers to unsupervised children changed so much in only a single generation that a new social norm has sprung up? The process may have started with the expansion of the news cycle throughout the 1980s and 1990s, when dramatically increased coverage of tragedies befalling children led people to overestimate the frequency of such events. As it became widely accepted that “good” parents don’t leave their kids alone for any reason, inflated perceptions of risk and increasing moral outrage became mutually reinforcing. To better rationalize or justify the condemnation of parents who violated this new norm, estimates of risk to children left alone became inflated. Those higher estimates of risk generated even greater outrage against parents of unsupervised children, producing in turn even larger estimates of risk to those children and so on, in a quickly escalating process. The unfortunate consequences of this newfound hysteria include a hypervigilant style of parenting that is probably not good for either children or parents. Children lose out on the physical and   benefits of spending long hours outdoors with friends, and parents cannot give children the     experiences with independence and responsibility that they need to become competent adults. Perhaps even more troubling, this new social norm serves to enshrine a kind of class privilege: Parents with limited resources simply cannot afford to indulge the irrational insistence that their children be constantly supervised. To routinely subject such parents to the threat of legal action for leaving their children alone, even in objectively   circumstances, does more than simply stigmatize their behavior: It effectively criminalizes their poverty. The unreflective intuitions of neighbors, bystanders, police officers, social workers, district attorneys and judges concerning the danger to children left alone serve as the legal basis for increasingly frequent arrests, charges of neglect or endangerment and even incarceration of parents. But our results show that when people think they are judging danger to a child, much of what they are doing instead is imposing a moral judgment on that child’s parents. At the very least, our findings should caution those who create and enforce public policy to distinguish   assessments of risk to children from intuitive moral judgments about parents, and to avoid investing the latter with the force of law.

Mann,2016-12-16,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161218010609/https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/this-is-what-the-coming-attack-on-climate-science-could-look-like/2016/12/16/e015cc24-bd8c-11e6-94ac-3d324840106c_story.html
","     Michael E. Mann is a professor of atmospheric science and director of the Earth System Science Center at Penn State University. He   with Washington Post cartoonist Tom Toles, “The Madhouse Effect: How Climate Change Denial Is Threatening Our Planet, Destroying Our Politics, and Driving Us Crazy. ”   My Penn State colleagues looked with horror at the police tape across my office door. I had been opening mail at my desk that afternoon in August 2010 when a dusting of white powder fell from the folds of a letter. I dropped the letter, held my breath and slipped out the door as swiftly as I could, shutting it behind me. First I went to the bathroom to scrub my hands. Then I called the police. It turned out to be cornstarch, not anthrax. And it was just one in a long series of threats I’ve received since the late 1990s, when my research illustrated the unprecedented nature of global warming, producing an   temperature curve whose shape has been likened to a hockey stick.  I’ve faced hostile investigations by politicians, demands for me to be fired from my job, threats against my life and even threats against my family. Those threats have diminished in recent years, as   climate change has become recognized as the overwhelming scientific consensus and as climate science has received the support of the federal government. But with the coming Trump administration, my colleagues and I are steeling ourselves for a renewed onslaught of intimidation, from inside and outside government. It would be bad for our work and bad for our planet. Donald Trump, of course, famously dismissed global warming as a Chinese hoax and “a big scam for a lot of people to make a lot of money. ” This month, he framed his position on climate change as “nobody really knows  —   it’s not something that’s so hard and fast. ” He has vowed to cancel U. S. participation in the Paris climate agreement and threatened to block the Clean Power Plan, a measure to reduce carbon emissions in the power sector. The strong   bent of his advisers is similarly ominous. Among the members of his Environmental Protection Agency transition team are some of the most notorious climate change deniers. One adviser has threatened to cut NASA’s entire climate research program  disparaging it, with no apparent sense of irony, as “heavily politicized. ” Trump’s nominee for energy secretary, Rick Perry, wrote in his 2010 book that “we have been experiencing a cooling trend” (in reality, 2016 will go down as the third consecutive   year for global temperatures) and when he was governor of Texas, his administration removed all references to climate change from a report on rising sea levels. Trump’s proposed interior secretary, Rep. Ryan Zinke ( .) plays down climate change as “not proven science” and has a dismal record on the environment, voting again and again in favor of the fossil fuel industry. Rex Tillerson, Trump’s choice for secretary of state, represents those interests even more directly as the chief executive of ExxonMobil. And then there’s Scott Pruitt, the attorney general of Oklahoma and Trump’s pick for EPA administrator. When it comes to fossil fuel advocacy and climate inaction, Pruitt checks all the boxes. He has received substantial campaign funding from the oil and gas industry and is a   “leading advocate against the EPA’s activist agenda. ” Among the various lawsuits he has brought against the agency is his current suit against the Clean Power Plan. Fox, meet henhouse.  But it is the disrespect Pruitt displays for science that my colleagues and I find most distressing. Consider this statement from a commentary he published this year in National Review: “Scientists continue to disagree about the degree and extent of global warming and its connection to the actions of mankind. That debate should be encouraged  —   in classrooms, public forums, and the halls of Congress. ” The assertion betrays profound ignorance of the state of our scientific knowledge (which is that climate change is real,   and already disruptive). Even more pernicious, Pruitt actively encourages others to promote that ignorance, even to children, who will most bear the brunt of unmitigated climate change. Add to all this the Trump transition team’s alarming request that the Energy Department identify employees and contractors who have been involved in climate meetings during the Obama administration. Trump’s people backed away from the request Wednesday, stating that it had not been authorized. Still, it was enough to prompt a massive effort to archive government climate data in ways that would protect it from Trump administration tampering. It was enough to motivate my fellow climate scientists and me at an annual meeting in San Francisco this past week to stage a rally in support of science. “This is a frightening moment,” Harvard professor Naomi Oreskes told the crowd. “We have seen in the last few weeks how the reins of the federal government are being handed over to the fossil fuel industry. ”  We are afraid that four (possibly eight) years of denial and delay might commit the planet to not just feet, but yards, of sea level rise, massive coastal flooding (made worse by more frequent Katrina and   storms) historic deluges, and summer after summer of devastating heat and drought across the country. We also fear an era of McCarthyist attacks on our work and our integrity. It’s easy to envision, because we’ve seen it all before. We know we could be hauled into Congress to face hostile questioning from climate change deniers. We know we could be publicly vilified by politicians. We know we could be at the receiving end of federal subpoenas demanding our personal emails. We know we could see our research grants audited or revoked. I faced all of those things a decade ago, the last time Republicans had full control of our government. Before an important climate bill vote in 2005, Sen. James Inhofe ( .)  —   sometimes called “Senator Snowball” for his stunt introducing a snowball on the Senate floor as ostensible evidence against global warming  —   attacked me by name in a Senate speech, maligning my research methods and findings. Later that year, Rep. Joe Barton ( .) then chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee  —   like Inhofe, a leading recipient of fossil fuel funding, and known for his apology to BP after the Deepwater Horizon Gulf of Mexico oil spill  —   threatened a congressional subpoena against me to obtain all the correspondence, notes and     scribbles spanning my entire career. I’ve also been harassed at the state level. In Pennsylvania, an organization funded by conservative Richard Mellon Scaife persuaded Republican state senators to threaten to hold my university’s funding hostage until “appropriate action” was taken against me. In Virginia,   General Ken Cuccinelli, a tea party Republican, sued the University of Virginia for all my personal emails from when I was teaching there. After Cuccinelli was unsuccessful, a Koch   front group attempted to sue for the same emails. That effort, too, was ultimately blocked by the Virginia Supreme Court, which ruled that unpublished research should be protected in the interest of academic freedom.  In all, I’ve been through roughly a dozen investigations prompted by climate change deniers. Each time, I’ve been exonerated. Investigators find that my methods are sound and my data is replicable. (And, indeed, I’ve been recognized by the scientific community with numerous awards and accolades for my work.) But by then, much time has been lost, expense has been incurred and I’ve endured abuse and vilification. And then there have been the threats of violence. I’ve received email warnings that “the public will come after you,” suggesting that I’ll find myself “six feet under” and hoping to read that I had “committed suicide. ” Such threats could spike again under a president and Congress hostile to climate science. As we’ve seen recently, a segment of Americans is receptive to fake news, and some are eager to act on it. Wild conspiracy theories have propelled a woman to make death threats against the parent of a child killed at Sandy Hook Elementary and motivated a man to discharge an assault rifle in a family pizza restaurant in Washington.  I fear the chill that could descend. I worry especially that younger scientists might be deterred from going into climate research (or any topic where scientific findings can prove inconvenient to powerful vested interests). As someone who has weathered many attacks, I would urge these scientists to have courage. The fate of the planet hangs in the balance. Twitter: @MichaelEMann                                     "
142310,217736,How Russia overtook China as our biggest cyber enemy,Washington Post,James Lewis,2016-12-16,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161218010609/https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2016/12/16/how-russia-overtook-china-as-our-biggest-cyber-enemy/
","     In June 2015, the U. S. government discovered something horrifying: The Office of Personnel Management had been hacked by China. The attackers had stolen the Social Security numbers, performance ratings and job assignments of millions of current and former federal employees. It wasn’t the first time the Chinese had been tied to security breaches in the government. They had gained access to the computers of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. ’s top officials as well as sensitive data in government employees’ security clearance files. The Chinese military was able to steal weapons designs, data on advanced technologies and insight into U. S. government policies. They had collected information about America’s electrical power grid, gas lines and waterworks. Headlines about China’s attacks bordered on the hysterical. “Successful hacker attack could cripple U. S. infrastructure,” NBC blared. “China hacks the world,” the Christian Science Monitor declared. The National Interest called China’s data theft a “national security threat. ” Over the past year, though, China has largely faded from the conversation. It’s not because its hackers have gone away. The Chinese continue to extract secrets from the U. S. government. But their efforts are, and have always been, far less scary than Russia’s brazen new challenge in the information space. Unlike China, the Russians aren’t using their cyberspies to steal business insights or gather information that officials can use in private negotiations with the United States. They’re looking to disrupt elections in the United States and Europe, break NATO, and undermine democratic values  —   big strategic goals that President Vladi mir Putin energetically pursues. Russia has become the biggest threat in cyberspace, and it will be very hard to defeat.  Both Russia and China have absconded with America’s secrets for decades. China’s efforts have been better known because Chinese hackers have gotten caught more. As the New York Times reported, they stole “designs for the   fighter jet, corporate secrets for rolling steel, even the blueprints for gas pipelines that supply much of the United States. ” In 2008, they accessed the campaign servers of Barack Obama and John McCain, stealing internal position papers and communications, the Times said. Those documents were never leaked. Russian hackers have used more sophisticated techniques and, as a result, have operated mostly under the radar, navigating their way into the networks of major agencies, including the Defense and State departments. They have also gained access to U. S. Central Command, the White House, energy companies and critical infrastructure around the country. Today, China’s cyberespionage efforts have become more refined. But they’re still focused on gathering information as quietly as possible. China isn’t looking to take down U. S. infrastructure, and its spies generally no longer steal secrets from foreign companies to help their own. President Xi Jinping has professionalized and centralized cyberspying, and China is careful to avoid anything that could look like an attack. The Russians are not. The country’s aims are much more aggressive  —   and personal. Its leaders believe that the United States is trying to use the Internet (which the Kremlin calls a tool of the CIA) to remake the world in its own Western liberal image. Putin’s henchman Dmitry Medvedev, Russia’s prime minister, even claimed that Western social media is part of a plan for Arab   political unrest in his country, saying that “they have been preparing such a scenario for us, and now they will try even harder to implement it. ” As a result, Russian hackers aren’t just looking for information that could bolster their business efforts or improve their ability to negotiate with Washington. They’re aggressively working to destabilize and destroy democracy. The Democratic National Committee hack, which has been tied to Russia, was only one of several   incidents. The Russians allegedly hacked the German Bundestag. They broke into a leading French TV network (pretending to be the Islamic State) and took it offline. A power plant in Ukraine was hacked as a warning to Kiev. Russian hackers have been accused of planting false news to undercut a partnership between Sweden and NATO. European intelligence services say the Russians are more active and more dangerous than at any other time since the Cold War. This is what Russia calls a “new generation of warfare,” which uses hacking, leaks and nontraditional weapons such as RT, an   news site with a strident   tone. Russia’s government has hired hundreds of trolls to plant   messages in the comment sections of Western media outlets, uses “chatbots” to flood social media with hostile comments, and, of course, leaks purloined emails through various organizations, including WikiLeaks. China doesn’t do this.  Last week, Obama pledged to retaliate against Russian hackers, telling NPR “we need to take action. And we will. ” But figuring out what comes next has been a struggle. We can’t unleash a major U. S. Cyber Command operation without risking war. Some proposals put forward by experts are silly, such as leaking Putin’s Botox injection schedule. Others are feckless, such trying to embarrass Putin by publicizing pictures of his girlfriends. America needs a better strategy, one that’s more assertive and nimble. And it can’t be focused on Russia alone. Other opponents remain busy and dangerous. North Korea, Iran and China have all tested American cyberdefenses and found them wanting. A good cybersecurity strategy can’t play   . We need an approach that convinces opponents it’s dangerous to attack the United States, and if they do, there will be consequences. The response to North Korea’s Sony hack shows that opponents’ behavior can be changed: After the United States imposed retaliatory sanctions, the number of attacks decreased significantly. We can reshape   if we take action. We must."
142311,217737,Trump’s outrageous lies come straight from big businesses’ playbook,Washington Post,Ari Rabin-Havt,2016-12-16,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161218010609/https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2016/12/16/trumps-outrageous-lies-come-straight-from-big-businessess-playbook/
","     Donald Trump surrogate Scottie Nell Hughes recently told WAMU’s Diane Rehm that “there’s no such thing, unfortunately, anymore, as facts. ” She’s right. And that’s the problem. We now disagree not just on our political philosophies but on whether proven facts are true. In this world, Hughes’s observation is the last   truth: Facts are a thing of the past. For the foreseeable future, Americans may find it impossible to debate politics clearly because of a lack of agreement on basic matters of fact; that was certainly the case during this year’s election. And no one has taken more advantage of this than Trump and his   cronies. Trump and his talking heads didn’t create this world. It is a result of a   strategy devised by a number of public affairs practitioners who recognized that lies were the most potent weapon in the fight against progress. Trump emulated some of these disinformation techniques, gleaned from big business, during his campaign.   years ago, as the scientific community neared consensus that tobacco products were dangerous, titans of the tobacco industry came together to meet with John Hill at the Plaza Hotel in New York. This was a rare gathering, as these executives were fighting one another for market share in an immensely competitive business. Hill, the founder of PR conglomerate Hill & Knowlton, recommended that they form a public relations operation, thinly veiled as a scientific institute, to argue that their products were safe. Together, the tobacco executives and Hill created the Tobacco Industry Research Committee, a sham organization designed to spread corporate propaganda to mislead the media, policymakers and the public at large. Their goal was not to convince the majority of Americans that cigarettes did not cause cancer. Instead, they sought to muddy the waters and create a second truth. One truth would emanate from the bulk of the scientific community; the other, from a cadre of people primarily in the employment of the tobacco industry. The organization launched with an ad titled “A Frank Statement to Cigarette Smokers,” which ran in 400 newspapers reaching nearly 43 million readers and stated, “There is no proof that cigarette smoking is one of the causes” of lung cancer.      During a speech in Hershey, Pa. Dec. 15,   Donald Trump told his supporters that he ”didn’t even need” their votes to win the election because of the scope of his victory. (The Washington Post)   The ruse continued for almost five decades, until lawsuits against the industry forced the closure of the “research institute” and the public release of its internal documents. Now anyone with an Internet connection can read the full details of the tobacco industry’s expensive efforts to create an alternate set of facts about its products. Today, 82 percent of Americans believe that smoking is “very harmful. ” However, in the 1950s, the industry’s efforts influenced coverage from journalists as revered as Edward R. Murrow. In 1994, the chief executives of the seven largest tobacco companies told Congress under oath that they did not believe their products were addictive; more than 20 years later, they have yet to face penalties for their apparent perjury. Vice   Mike Pence wrote in an   posted on his 2000 congressional campaign website that, “despite the hysteria from the political class and the media, smoking doesn’t kill. ” That year, his campaign received at least $13, 000 from PACs affiliated with Big Tobacco. The tobacco industry’s success in manufacturing its own truth won it decades of increased profits, even as it put the lives of millions of Americans at risk. This morally objectionable playbook has been used by other industries seeking to avoid necessary regulations. The sugar industry, for instance, has promoted research designed to distract from the health effects of its products. Its Sugar Research Foundation provided funding to Harvard scientists to counter claims that sugar causes heart disease, despite the overwhelming evidence. In defense of their products, sugar lobbyists have also attacked other sweeteners, most recently   corn syrup. The Washington Post reported on an April 2004 memo from the Sugar Association bragging that it had “fed the media with the science to help fuel the public concern and debate on High Fructose Corn Syrup. ” On the other side, those with a financial interest in the use of   corn syrup waged their own campaign, even hiring sex therapist Dr. Ruth to star in an ad in which she counsels a man in a giant corn costume, telling him that “corn sugar” was a “great name” because he was a sugar made from “good American corn” and should “be proud. ” Perhaps unsurprisingly, the consultants and strategists behind these campaigns of falsehood sometimes cross over from the corporate world into the domain of politics. In the 1970s, scientists at Exxon (now ExxonMobil) knew that their products were changing the climate, but the company nonetheless funded think tanks and organizations dedicated to denying the existence of global warming, such as the Heartland Institute and the Competitive Enterprise Institute. Donald Trump has appointed Exxon’s chief executive Rex Tillerson as his secretary of state, while Myron Ebell, who heads Trump’s Environmental Protection Agency transition, directs the Competitive Enterprise Institute’s  “global warming alarmism” Center for Energy and the Environment, an outfit straight out of the tobacco lobby’s handbook. Other veterans of   gambits have also found spots in Trump’s inner circle. In 2009 and 2010, instead of debating the government’s role in providing health care to its citizens, we were stuck in a conversation about whether Obamacare was in fact a plot to create panels with the goal of killing your elderly relatives and disabled children. The “death panels” lie was invented and evangelized by Betsy McCaughey, who had also been a leading opponent of Hillary Clinton’s   reform efforts in the ’90s. No surprise there: McCaughey has strong ties to the tobacco industry. After Sarah Palin coined the term “death panels” on Facebook to refer to McCaughey’s fictitious scare tactic, it was rigorously   by nonpartisan media from the moment the meme began to spread, yet to this day a significant percentage of the public believes that such panels exist. In August, Trump’s campaign announced that McCaughey would serve as an economic adviser. We’ve seen this pattern repeated on issue after issue. A   group invents lies and convinces a substantial share of the public that those lies are true. The propaganda purveyors recognize that the media’s instinct to cover “both sides” of an issue, people’s tendency to believe claims that conveniently fit their ideology, and, more recently, social media’s propensity to spread falsehoods all create a fundamental weakness in our civil society. They aren’t confused; they don’t misunderstand science or freely accessible truths. They have financial incentives to obscure those realities, and they do not care what they destroy in the process. Our democracy is now straining under the weight of these attacks. When lies repeatedly affect the same segments of the population (and no group is immune) those absorbing this toxicity become distrustful of facts from reputable sources while latching onto even the most   conspiracy theories that conform to their worldviews. This political misinformation is so powerful that people have refused access to medical care because they were frightened by lies they had heard about Obamacare. So when Trump refers to, without basis in fact, “the millions of people who voted illegally,” his supporters believe his word over any actual authority on the subject  —   and he knows it."
142312,217738,"The holidays aren’t a big, happy family celebration for everyone. And that’s okay.",Washington Post,Katrina Woznicki,2016-12-13,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161218010609/https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2016/12/13/the-holidays-arent-a-big-happy-family-celebration-for-everyone-and-thats-okay/
","     While opening Halloween candy, my    daughter asked, “Is anyone coming for Thanksgiving?” Not “who” is coming over, but whether anyone would join us at all. “Just the three of us,” I said, cheerfully. She was quiet, thoughtfully chewing a   chocolate. “And Christmas?” she asked. “Just the three of us in Florida,” I said, and then to sweeten the deal, “presents by the pool!” She smiled. We go through this every year as soon as the detritus of Halloween is swept away, this   holiday season marathon where everyone else has grandparents flying in, aunts and uncles an hour’s drive away, cousins to play and fight with, houses filling up with love and chaos, or at least chaos. At least that’s how it is in our leafy, affluent suburb where many nuclear families are not only still intact but thriving, with functional extended family relationships. One neighbor’s   father paints her house; another grandpa shows up for his grandson’s science fair and geography bee. Cousins visit for sleepovers. Relatives are visible, present in the rhythms of everyday life. My daughter quickly realized our situation was quite different, our holidays much quieter. My husband is an only child, and both his parents are deceased. His cousins are scattered across the country, and sometimes we visit them, but they have their own families. My side is more complicated. My parents and brother, my only sibling, are alive and living in different states. I’m not close to any of them, but this is my choice. There’s a long history of mental illness, trauma, abuse and anger. I grew up in a house where everyone yelled and bedroom doors were often closed. My parents divorced when I was 14. When I was 19, my father, who has bipolar disorder, took me to court because he didn’t want to continue paying child support for me, a fact that has stumped every therapist I have ever talked to. I missed college classes to give depositions. I stopped speaking to him in 1992, when I was first served papers. My mother and I have always had a cold, distant relationship that, at its best, could be occasionally perfunctory. She made harsh remarks about me and to me that I try to forget. My brother was diagnosed with bipolar disorder more than a decade ago and has his own anger and challenges to manage.  When our daughter was born, we tried family   with my mother and my brother’s family so she could get to know her cousins. These visits usually ended with me and my husband feeling utterly drained. When our daughter was in elementary school, she started asking uncomfortable questions about the family dynamics she witnessed. My husband and I decided enough was enough. If I wanted a life free of bitterness, if I wanted to protect my daughter from generations of dysfunction, teach her healthier behaviors and surround her with more positive role models, then we’d have to go it alone. There was no argument over the phone, no terse emails, no nothing. Just a quiet parting of ways, an unspoken decision to focus on a future free of vitriol and resentment. It’s a choice I’m proud of every single day. Every therapist I’ve ever met has advised  —   sometimes even exuberantly encouraged  —   distance. One even told me, “You escaped a burning house,” and I long thought this succinctly captured my experience. We’ve achieved stability, success; our house is filled with humor, and our daughter easily jokes with my husband and me all the time, a sign that she feels safe. We hug daily. No one shouts. No one emotionally manipulates one another. Bedroom doors remain open. I built the calm, loving household I never had. But then I look at her, our only child, knowing she feels lonely at holidays, that she believes she’s missing out on something that comes so readily to everyone else she knows at school. Norman Rockwell images of large, smiling families gathered around a Christmas tree are deeply ingrained into our holiday mythology, which holds that every Dec. 25, parents and grandparents and siblings put differences aside and band together like the closing scene of “It’s a Wonderful Life. ” We have a large circle of friends, and each year, we attend a neighborhood Festivus party so that our daughter experiences a bustling house rocking with holiday cheer. Then Christmas arrives, and, understandably, people turn to their blood relatives to celebrate. Over the years, I’ve tried to create different Christmas memories. In 2008, we spent Christmas in Bruges, Belgium, a medieval city of gingerbread houses that looks like a greeting card. The following year, we went to London and cocooned in pubs with glowing fires. In 2013, we spent an extraordinary Christmas in Taos, N. M. We attended Christmas Eve Mass at the San Geronimo Chapel, built in the missionary style and completed in 1850, and then joined hundreds of strangers in a procession involving a priest and parishioners carrying a statue of the Virgin Mary out toward bonfires three stories high. This year, we’re snowbirding on Florida’s Gulf Coast for some sand and surf and, yes, some Disney World.  Our Christmases may appear nomadic and lacking in tradition, but my hope is to teach our daughter that Christmas or any holiday doesn’t need to fit a conventional mold  —   that it is more than blood relations bearing gifts and decorated evergreen boughs and hot cocoa with marshmallows. Those things are wonderful, but not everyone has them. Not all families work out. Sometimes you have to forge your own circle or find other circles with which to share the joy and compliments of the holiday season, and that’s okay. Parents often try to picture their children’s futures. I look at my daughter and wonder if she’ll marry into the large, noisy family she never had  —   that, like me, she’ll create what she felt was missing. Or maybe she’ll decide that Christmases on beaches, in the mountains or in charming European villages were fun and full of freedom, discovery and hope, and she’ll continue on the path we found together. Whatever she chooses, she is growing up happy, healthy, and willing to trust  —   neither angry nor afraid."

","  CHAPPAQUA, N. Y.  —   The other day, Carol Meyer and her friend Ellen went walking in the woods of Chappaqua. For all they knew, they might see a coyote or some rare mushrooms or Hillary Clinton. “I just have a sense  —   ” said Ellen, putting on her gloves. “You think so?” said Carol, adjusting her scarf. A Clinton sighting was hardly unlikely. She and her husband were Chappaqua neighbors who enjoyed an invigorating,   tromp in the local nature preserve as much as anyone else. And now, of course, she was back in town. Ellen had already seen her in the woods twice since she lost the presidency, and she wasn’t the only one. Two days after the election, a young woman had spotted Clinton and taken a photo with her that went viral, leading to fake news stories alleging that the whole thing was staged, which was said to prove once again that Hillary Clinton couldn’t do anything that did not strike a false note. But Chappaquaians knew better. “Of Course Hillary Clinton Was Hiking The Day After She Lost the Election You        ” wrote one Chappaqua native blogging in defense of the young woman in the photo, who had received hate mail afterward, which was why Ellen and others did not want their full names made public. “It’s not uncommon to run into the Clintons in the nature preserves, or even on the road. ” In fact, photos had been popping up all over in recent weeks showing a   Clinton smiling with strangers in the pines, so many that “Saturday Night Live” did a skit called “The Hunt for Hil,” in which two investigators head off into the woods to “find her, trap her, and thank her” with the help of a forest shaman. Others scrutinizing the photos noted that in one, Clinton appeared to be wearing the same   Patagonia fleece she had been photographed wearing in outings for 20 years, spawning jokes that her fleece had more experience than Donald Trump, and comments about how regular she seemed, how human. It was like Al Gore growing a beard after his 2000 election loss. Or George W. Bush painting   after leaving office. It was Hillary Clinton in the woods: not a candidate running, but a person walking, and probably also talking, as Ellen and Carol were doing now, two lawyers heading along a grassy path into the   preserve. “I read this article by Michael Kinsley  —   he was saying Donald Trump is a fascist, but not in the usual sense,” Ellen began, and as they walked along, the words “corporate statism” and “Tillerson” and “democracy” drifted up into the maples and pines. They huffed up a rocky hill and walked along a ridge. They eased down into a clearing by a   stream, which was where, two days after the election, Ellen had been walking her yellow lab Phoebe, distraught over the results and saying to herself, “If I see her, I see her” when she actually saw her, in the woods: Hillary Clinton coming around a bend. “Bill was in front,” Ellen said. “And then here came Hillary with her poodle and then the agents. And I’m here, and then we were together, and I just said, ‘What happened?’ And she said, ‘I don’t know. I have no idea.’ And I said, ‘I really admire you. You look great. You’re wonderful.’ I stood there with my arms wide open and I’m not even a hugger and I gave her this big hug. She had on a beautiful sweater. She asked my dog’s name. ” A couple weeks later, Ellen, who calls herself “the Sacagawea of the Arboretum,” let Phoebe off her leash. The dog was bounding ahead full speed when she started barking, and then Hillary and Bill Clinton appeared again, this time with their daughter, Chelsea, Chelsea’s husband and their children. It was the day after Thanksgiving and soon, other hikers were popping out of the woods. “I had already hugged her so I just said hello and patted her on the arm,” Ellen said. “Don’t ask me why. ” It was cold and quiet now except for the wind blowing through the bare branches of trees, and the sound of something rustling in the leaves. The women carried on deeper into the woods, bending back twigs, heading up a slope they called “Secret Service Hill” after a time years ago when the path was frozen and they had helped the Clintons’ agents, who were wearing loafers, navigate the incline. The Clintons were well shod. “It was a snowy February day,” Carol recalled. “They were holding hands. ” Ellen remembered Bill talking during his convention speech this summer about how he and Hillary had taken a walk on their first date and had been “walking and talking” ever since. Sometimes, though, it was just Bill walking alone in the woods as Hillary traipsed around the world or campaigned across the country. Once, a Chappaquaian named Judy Fuhrer was driving along the road by the preserve, listening to an audio recording of Bill Clinton’s   memoir. She said she was on the 13th CD when she realized that the tall   man walking his dog up ahead was the former president of the United States. “I stopped and got out of my car and said, ‘I’m listening to your autobiography right now!’ And he said, ‘You listened to the whole thing?! Whoa!’ And I said, ‘I listened to Hillary’s too.’ And he said, ‘Well, that’s more interesting.’ He asked me if I wanted him to sign [the CD] but I told him it was a library copy. ” Once, a Chappaquaian named Lew was coming out of the woods with his dog Maggie when he saw Bill Clinton and the dog heading in. “He said, ‘What’s it like in there today?’ ” Lew recalled. “I said, ‘It’s actually pretty muddy.’ He was complaining he didn’t have on the right boots. ” It seemed like almost every Chappaquaian had some story about the time they ran into the former most powerful man in the world. They had chatted with him in the woods about Nelson Mandela’s birthday party, or at Le Jardin Du Roi bistro about the lost chance for a Middle East peace deal. When Judy Fuhrer’s son broke his arm, Clinton signed the boy’s cast. Ellen ran into him in the bookstore once and handed him her cellphone to wish her    a happy birthday, and he had seemed glad to oblige. Hillary Clinton sightings were less frequent. “Sometimes she was here on a Saturday or Sunday afternoon, in casual clothes, just like the rest of us,” said Carol, stepping over some rocks. “She’d always comment on it being a nice day, I think so you’d feel comfortable because sometimes it can be intimidating, you know, meeting a former president and, at that time, a secretary of state. ” Now it was different. Now it seemed like Hillary Clinton might appear at any moment, like she was just up ahead, just beyond those trees. Recently, a Chappaquaian named Andy and his two dogs, Lucas and Earl, were out walking and noticed that the leaves normally covering the path appeared to have been cleared by a leaf blower, the first time he had ever seen such a thing. In the distance, he saw two men sitting too stiffly on a bench. “I said, ‘This is odd.’ It’s more like ‘Deliverance,’ ” he said, referring to the movie. “I tried to hustle up with the boys, and that night, my wife showed me the picture. ” A picture of Hillary Clinton in the woods. He had just missed her. “I’d be interested to see her and chat,” he said, figuring it would happen sooner or later, which was what Carol and Ellen figured too. They ducked under the limbs of two skinny trees that arched over the path, and after a while, there was a rustling noise, and the sound of people talking in the distance. It was a Saturday afternoon; Ellen had almost always seen her in the afternoon. She had seen Bill at the Starbucks earlier. Maybe she was back. They pressed on, but soon the sounds vanished, and there was just the woods. “The Cathedral of Firs,” Ellen said, reaching her favorite part of the hike, a swath of evergreens. They stopped and looked around. You could hear a bird or two. You could hear the creak of branches in the wind. They tried to imagine what Hillary would be doing next. “I think of her as someone who wants to be out doing things, having a goal,” Carol said. “My niece wants me to invite her to join my book club,” Ellen said, and as they headed into a clearing, the two friends talked about how they had solved all the world’s problems in the woods, even if they had yet to solve their own grief over the election. Seeing Hillary Clinton out here in nature helped, even if it was also unsettling. “It kind of brings it all home  —   like, oh. Wait. That’s who lost,” Carol said, and soon, they reached the last part of their hike, a path winding through a marshy area of low shrubs with long yellowy leaves. The leaves looked like uncombed yellowy hair. That was what they saw now, not Hillary. "

"," Football players at the University of Minnesota ended their   protest Saturday morning and dropped their threat to boycott the team’s postseason bowl game over concerns about the school’s treatment of 10 suspended teammates.   The players made the announcement with Gophers Coach Tracy Claeys and other members of the coaching staff looking on. “After many, many hours of discussion within our team and after speaking with President [Eric] Kaler, it became clear that our original request of having 10 suspensions overturned was not going to happen,” senior wide receiver Drew Wolitarsky said, reading from a prepared statement. Wolitarsky said that the team would immediately resume its preparations for the Holiday Bowl, scheduled to be played Dec. 27 in San Diego.  “This is an educational moment,” Mark Coyle, the school’s athletic director, said Saturday. “The great thing about college campuses is you can have different opinions. You can express those opinions. But you have to be respectful during that process. Again, this is a learning experience for all of us. ”  The players boycotted football activities, including practices, for two days to protest the treatment of the 10 Gophers players who were suspended and face further disciplinary action for their roles in an alleged sexual assault. That discipline followed an investigation by the school’s Office of Equal Opportunity and Affirmative Action into an incident from earlier in the semester. A female student said that as many as a dozen men took part in a sexual assault Sept. 2 at the   apartment of one of the football players, according to police reports. Five Minnesota players told police they had consensual sex with the woman. Though the players ultimately faced no criminal charges, the school inquiry resulted in the recommendation of expulsion for five of the players,   suspensions for four of them and probation for a 10th. All were suspended pending hearings and an appeals process. “We made a   decision,” Kaler said Saturday. “The athletic director made a decision. I supported that decision based on our values and what we think is right. That’s what we did. Part of the consequences of decisions is that sometimes people become unhappy. ” Players learned of the punishments Tuesday and met with athletic department administrators Wednesday. Unhappy with the explanations they had received, players announced a   boycott of all football activities Thursday and skipped practice both that day and Friday.  “We are disappointed at the lack of communication from the administration and their unwillingness to share information about the decision under the cover of student privacy,” Wolitarsky said Saturday. “We also understand that they have requirements that they need to follow about sharing information. Yet at the same time, we observed how our teammates’ names and pictures were shared with the world and their reputations were ruined. ” The players backed away from their initial demands, which included calling for the reinstatement of their teammates and for Kaler and Coyle to be “held accountable for their actions. ” Kaler made clear to them that reinstating the players was not an option.  “One of my jobs as President is to put our institutional values at the forefront of all we do and ensure our actions are aligned with those values,” he said in a statement Friday night. “This principle is far more important than any football game and the University community as a whole, and it is more important than any single athletic team. ” Kaler was apparently prepared for the Gophers to skip the Holiday Bowl, saying that the school would “not change our values or our code of conduct for the sake of a bowl game. ”  The school president also said that the team had declined his initial invitation for a meeting, but the players did finally meet with him and Coyle on Friday night. Kaler said it was a “frank and candid discussion. ” “I listened to their concerns,” he said. “I think I was able to explain our point of view around the actions that we took. ”   Wolitarsky said Saturday that the administration told players their 10 suspended teammates would each receive a fair hearing, “which includes a diverse review panel. ” “I’ve learned a lot from these past couple of days. There are no right choices. There are no decisions that do not affect somebody else,” Wolitarsky said. “This process has been extremely difficult. I’m sure, as you all know, how stressful this has been for everybody involved. ” The Gophers could resume practices immediately. They are scheduled to leave town next week for the Holiday Bowl, in which they will face Washington State.  Wolitarsky said that the entire experience had reinforced what Gopher football meant to the larger community. “As a team, we understand that what has occurred these past few days and playing football for the University of Minnesota is much larger than us,” he said. “So many people before us have given so much here, and this football team  —   so many coaches, staff, administration, professors, alumni, fans and our community have invested heavily in the success of our program. We will not  —   and we recognize we must not  —   let those people down. ” The players said that parts of their initial statement were misconstrued, and Saturday morning they made sure to condemn sexual violence against women. “There is only one acceptable way to treat all women, and that is with the utmost respect at all times,” Wolitarsky said.

142315,217741,"Was Anne Frank’s family betrayed? After 72 years, historians have a new theory.",Washington Post,Cleve R. Wootson Jr.,2016-12-17,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161218010609/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2016/12/17/was-anne-franks-family-betrayed-after-72-years-historians-have-a-new-theory/
","     For two years, Anne Frank’s family hid in secret rooms in Amsterdam, knowing that a curtain left open by mistake, a wayward noise or a nervous conspirator’s phone call to the Nazis could land them all in concentration camps. The worst happened on a summer day in 1944, when investigators discovered their secret world behind a movable bookcase and rounded them up. Of the eight Jewish people seized, seven died before the Holocaust was over, including Anne, whose diary was a testament to the horrors of the Nazi regime. She died of typhus at age 15 at   camp in Germany. For decades, Anne’s father, Otto, tried to figure out who tipped off the Nazis  —   a question historians have debated for 72 years. Now, the Anne Frank House museum in Amsterdam has put forth a new theory: It was a coincidence. For decades, the common theory has been that Anne Frank’s family was betrayed, possibly by a new employee at her father’s business or a conspirator’s wife, unsympathetic to the plight of the eight Jews. But according to a research paper published this month by the Anne Frank House, “this explicit focus on betrayal, however, limits the perspective of the arrest.   …     [O]ther scenarios tend to be overshadowed. ”  Previous theories were based on Otto Frank’s suspicions, which centered on Willem van Maaren, a new employee who hadn’t been let in on the secret about the hiding place. “We suspected him all along,” Frank told a Dutch newspaper in 1963. On its website, the museum says van Maaren was an inquisitive type who became suspicious and “laid a trap in the warehouse once: on the corners of the tables there are sheets of paper which fall off when you walk past. ” Still, no conclusive evidence has ever come to light of van Maaren alerting authorities, the paper says. Through the decades, others have been identified as potential betrayers, including Dutch National Socialist Tonny Ahlers, as well as the wife of an employee who helped Anne’s family hide. But no one has cast serious doubts about the betrayal theory  —   until now. In part, that is because historians believed the three investigators who found the Jews hiding in the Opekta building were members of the Sicherheitsdienst, which tracked down potential enemies of Hitler’s Nazi regime.   #FactOfTheDay #WednesdayWisdom #AnneFrank pic. twitter.   —   Anne Frank Trust (@AnneFrankTrust) July 27, 2016   But new information uncovered by researchers showed the three men Otto Frank later identified as the investigators weren’t looking for enemies of Nazis, but were likely assigned to track down people committing ration card fraud or dodging service in the military  —   not hunting down Jews. Gezinus Gringhuis, for example, had previously been assigned to track down Jews, but had a new assignment  —   “investigating economic violations,” according to the research paper. In her diary, Anne repeatedly wrote about the arrests of men who had been caught dealing in illegal ration cards “so we have no coupons. ” Such arrests were often reported to authorities, who frequently came across hiding Jews as they tried to sniff out people with phony ration cards. The research paper also highlights other circumstantial evidence that pokes holes in the betrayal theory. Many phone lines were cut off, for example, which would make it hard for civilians to call authorities about Jews in hiding. “This creates a real possibility that the call, if it actually took place, came from another government agency,” the paper says. The paper stressed that there is no conclusive theory about how Anne’s family was discovered  —   including its own hypothesis. “In any case, the Anne Frank House’s investigative report indicates that more was going on in the building (than) only people being hidden there,” it says. “The possibility of betrayal has of course not been entirely ruled out by this.   …     Clearly, the last word about that fateful summer day in 1944 has not yet been said. ”  The interest in the betrayal of a teenage girl seven decades after her death is a testament to the universality of Anne’s powerful tale. Many have pointed out the historical similarities between the plight of Anne’s family and the current debate about Syrians seeking refuge in the United States. As The Washington Post’s Elahe Izadi wrote, the Franks collided with restrictive policies designed to protect national security and guard against an influx of foreigners during [a] time of war. ” The Franks were unable to immigrate to the United States and instead lived in a hidden storeroom. And a    Syrian girl, Bana   has been called a   Anne Frank, according to The Post’s Caitlin Gibson. Bana amassed 200, 000 Twitter followers while documenting her family’s struggle to survive in   Aleppo.

","     Noe Lopez needed a favor. It was early December, and the U. S. Border Patrol agent working on the San   border asked a   whether they could switch patrol areas for the day. She would take whatever area Lopez was assigned, and he would spend the day in a desolate, isolated area known as “S —   Bridge. ” Court documents don’t detail what Lopez told the woman to persuade her to switch, but he likely kept the real reason a secret: He was expecting a package. On Dec. 6, Lopez got in his Border Patrol vehicle, headed out to the designated location and picked up a black backpack weighing six pounds, according to a criminal complaint filed in U. S. District Court in the Southern District of California. The backpack traveled from Lopez’s Border Patrol vehicle to the back of his GMC Yukon to a strip mall in Chula Vista, Calif. court documents say. There, the FBI says, Lopez met with a man who paid the Border Patrol agent to become a drug smuggler. The price: $500 a pound, or $3, 000  —   and the promise of future work. Lopez handed over the backpack, and the men made plans for another drop the next day  —   more drugs and a bigger payday for Lopez. Lopez pulled out his phone and showed the contact where seven kilograms of cocaine should be dropped the following day, court documents say. The place was nicknamed “Goat Canyon” by Border Patrol agents.  Before he left, Lopez said he would mark the area where the drugs should be dropped with a Coke bottle. But days later, he would be in handcuffs, charged with attempted distribution of methamphetamine, attempted distribution of cocaine and receiving a bribe by a public official. Lopez’s contact in the smuggling operation was working as a confidential informant for the FBI. Lopez made his first court appearance Thursday. In all, court documents say, Lopez accepted $10, 000 to smuggle what he thought were drugs, which turned out to be fake meth and cocaine. On Tuesday, a judge will determine whether Lopez is eligible for bail while he awaits trial. It was unclear whether Lopez had hired an attorney. A woman who identified herself as his   told Philadelphia   WCAU that Lopez might have had money problems. Still, the allegations surprised her. “Everyone has money issues. We live in San Diego, but I mean, nothing to this extreme for someone to risk their career,” she said. Chief Patrol Agent Richard A. Barlow said in a statement that the Border Patrol is cooperating with investigating agencies. “Border Patrol agents are held to the highest standards, and we remain committed to performing our duties for the American people in the most professional way,” he said.  Lopez became a Border Patrol agent a decade ago, as a massive hiring spree led to a spike in the number of agents charged with corruption, according to the Associated Press. An independent task force examining the Border Patrol found that the agency’s system for disciplining corrupt agents and officers does little to deter criminal wrongdoing, according to the Los Angeles Times. The “discipline system is broken, “the report concluded. “Such corrupt officials can assist the (drug) cartels by providing intelligence and facilitating the movement of large amounts of contraband across our borders and into our country,” the Homeland Security Advisory Council’s final report on Border Patrol integrity concluded. “Indeed, corrupt CBP law enforcement personnel pose a national security threat. ” Lopez is the third federal agent arrested on corruption charges since September, according to the San Diego  . In September, Customs and Border Protection Officer Jose Luis Cota, who ran a lane at the San Ysidro Port of Entry, was arrested after authorities say he continually let a woman smuggle unauthorized immigrants through his lane in exchange for cash bribes and sex, according to the newspaper. And on Nov. 30, Tyrone Duren, a former Homeland Security Investigations agent, was arrested on suspicion of stealing drug money from traffickers and laundering the cash.

"," Four people were killed and dozens more were injured in vehicle wrecks across the Washington region early Saturday as winter’s first blast of precipitation covered the area in a sheet of ice, crippling roadways and grounding flights at local airports. Though Maryland and Virginia transportation crews   highways and major roadways to thwart icing, officials said a steady stream of freezing rain fell longer than expected, outlasting the salt and other treatments applied to roads before and during the storm. Stretches of the Beltway and Interstate 95 were closed for hours. “After a while the salt becomes diluted,” said Charlie Gischlar, spokesman for the Maryland Department of Transportation. “People travel too fast for the conditions, and once you lose control, that’s it. ” Gischlar said the weather also stayed cooler longer than expected, making conditions more challenging. Rather than freezing rain giving way to regular rain that would melt the ice, he said, “it matured into a   ice storm. ”       (Reuters)   Even   more than 5, 000 miles of roadways and continuously salting, as Virginia did, couldn’t hold off dangerous conditions. “When it comes to ice and when the temps are very, very low, the roads will refreeze really quickly,” said Jennifer McCord, spokeswoman for the Virginia Department of Transportation.  The most serious incident was in Baltimore, where 55 cars piled up on Interstate 95 after a tanker truck went off the highway and burst into flames early Saturday. Two people died and at least 12 others were transported to local hospitals, according to Baltimore fire officials. A video of the scene posted by a bystander on Facebook showed a large tanker truck careen down the road, then spin onto its side and over the   barrier of the highway overpass. The tanker caught fire as it fell, exploding into a giant plume of flames and smoke.  Officials said the tanker driver was killed, as well as another driver who was hit by debris. In Northern Virginia, 23 vehicles piled up on the Beltway near mile marker 50 in Fairfax just after 5 a. m. A short time later, about a mile away, a man’s body was found on the highway shoulder. Authorities said it appeared the man was involved in the wreck and had walked away, though it was unclear how he died. A fourth person was struck and killed by a   near the Bayview area of Baltimore at about 5 a. m. Police do not yet know why the person was not in a vehicle.  By the time the storm moved out of the region around lunch time, officials had reported hundreds of wrecks from Baltimore down through Northern Virginia. Dozens of cars from the tanker accident and   pileup in Baltimore still had not been removed. Meanwhile, airports scrambled to get passengers in the air  —   or, in some cases, back on the ground  —   after closing runways in the morning.  Dulles International Airport opened two runways by around 10 a. m.   International Marshall Airport was reporting lengthy delays through the morning. Ronald Reagan National Airport reported “fairly normal” operations but told passengers on social media to “expect some delays as planes line up to   before takeoff. ” Those who weren’t stranded in traffic jams were stranded in the air. Through the miracle of   WiFi, they kept track of the ice disruptions from above. After Dulles Airport tweeted that frequent status updates would be posted online, David Ramadan, a former state House delegate in Virginia, responded, “Those of us circling above would appreciate direct updates. ” Ramadan was apparently trying to get home from Dubai. Low on fuel, his plane was diverted to Pittsburgh for a   he later tweeted. Back in the air, Ramadan noticed the airport tweet that operations were returning to normal. “You better keep the runways open,” he replied. “We’re coming in! !” Bus service closures left many without a way to work. Youth sports games were canceled. In the District, even a holiday cookie decorating event in Chevy Chase and a 5K “Ugly Sweater Run” were not spared. But as morning gave way to afternoon, the worst was passed. “Winter weather advisories were allowed to expire at noon in the local area,” the Capital Weather Gang reported. “Temperatures are now at or above freezing from the   corridor and to the southeast. ” By midnight, the forecast called for temperatures in the 50s. rachel. weiner@washpost. com "

"," Lost sleep, low energy, lagging libido. Those are among the health problems that we often consider a given as we get older. But new research shows they don’t always have to be part and parcel of aging. Consumer Reports debunks some common myths about the health problems that may affect you as you age: You’ll sleep poorly Sleep patterns do change as we age. “It takes longer to fall asleep, and you tend to have   awakenings than younger individuals,” says Raj Dasgupta, a sleep specialist at the University of Southern California. You also get less delta  —   or    —   sleep. That deeper stage helps you consolidate memory. And without enough sleep, you feel more tired, irritable and forgetful during the day.  But many sleep problems common among older people stem from other causes, notably medication used to treat unrelated health conditions. For example, diuretics taken to lower blood pressure or treat heart failure can cause you to wake up frequently during the night to go to the bathroom.   What you should do: First, ask yourself whether you’re bothered by your changing sleep pattern. If you’re unhappy with it, ask your doctor whether any drug you take or underlying health problem could be affecting your sleep. If those possibilities are ruled out, consider cognitive behavioral therapy.   Watch out for: Sleeping pills, which can pose such risks as   grogginess, confusion and memory problems.  You’ll become frail and prone to falling About   of people older than 65 fall every year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That’s due in part to a natural decrease in blood flow to the cerebellum  —   the brain’s balancing center  —   as well as   and vision changes that make it more difficult to orient yourself, says Mary Tinetti, chief of geriatrics at the Yale School of Medicine.   What you should do: Check your balance and strength. “I stress to all my patients that even at age 75 they should be able to get up from a chair without using the arms, walk across the room, turn quickly and sit down without any unsteadiness,” Tinetti says. If you can’t, see your doctor, who can check for underlying conditions that can affect balance (a vitamin B12 deficiency, a slow heart rate or cataracts, for example).   Watch out for: Blood pressure meds. They sometimes lower your blood pressure too much, causing dizziness when you stand and increasing the risk of falls. You will lose interest in sex For women, levels of both estrogen and testosterone have declined by menopause, which can lower the sex drive and make sex physically uncomfortable. Many older men still have a strong sex drive, but they may have erection problems because of low blood flow to the penis as a result of clogged arteries stemming from such conditions as high cholesterol and blood pressure levels. Despite those changes, “as people are living longer, healthier lives, they have all the same expectations that they have in their younger years, which includes sexuality,” says Marc Agronin, medical director of mental health and clinical research at Miami Jewish Health Systems.   What you should do: If you’re unhappy with your sex life (and not everyone with diminished sexual interest is) talk with your physician. He should check for conditions, such as diabetes, that can affect arousal. You should also be screened for mood disorders.  Watch out for: A jump to medication. More men and even some women are being prescribed testosterone, but taking supplemental doses of it is no magical cure. Prescription drugs to treat erectile dysfunction, including sildenafil (Viagra) and tadalafil (Cialis) can help some men. But they can also cause such side effects as dizziness, headaches and blurred vision.  Your mind will deteriorate “As part of   ‘normal’ aging, your mind does slow a bit,” says Ronald Petersen, a neurologist at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn. Brain neurochemicals change over time, he says, which explains the little glitches, such as forgetting where you put your keys. But only up to 20 percent of people experience   problems with thinking or memory, studies suggest.   What you should do: Make sure your doctor screens for high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, obesity, sleep apnea and depression  —   untreated, they can cause cognitive changes  —   and for hearing and vision loss.  Watch out for: Antihistamines such as diphenhydramine (Benadryl Allergy, Nytol, Sominex and related generics)   drugs such as diazepam (Valium and generics) and antidepressants such as amitriptyline. They have been linked to cognitive impairment and dementia.  You’ll be lonely, depressed Older people are no more likely than younger ones to be depressed, says Robert Roca, chairman of the American Psychiatric Association’s Council on Geriatric Psychiatry. But when they do become depressed, “usually it stems from a loss associated with growing older,” Roca explains. “They lose loved ones or friends, they lose their identity because they retire, their physical vigor declines and they can’t do as many activities as they used to. ”  What you should do: Ask your doctor to screen for depression. If you’re mildly depressed, increasing your physical and social activities can help, Roca says.   Watch out for:   medications. Some doctors prescribe them to treat depression, but this class of drugs, known as benzodiazepines, isn’t appropriate for that purpose.    Copyright 2016. Consumers Union of United States Inc.

142319,217746,Watch: Mysterious ghost shark captured on camera for the first time,Washington Post,Amy B Wang,2016-12-17,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161218010609/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/speaking-of-science/wp/2016/12/17/watch-mysterious-ghost-shark-captured-on-camera-for-the-first-time/
","         Like its Greek mythological namesake, the chimaera  —   or “ghost shark”  —   is a mysterious, rarely seen creature with a patchwork of bizarre features. Dwelling in the depths of the ocean, its eyes are pale and seemingly dead. Where teeth should be, the ghost shark uses tooth plates instead to grind food. Their heads are lined with cryptic dots, like the remnant scars of ancient stitches. Male chimaeras have retractable sex organs  —   on their foreheads. Its other nicknames  —   ratfish, rabbitfish, spookfish  —   hint at how bizarre chimaeras are in appearance. And now, scientists believe they have captured on video a species of ghost shark that had never before been filmed live: the   blue chimaera. The actual video was taken in 2009 but was only recently released by the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute, along with a paper by researcher Lonny Lundsten and his colleagues at the institute. Six years ago, researchers from the nonprofit sent an ROV, or remotely operated vehicle, on several dives off the waters of central California and Hawaii. The ROVs captured footage from depths of up to 6, 700 feet. What they returned with surprised researchers: On film was what appeared to be a species of ghost shark previously only caught in the southwestern Pacific Ocean.  According to his paper, Lundsten consulted with three chimaera experts who watched the video from the diving expeditions. All believed the fish was, in fact, a   blue chimaera. Still, Lundsten and others from the Monterey Bay Aquarium institute can’t be 100 percent certain that the fish captured on video is a   blue chimaera, despite their similar physical characteristics. Because of that, the paper refers to the fish they recorded as Hydrolagus cf. trolli, rather than its scientific name, Hydrolagus trolli. To be absolutely sure, researchers would have to capture the ghost shark and bring it back to the surface, the institute said. “This is much easier said than done, because these fish are generally too large, fast, and agile to be caught,” the institute notes. “If and when the researchers can get their hands on one of these fish, they will be able to make detailed measurements of its fins and other body parts and perform DNA analysis on its tissue. ” Doing so would either allow them to remove the “cf. ” from the species description  —   or lead to perhaps an even more exciting alternative: that they discovered a new species of ghost shark.  “If these animals turn out to be the same species as the ghost sharks recently identified off California, it will be further evidence that, like many   animals, the   blue chimaera can really get around,” the institute said. The   blue chimaera was first discovered by researcher Dominique Didier Dagit in 2002, in the deep waters around Australia, New Zealand and New Caledonia. Dagit, then an assistant curator of ichthyology at the Academy of Natural Sciences in Philadelphia, told the Associated Press in 2002 that she named her discovery Hydrolagus trolli after Alaskan artist Ray Troll because they shared a love for ratfish. ’’It’s kind of nice to be able to name a species for someone,’’ Dagit told the AP. ’’I thought, ’Here’s my chance to name a fish for someone who’s really interested.’ . .. It kind of looks like him, [but with] less facial hair. ’’ Read more: A Japanese theme park thought it was a good idea to freeze 5, 000 dead fish in a skating rink Daniel the emotional support duck takes his first plane ride, soars in popularity Do shark attacks swing elections?"
142320,217747,My daughterâ€™s birth father suddenly wants to be in her life. Should we let him?,Washington Post,Meghan Leahy,2016-12-14,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161218010609/https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/on-parenting/my-daughters-birth-father-suddenly-wants-to-be-in-her-life-should-we-let-him/2016/12/13/2191d34e-bbeb-11e6-91ee-1adddfe36cbe_story.html
","  Q:  When I was 17, I hooked up with a boy at a party. We were both drunk and didn t use protection. This is how my amazing, adorable daughter came to be. When I wanted her biological father to take part in her life at the time, he refused. Since then, I ve moved on and married my wonderful husband of 10 years. Recently, my daughter s biological father reemerged to offer his apologies and ask whether he could be a part of her life. I ve asked my husband for advice, and he said that he is okay with it but that the choice is up to me. I feel that it would confuse and maybe even hurt my daughter to find out that the father she has known for years is not her real father. I m scared to death of anything bad happening to my daughter because of this. Any advice on how to deal with her biological father and break the news to her?   A: As scary and   as this all is, there is a lot of good news in your note. Let s review: 1. You clearly love your daughter to pieces, and you are married to a man who also loves her. 2. Your husband is supporting whatever you need to do, which is also a gift. 3. And although you may have wished your daughter s father to stay away forever, it is also good that he wishes to know her.  But nonetheless, you are in a real pickle. Even after you break the news to her about her biological father, there is going to be a cascade of emotions, which may last for a long time. She is not simply gaining a birth father; she is also finding out that her supposed birth father is her stepfather, and this could result in a loss of trust. At her age (assuming she s older than 10, which it sounds as though she might be) she is old enough to really consider these issues with rational thought. But her confusion will be acute and her anger will be justified. So how do you handle this with as much sensitivity as you can? Whenever adults are getting ready to reveal truths to children, they must meet among themselves to clarify their goals. If I could offer any advice that could be helpful, it would be to use an excellent   therapist to facilitate this process. A good therapist will help identify the role of each adult in the family and begin to clarify how the birth father can become a part of this unit. And while I (almost) always support birthparents  being in the picture, this father does not get to strut in with his objectives and have high expectations for how he will be received. If he really wants to be a part of his daughter s life, he will need to understand that it will be on her terms and her timeline. Period. A good therapist will clarify this, examine her developmental age and appropriate expectations, and examine how you and your husband really feel about this change.  Your husband says he supports the birth father s being in the family, but those emotions deserve a deeper dive. He has raised this girl her entire life, and he may feel his role is being altered or threatened. Those feelings deserve to be examined. You may have feelings of shame (teen pregnancy) guilt (maintaining a falsehood for a decade) and resentment (for the father s stepping out of the picture). These feelings are real, and if you are experiencing them, they need to be acknowledged. When I spoke with Kelly Theis from FamilyFirst Psychological Services in Vienna, she said something that puts things into perspective:  The mother and her husband have played roles for this girl that are not going to change even with this news. They are still the nurturers and providers that have been there for her since she was born. ? A good therapist will help all three of you prepare to tell your daughter this news. You don t want to build in drama and turn it into a scene from  General Hospital, ? but you want to use language and phrasing that is truthful, clear, complete, forthright and reassuring. Although the news will be jarring, Theis says,  the clearer they can be with the message and the more they can be on the same page, the better it will be for the daughter. ?  But this is only the beginning. After the news is broken, the real work begins. Keeping a good therapist in the loop will help this new family unit work through big emotions in a way that feels safe, honest and, most important, powerful for your daughter. If her life is going to be turned upside down (and it probably will be here) she deserves to have the necessary support to process this in her own time and in her own way. If your family uses a third party such as a therapist, feelings of resentment, pain, panic and fear will not cloud your perspectives. No matter what, Theis makes a key point when she says,  It s important to acknowledge that the biological father is an important piece of this girl s history and that whether or not he ultimately is actively involved in her life, it is important that she understand her history and background as well as possible. ? Like it or not, this man is her father, and as painful as this shock will be, there is great potential to having more loving adults in your daughter s life. That is a risk worth taking. Just proceed slowly and with support. Good luck. More from On Parenting:   How do we raise charitable children? A nonprofit founder (and dad) offers tips.

","      This, to me, is the ideal winter salad. It offers a light, crisp counterpoint to just about anything you might be stewing or roasting, but also the depth of flavor to stand up to those hearty dishes, and seasonal notes that feel right on a chilly night. It’s simple to make, which is why it is a weeknight staple in my home this time of year. It is also festive and enticing enough to serve as a starter for a holiday dinner, where it will set the right tone and rev your guests’ appetites without spoiling them for the main course. The salad itself has just four ingredients, and each can be varied based on your preferences or what you have at home. I use red leaf for its autumnal hue and yielding crispness, but green leaf, kale, spinach or escarole would also work well. Then there’s the fruit, cheese and nut trio of tastes and textures that make the salad so   good.  In this recipe, the combo is juicy slices of ripe pear, pungent blue cheese crumbles and buttery toasted pecans. But feel free to swap in another seasonal fruit, such as sliced apple, grapes or pomegranate; another cheese, such as feta or chevre; or a different nut, such as almonds or walnuts. The dressing, with its tang of Dijon mustard balanced by an earthy sweetness from maple syrup, is universal enough to work with any of those substitutions. And the salad itself will pair beautifully with most dishes you make throughout the holiday season.    food@washpost. com     Scale, print and rate the recipe in our Recipe Finder:    Green Salad With Pears, Pecans and Blue Cheese    4 servings  From nutritionist and cookbook author Ellie Krieger.

142323,217756,Kellyanne Conway: Electors’ concern over Russian hacking allegations is ‘nonsense’,Washington Post,Amy B Wang,2016-12-18,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161219001336/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/12/18/kellyanne-conway-electors-concern-over-russian-hacking-allegations-is-nonsense/
","         Kellyanne Conway, senior adviser to   Donald Trump, said Sunday on CBS that any concerns about Russia’s alleged interference with the 2016 presidential election were unfounded. “Where’s the evidence?” she asked “Face the Nation” host John Dickerson. Earlier this month, the CIA concluded in a secret assessment that Russia meddled in the election to help Trump win the presidency. FBI Director James B. Comey and Director of National Intelligence James R. Clapper Jr. agreed with the CIA’s assessment. The reports have prompted some electoral voters to call for an intelligence briefing on the extent of any Russian interference before the electoral college vote on Monday. John Podesta, former chairman of Hillary Clinton’s campaign, has publicly supported those electors’ demands. On Sunday, Conway dismissed such calls.   . @KellyannePolls responds to reports electoral voters troubled by Russian hacking. Says electors potentially undermining democracy pic. twitter.   —   Face The Nation (@FaceTheNation) December 18, 2016   “The entire nonsense about the electors trying to use the Russian hacking issue to change the election results is really unfortunate,” she told Dickerson. “I think that actually undermines our democracy more than any other conversation that we’re having right now. ”  Dickerson pressed Conway several times about whether Trump had evidence that Russians did not hack the election that would cause his stance to differ from that of the wider intelligence community. “The   receives intelligence briefings that I am not privy to,” Conway responded. She also suggested that President Obama’s recent tough talk on Russia came because he was “under political pressure” to do so. On Friday, Obama said the United States will retaliate against Russia “at a time and place of our own choosing” over its malicious cyber activities during the U. S. election. Dickerson asked whether Trump supported Obama’s approach, a question Conway did not directly address. “The   respects the ability of President Obama to do what he sees necessary in any number of different arenas,” Conway said. “It does seem to be a political response at this point, because it seems like the president is under pressure from Team Hillary, who can’t accept the election results. ” Trump has been criticized for his friendly posturing toward Russian President Vladimir Putin and has minimized the allegations that Russia interfered with the U. S. election. Like Conway, Trump’s surrogates have largely done the same, suggesting that reports from the intelligence community are an attempt to delegitimize Trump’s win. “I think [Trump] would accept the conclusion if they would get together, put out a report and show the American people they are on the same page,” Reince Priebus, chairman of the Republican National Committee and incoming White House chief of staff, said on “Fox News Sunday. ” Trump and his transition team’s stance on the issue is at odds with several members of the Republican Party.  Earlier this month, four   senators called for a thorough investigation of alleged Russian meddling in the election. Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain ( .) and Sen. Lindsey O. Graham ( . C.) joined incoming Senate Democratic leader Charles E. Schumer (N. Y.) and Armed Services ranking Democrat Jack Reed (R. I.) in issuing a bipartisan statement. “This cannot become a partisan issue,” the statement read in part. “The stakes are too high for our country. ” In a separate appearance Sunday on CNN’s “State of the Union,” McCain called for a select Senate committee to investigate Russia’s cyber activities during the election. McCain told host Jake Tapper that there was “no doubt” that Russia interfered  —   and that even if it would not have affected the outcome of the election, it was a serious matter. “I have seen no evidence that the election would have been different, but that doesn’t change the fact that the Russians and others  —   the Chinese, to a lesser degree  —   have been able to interfere with our electoral process,” McCain said. “If they are able to harm the electoral process, then they destroy democracy. ” Read more: McCain calls for committee to investigate Russia hacking: ‘There’s no doubt’ of interference Republicans ready to launch   probe of Russia, despite Trump’s stance On SNL, Trump gets a visit from the ghost of election past: Shirtless Vladimir Putin"
142324,217757,A new poll shows 52% of Republicans actually think Trump won the popular vote,Washington Post,Eric Oliver,2016-12-18,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161219001336/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2016/12/18/a-new-poll-shows-an-astonishing-52-of-republicans-think-trump-won-the-popular-vote/
","     Amid the speculation on whether the electoral college will refuse to make Donald Trump president, many Trump opponents are pinning their hopes on one glaring fact: Hillary Clinton’s sizable win in the popular vote. Clinton’s lead now exceeds 2. 8 million votes (more than 2. 1 percent of the total vote) and continues to grow. Many Democrats hope this fact alone might persuade Republican electors to reject Trump in favor of some alternative. But this hope faces a serious challenge: Half of all Republicans actually think Trump won the popular vote.      With criticism flying about the electoral college, here’s what you need to know about our system for electing the president and why the ”Hamilton electors” don’t like it. (Jenny   Washington Post)   In a nationally representative online survey of 1, 011 Americans conducted by Qualtrics between Dec. 6 and 12, we asked respondents, “In last month’s election, Donald Trump won the majority of votes in the electoral college. Who do you think won the most popular votes?”   percent said Donald Trump won the popular vote. This is a slightly larger proportion than in a recent Pew survey in which 19 percent said Trump won the popular vote. Respondents’ correct understanding of the popular vote depended a great deal on partisanship. A large fraction of Republicans  —   52 percent  —   said Trump won the popular vote, compared with only 7 percent of Democrats and 24 percent of independents. Among Republicans without any college education, the share was even larger: 60 percent, compared with 37 percent of Republicans with a college degree.       This same pattern of partisan bias didn’t emerge on other factual questions in our survey. For example, we asked respondents to estimate the size of the country’s African American and Latino populations. As is typical, people tended to overestimate the size of these groups: On average, respondents think 27 percent of Americans are black and 28 percent are Latino. (The correct answers as of 2015 are 13. 3 percent and 17. 6 percent.) But these numbers do not vary by party affiliation. Democrats and Republicans make similar guesses, on average. These results align with something social scientists have long recognized: We choose facts to be consistent with our prior beliefs. In this case, Republicans are more likely to endorse erroneous claims about Trump’s victory because it aligns with their partisanship. They do not, however, have any partisan motivation when estimating the size of minority groups. If the Republican electors are anything like the party rank and file, they may think voting for Trump is in line with the choices of the American people.      New polling shows that a majority of Americans disapprove of the idea of ”faithless electors” changing their votes in the Electoral College  —   and even Democrats aren’t that enthusiastic about it.

142325,217758,Congressional push for sanctions against Russia could set up clash with Trump,Washington Post,Karoun Demirjian,2016-12-18,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161219001336/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2016/12/18/congressional-push-for-sanctions-against-russia-could-set-up-clash-with-trump/
","         A showdown in Congress is looming over expanding sanctions against Russia, possibly pitting lawmakers once again against   Donald J. Trump and his secretary of state nominee who previously has opposed them. Sen. Lindsey Graham ( . C.) an outspoken Trump critic, is the latest lawmaker to join the fray, stating that his goal in a series of investigations next year “is to put on President Trump’s desk crippling sanctions against Russia,” he wrote on Twitter. “They need to pay a price. ” And on Sunday’s  “State of the Union” on CNN, Sen. John McCain ( .) the Armed Services Committee chair and a hardliner on Russia who believes that country hacked the election, called for a single select committee to investigate the alleged Russian meddling, as did incoming Senate Democratic leader Charles E. Schumer of New York. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell ( .) has rejected that approach.    Sen. Lindsey Graham ( . C.) right, pictured with Sen. John McCain ( .) left, is the latest lawmaker to call for expanding sanctions against Russia.   REYNOLDS  The list of lawmakers who have called for expanded Russia sanctions includes Republicans and Democrats, Trump critics and members who supported the Republican’s White House bid. Their reasons are many, including anger over Moscow’s alleged role in a series of   hacks to revulsion at the Kremlin’s support for Syrian President Bashar   torturing his own people. But even if Congress censures Russia with its strongest brand of sanctions, there is no guarantee that the Trump administration will actually implement them. “It’s certainly possible Trump might not implement them, but there is overwhelming bipartisan consensus in Congress that sanctions have worked on Russia for other issues, and will work again in the future,” said a Senate Democratic aide who was not authorized to speak publicly. “We’re hopeful the Trump team and the   himself will come to understand this. ” The United States has imposed sanctions against Russia since 2014 in response to the annexation of Crimea and Moscow’s support of separatists in eastern Ukraine. The measures, which restrict Russia’s financial, energy and defense sectors, depend largely on cooperation from the European Union, which voted this week to extend Ukraine sanctions against Russia for six months. Trump’s new pick for secretary of state, Exxon Mobil CEO Rex Tillerson, publicly opposed those sanctions, which Exxon estimates cost them over $1 billion in lost business. “We do not support sanctions, generally, because we don’t find them to be effective unless they are very well implemented comprehensibly and that’s a very hard thing to do,” Tillerson told an annual meeting of Exxon executives in 2014. It is unclear if Tillerson will continue to oppose sanctions if he is confirmed as secretary of state. The Trump transition team did not respond to an emailed question on the subject. Sanctions have emerged as a popular, relatively bloodless tool for the   Congress to address intractable international conflicts and threatening foreign regimes. In the last year alone, lawmakers passed congressional sanctions against North Korea and extended a comprehensive range of measures against Iran to preserve the option to reimpose sanctions if Tehran violates last year’s nuclear deal. President Obama allowed the   extension of the Iran Sanctions Act to become law last week without his signature, under apparent pressure from Iranian leaders and others who argued renewing the energy, trade, defense and banking sector restrictions would jeopardize the nuclear pact. The administration believed the president already had authority to sanction Iran in the event of any nuclear deal violations. All of this occurred even before the CIA’s assessment that Russia meddled in the U. S. elections in order to boost Trump  —   a conclusion Trump has called “ridiculous. ” Senior lawmakers and foreign policy leaders have vowed to aggressively investigate those claims and others regarding Russia in a series of probes in the new Congress. McConnell and House Speaker Paul Ryan ( .) have indicated a preference to conduct any   probes in their intelligence committees, where leaders are able to wield influence over what information is ultimately released to the public. President Obama suggested Friday that he was unlikely to answer calls from several top congressional Democrats to declassify all information pertaining to alleged Russian hacks before he leaves office. “We will provide evidence that we can safely provide that does not compromise sources and methods. But I’ll be honest with you, when you’re talking about cyber security a lot of it is classified,” Obama said. Efforts to investigate Russia’s alleged election interference and impose expanded sanctions against the Kremlin may run into resistance from the Trump administration. During his campaign, Trump took a decidedly softer stance toward the Kremlin, encouraging closer relations with Russian President Vladimir Putin and hiring a team of advisers on the same wavelength. The Trump team even worked behind the scenes at the Republican National Convention to maneuver the party platform away from language that would have called for maintaining or increasing sanctions against Russia over its meddling in Ukraine. But the clamor for more punitive measures has rising in Congress from corners of both parties. Lawmakers have pointed to the Iran and North Korea measures as a potential blueprint for Russia sanctions. And they’ve already made opening attempts to tighten the screws on Moscow. The House passed one measure this year that would come down on the Kremlin for its support of Syrian President Bashar   in a bill sanctioning entities that provide Syria’s government with financial, material or technological support. The effort is to “halt the wholesale slaughter of the Syrian people. ” Though the bill mentions Russia by name only once, there is little doubt that the Russian and Iranian regimes would be primarily impacted by it. Prior to the vote, House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Ed Royce ( .) said there was “unanimity of opinion” about the need for the sanctions, “regardless of people’s perception about a given regime, or how we approach the conundrum of Syria. ” In the Senate, top Foreign Relations Committee Democrat Ben Cardin ( .) has promised a bill to impose “sanctions, plus more than that” against Russia over cyber hacking activities, Ukraine involvement and bombing campaigns in Syria, which Secretary of State John Kerry has suggested amount to war crimes. “We expect it to be bipartisan,” Cardin said this month. The top House Intelligence Committee Democrat Adam Schiff (Calif.) has suggested the president should start considering options to use the authority he already has to sanction Russia over its alleged   hacking. But some powerful Republicans say the administration must do a better job restricting Putin with tools they already have. McCain says there has been “selective enforcement of sanctions imposed on Russia. ” But their efforts to expand punitive actions against Russia may be affected by probes of alleged election hacking. House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence Chairman Devin Nunes ( .) has accused the intelligence community of withholding information from Congress, charges sparked by Washington Post reports. In a statement Friday, Nunes promised his committee would visit the FBI, NSA, CIA and DIA in January “so members can further investigate this issue. ” Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Chairman Richard Burr ( . C.) also released a lengthy statement Friday outlining the committee’s plans to investigate all “cyber activity directed against our nation by the Russian government, both as it regards the 2016 Election and more broadly” and to “follow the intelligence wherever it leads. ” “We will conduct this review expeditiously, but we will take the time to get it right and will not be influenced by uninformed discourse,” Burr said in the statement."

","    On a warm September evening in Columbus, Ohio, panicked witnesses called police to report that a group of boys had robbed a man at gunpoint and fled into a maze of alleys and fences on the city’s east side. In the fading light, Officer Bryan Mason cornered two of the boys in an alley, where, according to police,    Tyre King pulled a gun from his waistband. Mason fired three rounds, striking the teen in the head, chest and torso. The black gun police recovered at the scene looked like their own     Smith & Wesson Military and Police semiautomatic pistol. It even had a laser sight. But police would soon learn that King’s weapon was a BB gun  —   a facsimile of the gun Mason used to shoot and kill the teen. At a news conference the next day, Columbus Police Chief Kim Jacobs waved a stock photograph of the BB gun. “Our officers carry a gun that looks practically identical to this weapon,” she said. “. . . It looks like a firearm that could kill you. ”           Police across the country say that they are increasingly facing off against people with    pellet guns, toy weapons and   replicas. Such encounters have led police to shoot and kill at least 86 people over the past two years, according to a Washington Post database of fatal police shootings nationwide. So far this year, police have fatally shot 43 people wielding the guns. In 2015, police also killed 43. The Post analysis is the first accounting of fatal police shootings involving people armed with air guns, toys or replicas, a phenomenon last studied in depth more than 25 years ago, when Congress first sought to address the problem of police shootings involving toy guns. The 86 shooting deaths are among the nearly 2, 000 people shot and killed by police since 2015, which The Post is tracking, something no government agency does. Police recovered a wide variety of the weapons in the fatal shootings, but almost all had one thing in common: They were highly realistic copies of firearms. Of those, 53 were pneumatic BB or pellet guns that fire   metal balls or pellets. An additional 16 were Airsoft guns, which use compressed air cartridges to fire plastic BBs. Thirteen were replicas, two were toys, one was a starter pistol and one was a lighter. Experts who study the domestic market for pellet and Airsoft guns said consumer demand for replica firearms has grown. “They are red hot,” said Tom Gaylord, an industry consultant who runs a popular blog for the   Pyramyd Air, one of the largest air gun retailers in the country. Pyramyd Air declined to comment. Police say it is virtually impossible to train officers to identify imitation firearms from any distance. Short of eliminating the guns, police have little choice but to assume the guns are lethal. Efforts to stop production of the guns or radically alter their appearance have mostly failed because of resistance from gunmakers and gun rights groups, such as the National Rifle Association. “We’re talking about this 26 years later, and I’m not sure anything has really changed except that tragic occurrences continue to happen,” said Chuck Wexler, who runs the Police Executive Research Forum, a policing policy think tank that studied the issue in 1990 for Congress. “A toy gun in a country with 300 million real guns is hard to distinguish. ”    Columbus Police Chief Kim Jacobs holds up a photo of the type of BB gun that police say    Tyre King pulled from his waistband just before he was fatally shot on Sept. 14, 2016. (Andrew    Press)  The role of imitation firearms in fatal police encounters reemerged as a national issue in 2014, when Cleveland police fatally shot    Tamir Rice, who was playing with a BB gun in a park. Police were responding to a call about a man with a gun outside a local recreation center. The shooting was among a spate of controversial and deadly encounters with police that helped galvanize the Black Lives Matter movement. Of the 86 fatal shootings involving imitation firearms since 2015, the most common theme was mental illness: 38 of those killed had a history of it, according to their families and police reports. Fourteen of the calls were domestic disturbances. Ten others began as robberies. The remaining circumstances range from patrolling neighborhoods to serving arrest warrants to making traffic stops. Of the people killed, 50 were white men. The oldest person killed was Robert Patrick Quinn, 77, who was fatally shot in Pittston, Pa. as he rode his motorized scooter outside an apartment complex while waving a   pellet gun. Half of the shootings happened at night. In almost every case, police said the victims failed to comply with an officer’s orders. In 60 cases, police said they pointed guns at officers. Among the dead are Ernesto Flores, a mentally distraught    man who after a standoff with police in April 2015 stepped out of a pink stucco home in Montclair, Calif. holding a BB gun.  Police opened fire, killing Flores in front of his family. One of only five women killed by police was    Shelly Haendiges, who was shot in Kokomo, Ind. after police responded to a robbery call and found her pointing a pellet gun at a store clerk. Her family said she suffered from mental illness. Two of the most recent shootings happened in October in Elkton, Md. where police shot and killed Brandon Jones and Chelsea M. Porter, both 25 and of Dover, Del. after they pointed BB guns at police who were trying to arrest them. The BB gun recovered after police killed King, the Ohio teenager, was made by Umarex USA, one of the largest air gun and firearm manufacturers in the world and the   “king of replicas. ” Umarex makes air guns under the Beretta, Colt, Smith & Wesson, HK, Ruger and Browning brands. It sells BB guns that are copies of such firearms as the iconic Colt Peacemaker, which was first produced in the 1870s, and the Heckler & Koch MP5 submachine, a mainstay of specialized military and police units. The Umarex 40XP BB gun that King allegedly brandished sells for about $50 in stores, including Walmart. Gunmaker Sig Sauer makes air guns that are advertised as “carbon copies” of their most popular lethal firearms, including the P226 semiautomatic handgun. A commercial on the Sig Sauer website displayed the BB gun and the lethal P226 as reflections of each other in a mirror. Umarex USA and Sig Sauer did not return repeated calls seeking comment. Gun rights groups, including Gun Owners of America, based in Virginia, have lobbied against laws that seek to alter air guns to make them distinguishable from firearms. Michael E. Hammond, a legal adviser to the   group, said the alterations never seem to be enough for those who dislike guns. “It all arises out of this general animus and   fear of anything that has to do with guns,” Hammond said. The NRA declined to comment. In Ohio, where King and Rice were killed, the state does not regulate BB guns and also allows firearms to be openly carried. The day after Rice’s death, black legislators in Ohio tried to regulate the guns, introducing a law requiring all BB and pellet guns sold in the state to have special markings or be brightly colored. The bill died in committee. Two years later, police shot King. “Why is it that a    would have nearly an exact replica of a police firearm on him in our neighborhoods, an   involved in very, very dangerous conduct in one of our neighborhoods?” Columbus Mayor Andrew Ginther (D) said at a news conference after the shooting.    Safety on In the 1980s, a string of police shootings of children prompted Congress to pass the first and only federal regulations on toy guns. In 1983,    Patrick Andrew Mason was alone in his Stanton, Calif. home when an officer who was called to the unit to do a welfare check mistook the boy with his red toy gun for a burglar; the boy was fatally shot while his single mother was away at work, according to news reports. In 1988, officers in San Francisco responding to a report of shots fired mistook a plastic toy gun for a .  pistol and shot a    mentally disabled boy in the head, killing him. Parents began to push manufacturers to make the guns appear less realistic. Retailers such as Toys “R” Us stopped carrying realistic toy guns, and toy manufacturers began adding an orange plug to toy guns. After several states restricted the use of imitation firearms, Congress in 1988 passed a law requiring the bright orange barrel plug on all toy guns. The law applied to water guns, many replicas and Airsoft guns that fire nonmetallic projectiles, but it exempted BB, pellet guns and replicas of antique firearms. The law also mandated two studies on whether the new orange tips would prevent shootings. In one study, FBI recruits were confronted by assailants carrying firearms or guns with orange tips. The recruits had two seconds to decide whether to shoot. When faced with unmarked replica pistols or guns with orange tips, officers shot 95 percent of the time. “It is clear from this study that the orange plug marking system does not help police officers distinguish between toy guns and real guns,” concluded the 1989 report, which was managed by the National Institute of Justice. The second study a year later reached the same conclusion, saying that police response when confronted with the guns was linked to environmental factors  —   such as what a police dispatcher tells an officer. Calls for service in a   area, for example, might lead officers to consider “a worst case scenario,” said the report, overseen by the Police Executive Research Forum. But it was the behavior of the person holding the toy gun that mattered most. “If they are told there’s a person with a gun acting in a threatening manner, that’s what they respond to,” said David L. Carter, a professor at Michigan State University who spoke to officers in 27 law enforcement agencies for the 1990 study. Last year, Congress revisited the issue when Sen. Barbara Boxer ( .) introduced a bill that would force the country to enact a law similar to California’s, which requires the entire surface of all toy and BB guns be painted a bright color. “No child should ever die because a police officer or anyone else mistakes a toy gun for a real weapon,” Boxer said in a news release at the time. The bill stalled in committee. Twelve states and the District and Puerto Rico have banned the guns or imposed restrictions on their use, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. In the District,   toy or   guns cannot be possessed in public. In 2012, D. C. police seized about 450 imitation guns, according to the most recent data available. Baltimore’s City Council this month passed a similar ban, responding to an April shooting and wounding by police of a    carrying a BB gun. In 2015, Boston outlawed imitation firearms in public. The law allows police to confiscate those guns, and they have seized 139 this year. Boston Police Commissioner William B. Evans said if a facsimile gun has been used in a crime, police will charge a suspect with possession of a real gun.  “They are the exact same unless you have it in your hand and take it apart,” Evans said.    Maurice Cardwell, Tyre King’s father, wears a pin in remembrance of his son during an event on what would have been King’s 14th birthday on Dec. 7. (Andrew   The Washington Post)  ‘Dangerous and unfair’ In March in Gainesville, Fla. Alachua County sheriff’s officers were called to a parking lot where they encountered    Robert L. Dentmond, who was armed with what appeared to be an   assault rifle. Dentmond was a high school sophomore who had lived in foster care, according to police reports. His mother went to prison and his father physically abused him, the records show. He was on probation for burglary. One bright spot for Dentmond was Cayla Todd, his girlfriend of one month. But on the night of March 20, Todd said they fought online and that she ended the relationship. Dentmond sent her a Facebook message, which investigators later found. “I’m finna have the police shoot me,” Dentmond wrote. At 10:07 p. m. Dentmond called police and said that he was at the Majestic Oaks Apartments with an  . When deputies and officers from the Gainesville Police Department arrived, they saw the   tall Dentmond, dressed in gray pajama pants and a blue jacket, in the middle of a dimly lit parking lot holding a gun. Crouching behind dumpsters and parked cars, police ordered him to drop the gun, according to police. “Drop it now, or you will be shot!” officers yelled. After 24 minutes, Dentmond leveled what looked to officers like an   rifle and began walking. Nine officers opened fire and didn’t stop until the gun fell from his hand. He died at a hospital. After the shooting, police saw Dentmond’s weapon had broken in two, according to a state report. When picking up the pieces, an officer noticed that their weight “did not feel right” and they seemed to be plastic. Officers did not learn until the next morning that Dentmond’s gun was a toy, an Airsoft rifle with the orange tip removed. “Some of them broke down in tears,” Alachua County Sheriff Sadie Darnell said. “It’s not a   situation. It’s a devastating   and lifelong impact. ” Grant McDougall, the psychotherapist who evaluated the deputies after the shooting, said they all wished that they could go back and change the outcome. “Every single one of them  —   some of them very graphically  —   grieved the loss, even if they would sit here and tell me they did the right thing,” McDougall told The Post. A grand jury investigating the shooting cleared the officers and suggested that the state ban imitation firearms. “It is dangerous and unfair to all for law enforcement to confront a situation where to all appearances a real weapon is involved, only to be subjected to intense   after the fact when that turns out not to have been so,” the jury said. Dentmond’s family could not be reached for comment. Todd told The Post that police could have done more. “He was only 16 years old. He didn’t need to die,” she said. Three months later, it almost happened again. In June, Alachua County deputies got a call that two groups of young men were driving around with  . The department sent every available unit, and they quickly came upon a black Honda Civic and a black Toyota Camry. Men wearing werewolf masks were hanging out the cars’ sunroofs waving what appeared to be Heckler & Koch MP5 machine guns, according to Darnell and records. Police disarmed the men. The guns were plastic toys, and the gunmen, university students were making a movie for a film contest. “This is what those of us in law enforcement are so concerned about,” Darnell said. “You never know what’s real or what’s not, so part of the solution is to ban the sale of toy or replica guns. ”    Demonstrators hold a rally for Tyre King outside city hall in Columbus, Ohio, on Sept. 19, 2016. (John   Press)  ‘Oh, he’s shooting them’ In Columbus, Ohio, Chief Kim Jacobs has spent the past few months explaining to outraged community members why one of her veteran police officers fatally shot a    carrying a BB gun. She wants people to understand how a mix of panicked reports of armed mayhem and a   gun can turn deadly. Complicating the matter is that the officer, Bryan Mason, had been involved in three shootings since 2009, one of them fatal. In 2012, Mason shot and killed a man who was pointing a firearm at another person. In all cases, Mason’s use of force was ruled justified by the department. Jacobs said Mason would not be allowed to comment until the conclusion of the investigation. Jacobs said the shooting has taken its toll on everyone, including Mason. “You go to work and you do your job, and then all of the sudden you’re under criminal investigation,” Jacobs said. King’s family has no sympathy for Mason. “Ain’t nobody held accountable,” said his father, Maurice Cardwell. “There’s no wrongdoing over there it seems. And you’re killing kids?” Sept. 14 started out like most days for Tyre King. His parents described him as an astute child who worked selling candy, cutting grass and trimming hedges. After King returned from school that day, he finished his homework and left his house. At 7:42 p. m. witnesses called 911 to report a robbery. The callers said a gunman wearing a hoodie and baggy pants fled the scene. The robbery victim came on the line and told dispatchers, “I’m not going to mess with it over $10. ” Another witness said seven or eight armed men were running away with police chasing them. “Oh, he’s shooting them. Oh my God,” a caller said, apparently describing police shooting King. Chanda L. Brown, an attorney for the family, said they had serious doubts that King was involved in the robbery and that he did not own a BB gun. Police have not disclosed the source of the gun. Brown said that she believes King was shot running away, not pulling a gun. The only person charged in the robbery is Demetrius E. Braxton, 19. His attorney, Lodema M’Poco,  told The Post last week that Braxton admits he used the gun to commit the robbery while King and others waited nearby. M’Poco said Braxton then passed the gun to King, who put the weapon in his pants. Braxton said that after police ordered him and King to the ground, King ran and Mason shot him. M’Poco said Braxton did not see King pull the BB gun from his pants.  Braxton pleaded guilty last month to felony robbery charges. In court he described the episode as a “lapse in judgment. As the oldest, I should have been the one to tell everybody, ‘Let’s not do this,’ ” the Columbus Dispatch reported.  Brown, the King family’s attorney, said police failed to train officers how to deal with children with BB guns. “Anyone that takes the blame and puts it on a    instead of an officer that’s been trained  —   or should be trained  —   in how to evaluate and respond to situations like this, I think they’re missing the bigger picture here,” Brown said. “Shooting should be the last resort. ” For Jacobs and other officers, they seldom have the benefit of weighing all the evidence and making a decision. “People don’t really understand the dynamics of a   situation, how fast they occur,” Jacobs said. “They all have families, they want to go home at the end of their shift. ”  Lee Powell, Teaganne Finn, Josephine Peterson and Taylor Hartz contributed to this report.

142327,217760,‘Tragedy’ inside Mosul as food runs out and the battle against ISIS drags on,Washington Post,Mustafa Salim,2016-12-18,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161219001336/https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/tragedy-inside-mosul-as-food-runs-out-and-the-battle-against-isis-drags-on/2016/12/18/689198d0-bbe9-11e6-ae79-bec72d34f8c9_story.html
","  MOSUL, Iraq  —   Hundreds of thousands of people who remain in this northern Iraqi city are struggling to find food and safe drinking water as the protracted offensive against Islamic State militants batters their neighborhoods.  When the battle began seven weeks ago, aid agencies feared that an exodus from the city would overwhelm already crowded camps. Instead, most people heeded government advice to stay in their homes as security forces advanced. Now many of those residents lack even basic services, with water supplies cut by the fighting, and U. N. and government aid distributions unable to reach all of those in need. Some residents are moving from neighborhood to neighborhood in search of food or to escape the bombardment. Meanwhile, in areas still controlled by the Islamic State, a siege by security forces is slowly tightening, pushing up food prices and causing shortages while the militants prevent people from leaving. Iraq is struggling to meet the needs of 3. 2 million people displaced over the past three years during fighting against the Islamic State. To limit the displacement from Mosul, the government airdropped leaflets over the city telling civilians to stay put.      (Video: Reuters   Photo: AP)   But few commanders expect the battle to finish anytime soon, and the misery unfolding in Mosul is expected to worsen as winter sets in. Reaching people inside the city is risky for humanitarian agencies, which also say they do not have enough aid to meet the need. This month, Iraqi counterterrorism forces escorted a truck carrying bottled water into the neighborhood of Zuhoor, which had been retaken two days earlier. People quickly crowded around to grab whatever they could. “Is there any food?” they clamored. “We don’t have any food. ”  Because of the shortages, some residents have decided to leave the recently reclaimed neighborhoods and move to others on the city’s edge that are better supplied. Only people who end up in the camps are included among the official number of displaced  —   100, 000 people  —   and the United Nations says it has no way to gauge how many internally displaced are in the city. Jassim   Iraq’s deputy minister for migration and displacement, estimated that more than 150, 000 are displaced within the city and that hundreds of thousands of others remain in their homes but still need aid. “There is some aid, but it’s a big battle,” he said. On the far eastern outskirts of the city, Haitham Mazin, 40, his wife and three children are living with a relative in Gogjali, where water and food are distributed more frequently, and some medical assistance is available. Mazin had wanted his family to stay in their home in the Zahra neighborhood after the area was retaken by Iraqi security forces, but the food and fuel he had stockpiled ran out. He said that aid distributions were haphazard and that while some people with connections to security forces had received enough assistance to even sell some, other families, including his, had gone without. Dependent on well water, which is not safe to drink, residents had fought when water supplies arrived, he said. “We became like beggars,” he said. “The government at the beginning told us to stay home, but they didn’t provide anything for us. ” Half the direct assistance provided by the United Nations since the beginning of the operation for Mosul has been distributed to those in the city, said Lise Grande, the organization’s humanitarian coordinator for Iraq. “We are very worried that we are going to run out of supplies,” she said. “We only have limited amounts of stocks, and if everyone near and inside Mosul requires help, we won’t have enough  —   not by a long shot. ”  The United Nations and its partners are providing food parcels to sustain families for a month  —   after which the government’s   system is supposed to take over. “We’re hoping this happens, because in many locations the first month is nearly over,” she said. Younes Sabri, 30, left the recaptured neighborhood of Bakr this month with his mother and two children. There was no food, water or electricity, he said, and the mortar shells were still falling. At first he had walked an hour each day to Gogjali in search of supplies to take back to his family, but then he had decided to move into the house of a friend in the neighborhood who had left for a camp when the area was engulfed in fighting. “The humanitarian situation there was very bad. Even the basics were not available,” he said of his neighborhood. But like others, he is wary of the camps, because once people are there, they are not allowed to leave, not even if their neighborhood has been retaken. “People of Mosul have only two options,” he said. “Either stay inside and die because of the bombing or hunger, or go to the camps  —   to the prison. Either way, it’s a slow death. ” Attiyah, the government minister, cited “security reasons” for restricting the movement of those in the camps. The government’s decision to try to keep people in their homes has slowed the battle, limiting the use of heavy artillery and airstrikes. Commanders are urging Iraqi Prime Minister Haider   to allow them to move families out of their neighborhoods temporarily to quicken the battle, but that could add to the humanitarian burden. For the moment, people are being given the choice of whether to stay or leave. Attiyah said he expects the situation to worsen. Security forces have retaken neighborhoods on the eastern side of the Tigris River, which carves the city in half, but have not yet entered areas on the other side. The situation in those Islamic   areas is also a “tragedy,” Attiyah said. “There is no water, no electricity, and a lot of the doctors have left. ” Instead of heading to the camps, some people have fled to western Mosul. When the fighting starts there, he said, they will have nowhere to run.  Read more:      "

"," She was groomed to be rich, famous and wed to a king. She became a perpetual   one of the most conspicuous names, faces and figures in the world. Reporters and photographers chronicled her every affair and scandal. She married well but not always wisely, nine times in all, with no monarch in the bunch, just a prince who bought the title.  In the otherwise staid cultural landscape of the 1950s and 1960s, Zsa Zsa Gabor stood out as a show business personality. Across continents she was recognized for the majestic sweep of blond hair, her green eyes and porcelain skin, her swanlike neck and her fetching Hungarian accent, plump with innuendo.  “Diamonds are a girl’s best friend and dogs are a man’s best friend,” she once remarked. “Now you know which sex has more sense. ”  Ms. Gabor, the voluptuous   international party girl and celebrity who cut a template for later and lesser   with names such as Kardashian and Hilton, died Dec. 18 at her home in Los Angeles. She was 99. Her publicist, Edward Lozzi, confirmed the death. The cause was not immediately known.    Zsa Zsa Gabor with director Alfred Hitchcock in 1957. (AP)  For much of her life Ms. Gabor kept her age preposterously vague. Reports of her birth year spanned from 1916 to 1930. If the latter was to be believed, she was 7 when she married for the first time. Her prominence depended almost entirely on her gusto for extravagant living, piquant quips about jewels and sex, and her   tips for the   paramour. Among her bon mots: ● “Getting divorced just because you don’t love a man is almost as silly as getting married just because you do. ”  ● “I’m a marvelous housekeeper. Every time I leave a man I keep his house. ” ● “I never hated a man enough to give him back his diamonds. ” ● “I want a man who’s kind and understanding. Is that too much to ask of a millionaire?” She seemed most in her element in nightclubs and on   talk shows, from the Jack Paar to the David Letterman eras. In a typical TV exchange, a woman seeking advice asked if she “did wrong” when she spent the night with a man.   Zsa Zsa Gabor in 1996. (Kim    Images)  “Dahhhling,” Ms. Gabor said in her accented English, “don’t you remember?” The   glamour magnet  —   often photographed wearing diamonds and white fur  —   displayed a talent for attracting men and headlines. She said her conquests included Frank Sinatra, Richard Burton, Sean Connery, Dominican playboy Porfirio Rubirosa and Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, widely known as the father of modern Turkey but to her “a professional lover, a god and a king. ”   In 1958, she accepted a $17, 000 chinchilla coat and a   from Rafael Trujillo Jr. the son of the Dominican strongman. She was rebuked on the floor of the U. S. House of Representatives during a debate over foreign aid for the Caribbean nation. From the well of the House floor, Rep. Wayne L. Hays  —   an Ohio Democrat whose career unraveled decades later over his own sex scandal  —   called her “the most expensive courtesan since Madame de Pompadour. ”  That same night, Ms. Gabor flew to Washington for a nightclub date and was mobbed by reporters seeking a comment.  “I’m a   girl,” she said blithely. Most reviewers regard Ms. Gabor’s best   work to be in director John Huston’s “Moulin Rouge” (1952) in which she portrayed Jane Avril, the nightclub’s renowned chanteuse who modeled for artist  . But Ms. Gabor said she detested working with Huston, who demanded that she suppress her considerable personality to allow the character’s to emerge.  “I was hired because I am Zsa Zsa Gabor, but when I go to work, directors try to force their methods on me,” she said. “John Huston’s intense, precise directions tortured me. ” Huston was said to have advised her: “Forget about acting. Just make love to the camera. ” For the rest of her career, her performances were notable mostly for her cool and stylish looks. Ms. Gabor was a wealthy widow in “Death of a Scoundrel” (1956) and she breezed through “Queen of Outer Space” (1958) as Talleah, ruler of an   civilization on Venus. She had a small part as a   owner in Orson Welles’s “Touch of Evil” (1958) and played twins, one of whom sleeps with Soviet leader Joseph Stalin, in “The Girl in the Kremlin” (1957). In her later years, she was hired to play campy versions of herself in films including “The Naked Gun 2  ” (1991) and “The Beverly Hillbillies” (1993).  Ms. Gabor wrote advice books, including “How to Catch a Man, How to Keep a Man, How to Get Rid of a Man” (1970). The husbands she caught, kept and got rid of included Turkish diplomat Burhan Belge, hotel magnate Conrad Hilton and   actor George Sanders, who later married Ms. Gabor’s sister Magda. Her other husbands included financier Herbert Hutner, oil executive Joshua Cosden Jr. inventor Jack Ryan (designer of Mattel’s Barbie doll) lawyer Michael O’Hara and Mexican businessman Felipe de Alba, whose marriage to Ms. Gabor lasted three days in 1982.  Ms. Gabor embodied a joie de vivre in the face of adversity. When Sanders reportedly hired detectives to find evidence she was having an affair with Rubirosa  —   onetime spouse of heiresses Barbara Hutton and Doris Duke  —   Ms. Gabor was said to have served the detectives champagne upon their arrival at the trysting spot. Sometimes her flair backfired.   In 1989, a Beverly Hills policeman stopped her for expired registration tags as she was driving in her   convertible. Words were exchanged. She slapped him.  In court, Ms. Gabor was convicted on misdemeanor charges of battery on a police officer, driving without a valid driver’s license and having an open bottle of alcohol in her car. A judge sentenced her to spend three days in jail, pay a $12, 000 fine and serve 120 hours of community service.   He also ordered Ms. Gabor, who was likely in her early 70s, to list her true age on her driver’s license. She claimed she was 59.   Sari Gabor, who received her nickname Zsa Zsa in childhood, was born in Budapest, most likely on Feb. 6, 1917. Her parents, Vilmos Gabor and the former Jolie Tilleman, were jewelry and porcelain merchants. Jolie, in particular, spoke of pushing her three beautiful daughters  —   the other two were Magda and Eva  —   to be “rich, famous and married to kings. ”   Zsa Zsa Gabor studied dance, languages and singing, and did stage work as a young woman. European society columns took note of her looks and love affairs. She was reported to have eloped for the first time at 14 and married Belge, the Turkish diplomat, in 1937.  She left Ankara, the Turkish capital, for Hollywood in 1941 with eight trunks of clothes. Her sister Eva, later to star on the CBS sitcom “Green Acres,” had taken up residence in the film colony.  Zsa Zsa Gabor immersed herself in a social circle that included the hotelier Hilton, whom she married in 1942 despite their   age gap. The marriage crumbled for many reasons, including her tendency to rack up exorbitant bills.    Her embrace of grand living culminated in her aptly titled 1991 memoir, “One Lifetime Is Not Enough,” a book that billed the author as “Assisted by, Edited by, and Put Into Proper English by Wendy Leigh. ”  In 1986, Ms. Gabor wed Prince Frédéric von Anhalt, a German police detective’s son who bought the title of a minor aristocrat. He is her only survivor. In 2005, Ms. Gabor and von Anhalt sued her only child, Francesca Hilton, for allegedly faking her mother’s signature to obtain a $2 million loan on the   Anhalt mansion in the Bel Air neighborhood of Los Angeles.  The case was dismissed in 2007 when Ms. Gabor did not show up in court, citing poor health. She had been partially paralyzed since a car wreck in 2002 and suffered leg infections that prevented her from going to court, her lawyers said.  Befitting her long career in the spotlight, every turn in her health, usually for the worse, was picked up by the tabloid media. She underwent hip surgery in 2010, then her right leg was amputated to avoid the spread of an infection.    There were accounts of her receiving last rites, then rallying to a more stable condition as her   husband collapsed from exhaustion.   Francesca Hilton died in January 2015 at 67.  When asked her assessment of other socialites fond of the media glare, Ms. Gabor usually said she found them lacking. “I think she’s rather silly,” she told Vanity Fair magazine of Paris Hilton, the   of her second husband. “She does too many things for publicity. ” "
142329,217768,China said it would return a seized U.S. naval drone. Trump told them to ‘keep it.’,Washington Post,Missy Ryan,2016-12-18,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161219001336/https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/china-said-it-would-return-a-seized-us-naval-drone-trump-told-them-tokeep-it/2016/12/18/9e3f6f82-c4d3-11e6-9a51-cd56ea1c2bb7_story.html
"," The Chinese government said Saturday it will return a U. S. naval drone seized last week in the South China Sea, a step toward defusing maritime tensions between the two Pacific powers.    Donald Trump reacted to the news by telling them he doesn’t want it back. “We should tell China that we don’t want the drone they stole back.  let them keep it!” he tweeted Saturday evening. The comment could prolong one of the most serious incidents between the U. S. and Chinese militaries in recent memory, potentially complicating ties ahead of Trump’s inauguration. The latest spike in U. S.  maritime tensions occurred Thursday, when a Chinese submarine rescue ship close to the USNS Bowditch, an oceanographic survey vessel operating about 50 nautical miles northwest of Subic Bay in the Philippines, took possession of the U. S. drone. The incident occurred within sight of the Bowditch, which tracks the drone as it collects unclassified data on water temperature, salinity and other factors that may affect U. S. naval operations. According to U. S. officials, the Chinese ship refused initial requests from the Bowditch to return the drone.      (Jason Aldag, Julie   Washington Post   Satellite photos courtesy of CSIS)   “We have registered our objection to China’s unlawful seizure of a U. S. unmanned underwater vehicle operating in international waters in the South China Sea,” Pentagon press secretary Peter Cook said in a statement. “Through direct engagement with Chinese authorities, we have secured an understanding that the Chinese will return the [drone] to the United States,” he said.  China’s Ministry of Defense on Saturday said they had decided to return the drone in an “appropriate” manner, but did not specify what that meant.  Yang Yujun, a spokesman for the Ministry of Defense, said in a statement that the Chinese took the U. S. drone “in order to prevent the device from harming the navigation safety and personnel safety of the ship. ” “The U. S. military has frequently dispatched naval vessels to carry out reconnaissance and military measurements in China’s water. China resolutely opposes this and urges the U. S. side to stop such activities,” he said. The statement, which was published before Trump’s “keep it” tweet, called the U. S. response to the drone’s seizure “hype” that is “inappropriate” and “unhelpful for settling the problem. ” Beijing has yet to respond to the  ’s latest comment.    Song Zhongping, an expert on Chinese military affairs who works as a commenter for Hong Kong’s Phoenix TV, said the statement was an effort to warn the United States to not deploy this type of vessel in the South China Sea, “Otherwise, we will keep on picking them up whenever we see them,” he said.  Despite sharp words on both sides, official statements from Washington and Beijing suggest that the two governments are eager to avoid further intensifying tensions at a moment of deep uncertainty in U. S.  relations after Trump’s election. Even as China asserts a right to areas of the South and East China seas also claimed by some of its neighbors, it has embarked on an ambitious program of constructing artificial islands, some of which appear to be intended as military outposts. The U. S. military has conducted repeated shows of force, sailing ships or conducting surveillance flights near disputed areas, while seeking to avoid any serious military escalation with a key commercial partner. Speaking after the Pentagon announced that the drone would be returned, a U. S. defense official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to comment freely, said that the Obama administration was “glad to get it back and put this behind us. ” “It’s somewhat reassuring that senior leadership in Beijing agreed that this was something that should be returned, regardless of the individual actions of their people at sea,” the official said. It is not clear who authorized the seizure of the drone.  The flap over the drone comes as Trump’s election generates concern among Chinese authorities, with the   questioning   U. S. policy on China and continuing his sharp criticism of Beijing’s trade and monetary policies. Trump angered Chinese officials when he spoke by phone with the president of Taiwan, a thriving democracy that Beijing considers a breakaway province. While it is not clear how the Trump administration will handle efforts by China to assert itself in the South China Sea, his stance toward Beijing suggests a hard line. On Saturday morning, Trump issued a tweet that said: “China steals United States Navy research drone in international waters  —   rips it out of water and takes it to China in unprecedented act. ” In Beijing on Sunday, the Global Times, a Communist   newspaper known for its nationalist tone, poked fun at the mixed messages coming from the United States. “Before Trump’s generous announcement that he didn’t want the drone back, the Pentagon had already announced publicly that they have asked China to return the ‘illegally seized’ [unmanned underwater vehicle] through appropriate governmental channels,” the paper wrote. “We don’t know, after seeing Trump’s new tweets, if the Pentagon should feel boggled. ”  Rauhala reported from Taipei and Luna Lin reported from Beijing.

142330,217769,A dad was awakened by his toddler’s crying. He found a stranger holding her in the living room.,Washington Post,Amy B Wang,2016-12-18,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161219001336/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/true-crime/wp/2016/12/18/a-dad-was-awakened-by-his-toddlers-crying-he-found-a-stranger-holding-her-in-the-living-room/
","     Around 2:30 a. m. last Thursday, a father in Tempe, Ariz. awoke to the sounds of his    daughter crying, so he left his bedroom to check on her. In his living room was a disheveled stranger  —   and on the stranger’s lap was the father’s young child. “I’m your friend,” the man told the father as he tossed the crying toddler onto the couch. What ensued after the startling encounter, as outlined in police reports, was a   struggle between the father and the intruder, identified as    Oren Aharon Cohen.      Oren Aharon Cohen has been charged with burglary and kidnapping after entering a family’s Tempe, Ariz. apartment in the middle of the night and holding their baby. This video shows his court appearance. (Maricopa County Superior Court)   As the child’s mother called 911, the father attempted to stop Cohen from fleeing the apartment, police said. Cohen was able to escape the apartment and made it down a flight of stairs to the complex parking lot before the father caught him. When Tempe police officers arrived, they used a stun gun to detain Cohen because he reportedly resisted officers’ commands. Police arrested Cohen on charges of   burglary, aggravated assault and kidnapping. Court documents identified him as an Israeli citizen who is in the United States legally with a valid passport.  Police did not name the child or her parents in their arrest report. After investigating the apartment, police said they discovered Cohen’s shoes in the   ’s bedroom. His coat was wedged between her mattress and the wall, and his passport was on the floor near the foot of the toddler’s bed, police said. Police also found that Cohen had used a bathroom in the apartment and drank some orange juice from the family’s refrigerator. The child’s father said that after the confrontation, they found that the    was still wearing the same pajamas and diaper she had been wearing when they put her to bed, according to the police report. Cohen told police he had been drinking with a friend who lived in the same apartment complex and remembered very little because he was extremely intoxicated, according to the police report. “Oren advised with 100 percent certainty that he did not perform or engage in any sexual acts with the victim of this incident,” the report said. “Once it was relayed to Oren that the victim in his incident was a    female, he became very upset and broke down crying. Oren said he would never hurt a child and does not remember the details of this incident because he was ‘black out drunk.’ ” What Cohen could remember was seeing and playing with a “midget” in a dark room; his descriptions of this “midget” matched those of the    girl, police said.  Cohen is being held at a Maricopa County jail on a $250, 000 cash bond. He has told police that he wanted to return to Israel as a result of the incident, according to court documents. Recorded video of Cohen’s initial court appearance Friday showed him nodding as a judge explained the charges against him  —   then pleading to explain what had happened, despite a warning that anything he said could be used against him later. “Yes, but I didn’t do anything so that’s why I want to say something,” Cohen said. “I went to visit a friend. Her name is Carolina. She lives in this complex. We were drinking a lot over there in her house. We went outside  —   I went outside [to] smoke a cigarette. I guess I got blacked out. I went to the wrong door and that’s why you guys charge me [with] burglary? For going to the wrong apartment. ” Cohen continued, saying he didn’t realize what was happening or where he was because it was dark. “And I guess, that’s when I saw this midget,” Cohen said. “It looks like a midget and I thought it’s [a] midget. ” Alluding to questions of whether he may have touched the girl inappropriately, Cohen insisted: “I would never do anything like that. My dad is a sex offender. I would never do anything even close to that. ” He asked the judge to allow his friends and family who were “here and not here” to vouch for him. Cohen will have a   lawyer, according to the judge. His next court appearance is scheduled for Thursday, and a preliminary hearing is scheduled for Dec. 27.

142331,217770,How ‘Saturday Night Live’ managed to turn 2016’s chaos into TV gold,Washington Post,Elahe Izadi,2016-12-18,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161219001336/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2016/12/18/how-saturday-night-live-capitalized-on-an-unprecedented-political-moment/
","     It’s an unusual time for   humor. Rarely has the news cycle been so ripe for comedic commentary and the landscape so saturated with options for viewers. “Saturday Night Live” has done well in that arena, airing a midseason finale on Saturday that concluded months of high ratings and critical praise. SNL’s ability to skewer Donald Trump, book hotly anticipated hosts and attract weeks of   from the   himself have all boosted the show’s relevance. The sketch show successfully took advantage of a bizarre political climate that has brought its own   television ratings and, at times, has felt more like a reality show than the conclusion of a campaign season. Preliminary ratings show that SNL is on track to surpass last year’s numbers. That makes sense given that political humor has long served as the show’s staple material, and its most defining moments  —   Tina Fey as Sarah Palin, Will Ferrell as George W. Bush  —   have often come during election years. But this season also contrasts with last year, when “Saturday Night Live” ended up in a maelstrom of controversy for having   Trump on as host. That 2015 episode brought in record ratings and plenty of blowback, including concerns over whether SNL would break FCC rules on giving political candidates equal time on air. Protesters said the show’s producers and writers helped “normalize” Trump’s behavior during the primaries.    Donald Trump during his SNL monologue on Nov. 7, 2015. (Dana   via AP)  “I feel like the media has already normalized his behavior,” SNL   writer Bryan Tucker said in an interview with Vulture a year after the episode aired. “Our job is not to promote one candidate or the other. Our job is to take what’s already happening and make fun of it. ” In the end, many tuned in to see just what would happen. Trump appeared on camera for a total of 12 minutes in an episode that earned terrible reviews. This season started off differently, with Alec Baldwin debuting his biting Trump impersonation. About 8. 3 million viewers tuned in, and the Oct. 1 episode became SNL’s   premiere since 2008. The   presidential debate mocked during the premiere earned unprecedented ratings in its own right, drawing more than 84 million viewers. SNL apparently understood a parody’s potential for high ratings: The show rarely announces upcoming cameos, but it did just that when it released a trailer promoting Baldwin’s Trump impersonation to complement Kate McKinnon’s take on Hillary Clinton. (McKinnon won an outstanding supporting actress Emmy this year for her work on the show.) SNL also secured big names as hosts this season, most notably Dave Chappelle. The   comic marked his return to television with SNL’s first   episode, which featured a more than    monologue, a cameo by Chris Rock and musical guest A Tribe Called Quest.      Comedian Dave Chappelle made his hosting debut on ”Saturday Night Live.” Here are some of the highlights. (Thomas   Washington Post)   The Chappelle episode brought the highest ratings among the crucial   to    demographic since Jimmy Fallon hosted the 2013 Christmas episode.  Very early ratings from this Saturday’s episode, which featured Casey Affleck as host and Chance the Rapper as musical guest, have it on track to be the strongest showing since Chappelle hosted, and higher than the average episode rating SNL had in December 2015. A full ratings report will be published by Nielsen on Tuesday. Aside from Trump parodies, these past few months of the   show have featured a series of notable sketches  —   some insightful political commentary, some downright silly  —   that inspired plenty of hot takes. Those include “Black Jeopardy,” Tom Hanks as David S. Pumpkins and a commercial for “Wells for Boys. ” SNL has also managed to stay in the news cycle days after an episode airs  —   thanks, in large part, to how   Trump has responded to the show. He’s repeatedly tweeted his grievances, calling the show “unwatchable,” “biased” and not “funny at all. ”  Baldwin has tweeted back in kind, saying he will stop if Trump releases his tax returns. “Did you see that my friend Mr. Baldwin is in a Twitter feud with our  ?” SNL alum Tina Fey  —   who suggested to showrunner Lorne Michaels that Baldwin play Trump  —   said in an interview with David Letterman for the Hollywood Reporter. Aside from making her sad that a Twitter feud is “so beneath a president,” she said of Trump, “You think you’re good at being a jerk on Twitter? You will now face the grandmaster of being a jerk on Twitter. ” Earlier this month, Matt Lauer asked Trump three times why he wouldn’t just stop watching the show. Trump skirted the question, repeated his gripes and finally said, “Frankly, the way the show is going now, and you look at the kind of work they’re doing, who knows how long that show is going to be on? It’s a terrible show. ” SNL returns Jan. 14 with Felicity Jones as host.

142332,217771,Aleppo evacuation efforts falter as Islamist fighters burn convoy of rescue buses,Washington Post,Louisa Loveluck,2016-12-18,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161219001336/https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/cowardly-attack-in-syria-targets-buses-sent-to-evacuate-government-held-villages/2016/12/18/ba7671bc-c525-11e6-bf4b-2c064d32a4bf_story.html
","  BEIRUT  —   Evacuation efforts in Syria were on the verge of fresh collapse Sunday, with thousands of people trapped inside the shattered rebel enclave of Aleppo after gunmen burned a rescue convoy bound for government areas in a neighboring province.  The   Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said evacuations were postponed for an “unknown” period, deepening abject suffering inside eastern Aleppo as the United Nations thrashed out ways to resolve the crisis. After more than three hours of closed consultations, France and Russia said Sunday that they had agreed on a U. N. Security Council resolution to deploy international monitors to eastern Aleppo to ensure safe evacuations and immediate delivery of humanitarian aid. Negotiations to revive a complicated exit deal for civilians and fighters in Aleppo have broken down repeatedly since forces loyal to Syrian President Bashar   forced the rebels’ effective surrender there last week, amid abuses by government and rebel loyalists along the evacuation routes. And Sunday, hours after the International Committee of the Red Cross said it was hopeful that evacuations could resume, a fresh hurdle emerged: Video footage from the northwestern province of Idlib showed smoke and fire billowing from a convoy of repurposed school buses bound for Fouaa and Kefraya, Shiite villages besieged by rebels that have taken on great symbolic importance for Syrian President Bashar   and his Iranian backers. Islamist fighters had set fire to the buses, which were sent to evacuate hundreds of wounded people from those   villages. Iran, a Shiite power, had demanded that the area be evacuated as part of the broader deal allowing thousands of people to leave what remains of the   eastern areas of Aleppo.  “You pigs are here to help Shiites. You won’t leave alive,” a man is heard saying off camera in one of the video clips. Although the identity of the attackers is not clear, reports suggest that they had the backing of Jabhat Fatah   an    Sunni group with significant influence in Idlib.  “Cowardly terrorist attack on civilian buses & killing driver must not end evacuations,” Jan Egeland, a humanitarian adviser to the United Nations, said Sunday in a tweet. In another video, the militants appeared on camera, chanting that the attack had restored the “dignity of Aleppo’s besieged people. ” But inside the rebel enclave in Aleppo, desperate residents said it only brought more misery, with thousands awaiting evacuation in freezing temperatures as night fell. The enclave has been reduced to a pinprick of territory after government forces swept in earlier this month, backed by heavy bombing raids.   The compromise struck Sunday between Russia, an Assad ally that is helping him with troops and weapons, and France offers hope to the beleaguered residents of eastern Aleppo, many of whom are wary of leaving the area unless international observers monitor the evacuations. On Friday, a bus carrying hundreds of evacuees was held up by   militia fighters who were later accused of ordering dozens of people off the bus and then stripping, robbing and reportedly killing several in the group.  “Tell me, what do we do, what choices do we have?” said Ahmed   an engineer in eastern Aleppo. “If we leave, we risk death or humiliation in front of the people we love. But if we stay here? That is death, too. ” The United Nations also accused Syrian government troops and a Shiite militia from Iraq last week of carrying out    executions as they swept through the area. Samantha Power, the U. S. ambassador to the United Nations, told reporters Sunday that there had been “many, many reports of people being pulled off buses and disappeared, whether into conscription or into torture chambers or killed outright. ” After earlier disagreements, France and Russia said Sunday that they had agreed to the text of a draft Security Council resolution that would allow about 100 U. N. observers to deploy quickly to the area. A vote was expected Monday. François Delattre, France’s ambassador to the United Nations, said the resolution, if formally approved, could prevent “mass atrocities. ”  The announcement followed a statement last week from   Ayrault, France’s foreign minister, who decried the situation in Syria as “an affront to the human conscience. ”  “There is, now more than ever, an urgent need to put an end to the hostilities in Aleppo,” Ayrault said. “The regime’s supporters, starting with Russia, cannot let this happen and accept a strategy based on revenge and systematic terror without running the risk of becoming accomplices to the crimes. ” When rebels seized eastern Aleppo from the government in 2012, they had hoped to create a seat of power to rival the Syrian capital, Damascus. Four years on, Aleppo’s recapture by government forces has accelerated the demise of the armed opposition, which will now be boxed inside Idlib without any strategic urban centers under its control.  James McCauley in Paris contributed to this report.       "

","     It seems that the second time’s the charm for Major League Baseball’s favorite   lovers, Nats slugger Bryce Harper and fiancee Kayla Varner, who finally tied the knot this weekend. According to the Nats fan site TalkNats. com, Harper and Varner got married this weekend (it’s still unclear whether the wedding took place Friday or Saturday) at the Mormon temple in San Diego.   cannot attend an official temple wedding, so the ceremony was probably much smaller than the postnuptial celebration, which reportedly included Harper’s teammates Jayson Werth and Trea Turner. Nats GM Mike Rizzo also was in attendance. Since mysteriously nixing their original plans to get hitched in 2015, high school sweethearts Varner and Harper had been flying under the radar.

","  BERLIN  —   A massive black truck plowed into a Christmas market teeming with revelers in west Berlin on Monday, killing at least 12 people, wounding dozens more and leaving Germans mourning a national tragedy during the holiday season. The incident, described by the White House as an apparent “terrorist attack,” had echoes of the deadly truck assault in the French city of Nice in July, which killed 86 people and was claimed by the Islamic State. German Interior Minister Thomas de Maizière told Germany’s ARD national broadcaster: “I don’t want to use the word attack yet, although a lot points to one. ” German authorities late Monday were questioning a male suspect arrested several hundred yards from the site, who matched a description of the truck driver. A dead body was found in the passenger side of the truck, which had Polish license plates. Two senior German officials briefed on the matter told The Washington Post that the suspect is believed to be a Pakistani national who arrived in February as an asylum seeker. If the man is confirmed as the culprit, it is likely to fuel an   debate in Germany over Chancellor Angela Merkel’s decision to open the door last year to nearly 1 million migrants, most of them fleeing war in the Middle East. The deadly incident occurred near the historic Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church in the Breitscheidplatz, a major public plaza. The bloodshed came at the height of activity at the Christmas markets, a cherished German tradition that draws locals and tourists to city squares for mugs of mulled wine, grilled sausages and regional sweets, as well as shopping at quaint stalls that sell handmade ornaments and other items.

"," Donald Trump clinched the presidency Monday as members of the electoral college cast ballots declaring him the victor, a perfunctory conclusion to the most stunning presidential contest in modern history.  Trump became the winner Monday afternoon after electors from Texas cast ballots and put him over the 270 electoral votes needed to win. Results will be officially announced Jan. 6 in a special joint session of Congress. While Democrat Hillary Clinton amassed a nearly 3   lead in the popular vote, Trump won the    electoral map, making him  . That political dichotomy sparked special scrutiny and intense lobbying of electors by Trump’s opponents in recent weeks, including mass protests. It also drew outsize attention to the usually overlooked, constitutionally obligated gatherings of 538 electors in 50 states and the District of Columbia.   The mostly symbolic calls for an electoral college rejection of Trump grew after revelations of a CIA assessment that Russian hacking could have boosted his campaign, which in the view of many Trump critics raised doubts about his legitimacy.      (Jenny   Washington Post)   Trump has dismissed the intelligence community’s analysis of Russia’s role in the election and has boasted, including on Monday, of a “historic” electoral landslide. But his    win over Clinton ranks just 46th out of 58 electoral college margins. “This election represents a movement that millions of hard working men and women all across the country stood behind and made possible,” Trump said in a statement. “With this historic step we can look forward to the bright future ahead. ” His detractors called on electors to buck the   in favor of Clinton  —   or Trump’s running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, or another Republican such as Ohio Gov. John Kasich. Ultimately, Kasich earned one vote from an elector in Texas. So did former congressman Ron Paul ( . ). In Washington state, three electors cast votes for former secretary of state Colin Powell, while another voted for Faith Spotted Eagle, a member of the Sioux tribe from South Dakota who opposes the Dakota Access Pipeline.  Pence earned the requisite electoral votes to serve as vice president, but in Washington state, Sens. Susan Collins ( ) and Elizabeth Warren ( .) also earned some votes.  Across the country, critics of the   braved cold temperatures and rallied outside state capitol buildings in hopes that electors might act as an emergency brake on Trump.  In Pennsylvania, which voted for a Republican president for the first time since 1988, a few hundred   Democrats protested in Harrisburg while all 20 electors backed Trump. In Utah, protesters booed and shouted “Shame on you” as the state’s six electors cast votes for Trump in a capitol building conference room in Salt Lake City.      (McKenna Ewen, Whitney Shefte, Dalton   Washington Post)    In Florida, a crucial swing state where Trump defeated Clinton by about a percentage point, Trump won all 29 electoral votes. He also earned all 16 votes in Michigan, another state that flipped to Republicans for the first time since 1988.  On the streets of Washington, D. C. two dozen protesters assembled outside Trump’s hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue, singing songs such as “We Shall Overcome. ” Some held signs, including one that read, “Resist Putin’s Puppet. ” The District’s three electors later gathered at city hall, just a block from Trump’s hotel. In Albany, N. Y. former president Bill Clinton sat in the state Senate chamber as an elector and cast one of the Empire State’s 29 electoral votes for his wife.  “I’ve never cast a vote I was prouder of,” he told reporters after the meeting.   Despite the pleas of Trump opponents, most electors had said for weeks that they planned to cast votes reflecting the will of their home states.  “Any choice was better than Hillary, so it’s not a hard choice for me,” Oklahoma Republican elector Charles Potts said in a recent interview. Richard Snelgrove, an elector who also serves as a Salt Lake County, Utah, council member, said he had received “thousands of emails, hundreds of letters and a few phone calls  —   most of them respectful, a couple over the top, and a few that have been downright threatening. ”  Most of the messages asked him to vote for Clinton on the grounds that she won the national popular vote. But Snelgrove said there was no justification for such a move.  “No one elected me king, and it’s my job to reflect the will of the people of Utah,” he said. “They chose Trump. ” In Harrisburg,   Kavey, 68, had driven from neighboring New York state to try to persuade Pennsylvania’s electors to switch allegiance.  “I think the Constitution charges the electors with preventing exactly what is happening here  —   a hostile takeover of our government by a bigot who has been supported by Russia,” Kavey said. “I know nothing will come of this, but my conscience won’t let me do any less. ” In Austin, Joni Ashbrook, 64, and her best friend, Mary Robinson, 62, stood outside the   Texas capitol, holding two ends of a banner that Ashbrook had sewed. “Resist Trump’s Agenda,” the sign read.  Ashbrook, a retired   science teacher, said that she knew the electors would probably vote for Trump but that she was troubled by Trump’s Cabinet picks and disregard for global warming.  “I’d like for them to be very thoughtful about what’s going on around them,” Ashbrook said of the electors. “But this is just another way for us to say ‘no.’ ”  In Maryland, all 10 of the state’s electors voted for Clinton during a meeting in the Governor’s Reception Room at the State House in Annapolis. Maryland law requires electors to vote for the winner of the state’s popular vote, which Clinton won easily. Maggie McIntosh, a state delegate from Baltimore, choked up as she announced the results to an audience of more than 70 spectators. “This is kind of an emotional moment,” McIntosh said with tears in her eyes. “It’s an emotional moment for many women in this country and this state. Hillary Rodham Clinton was the first woman nominated by a major political party for president of the United States. She won the majority of votes here in Maryland, the electors today have chosen her as president, and she won the majority of votes in this country. ”   The CIA’s assessment of Russia’s election interference prompted 10 electors  —   nine Democrats and one Republican  —   to request an intelligence briefing to learn more about Moscow’s role, a move endorsed by some of Clinton’s top campaign aides. Other groups had urged electors to postpone the vote until Trump explains what he plans to do about his multinational family business empire.  Trump has declined to explain his plans in person but has tweeted that he will hand over    responsibilities for his company to his adult sons, who will do “no new deals” while he occupies the White House.  Intelligence officials last week declined requests to brief electors, saying they will provide congressional briefings only when a review ordered by President Obama is completed. Electors each cast two votes, one for president and one for vice president. In every state, officials prepared a “certificate of vote” to be sent to Washington for processing by Congress and the National Archives. Lawmakers are scheduled to gather Jan. 6 in the House chamber to hear the results from the states in alphabetical order during a session set to be led by Vice President Biden. It will allow lawmakers to challenge the results or the votes of individual electors. The Constitution says nothing about how electors should vote, but some states bind them to the results of the popular vote, and some state parties essentially force electors to take a loyalty pledge to serve. Just a handful of electors tested the limits this year, but it wasn’t immediately clear whether those who voted for people other than Clinton or Trump would face punishment. While much of the uncertainty headed into the day centered on how many electors would vote against Trump in the states he won, it was Clinton who saw her tally shrink further. In the state of Washington, a liberal stronghold where the Democratic nominee won the popular vote comfortably, Clinton won eight of the 12 electors. Three of the remaining four cast votes for Powell, who served in the administration of George W. Bush. And there was the vote for Faith Spotted Eagle.  State Democrats had selected their electors at a lightly attended party convention packed mostly with supporters of Sen. Bernie Sanders ( .) the   in the Democratic presidential primary race. Electors in Colorado and Minnesota also tried and failed to buck Clinton. In Maine, elector David Bright initially cast his ballot for Sanders to honor thousands of younger voters who had supported the senator. But state officials ruled that Bright’s vote was improper. They ordered a revote, and Bright voted the second time for Clinton.

142337,217782,Trump meets with Carlos Slim as Mexican leaders seek better relations,Washington Post,Philip Rucker,2016-12-19,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161220002023/https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-dines-with-carlos-slim-as-relations-warm-with-mexican-leaders/2016/12/19/652ccf7c-c60f-11e6-bf4b-2c064d32a4bf_story.html
"," In the closing days of his campaign, Donald Trump vilified one of the world’s richest men  —   Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim  —   as part of a globalist cabal conspiring to extinguish his populist candidacy. Yet over the weekend, Slim journeyed to    Trump’s estate in Palm Beach, Fla. for what the   described as “a lovely dinner with a wonderful man. ” The peacemaking gesture  —   the culmination of weeks of   negotiations that included a secret visit to Mexico City by a Trump envoy  —   signals a possible thawing between Trump and Mexico’s business and political elite, which he had used relentlessly as a foil throughout his campaign. The communications raised hopes in Mexico’s business community that Trump might reconsider his vow to tear up the North American Free Trade Agreement and be persuaded to adopt less   immigration and economic policies, which were cornerstones of his campaign. Larry Rubin, president of the American Society of Mexico and a key liaison between Republican officials in the United States and Mexican leaders, said Trump and his team are forging a better understanding of shared economic interests between the two countries.      (The Washington Post)   “What   Trump wants to do in coming closer to the Mexican business community has an impact not only nationally but regionally with Latin America and opens the doors for good business relations overall,” said Rubin, who is one of several candidates to serve as Trump’s ambassador to Mexico. “The closer that the administration is to businesses and governments in Mexico and in the region, the better for the U. S. ” But Trump has made no declaration of any shift in his immigration or trade policies, and any softening would carry the risk of angering his core supporters.  Saturday, just hours before his dinner with Slim, Trump staged the final rally of his “thank you” tour in Mobile, Ala. and the crowd chanted, “Build that wall!” “Do not worry. We are going to build the wall,” Trump said, reiterating his promise to erect a wall along the U. S.  border to keep out undocumented immigrants and to make Mexico pay for it.  Trump and Slim’s dinner was designed to open a friendly line of communication rather than delve into policy details, according to people briefed on the discussions. Slim’s visit to    came after Corey Lewandowski, a former Trump campaign manager who remains a confidant of the   quietly visited Mexico City on Dec. 9 to meet with Slim. After the election, Slim connected with Lewandowski  —   someone he saw as having Trump’s ear but not as a formal member of his staff  —   and arranged for them to discuss trade, economic and other issues, according to people with knowledge of the session.      (McKenna Ewen, Whitney Shefte, Dalton   Washington Post)   Slim has long been the dominant figure in Mexico’s business community. He has a net worth estimated at $77 billion, according to the most recent tally by Forbes magazine. He controls Latin America’s largest telecom company, América Móvil, and is also involved in banking, construction, retail, health care, oil and other businesses. Slim also is the largest single investor in the New York Times Co. Trump’s meeting with Slim is the latest example of the   reconciling with former foes  —   most prominently, Mitt Romney, the 2012 GOP presidential nominee who had led the Republican resistance to Trump’s candidacy but became a serious candidate for secretary of state. During the campaign, Slim strongly criticized Trump’s rhetoric about Mexican Americans as well as his plans to renegotiate NAFTA and build the border wall. Slim said that Trump’s proposed tariff on imports would “destroy” the U. S. economy.  Trump in turn accused Slim of helping promote his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, and cast him as part of a global conspiracy. At an Oct. 14 rally, Trump attacked Slim personally and accused Times journalists of being “corporate lobbyists for Carlos Slim. ” Trump’s quarrel with Slim extends to the very beginning of his campaign. At his June 2015 announcement speech, Trump’s remarks about undocumented Mexican immigrants being criminals and rapists sparked an intense furor. A television company controlled by Slim canceled a project it had been working on with Trump’s company, and Slim’s spokesman said Trump was “ ” and his comments “totally out of line. ” Trump told friends at the time that he believed Slim  —   who once had a business relationship with a rival candidate, former Florida governor Jeb Bush  —   helped orchestrate the public backlash. “He believes Carlos Slim was behind a lot of his problems,” said one Trump friend, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to be candid. This person suggested that Trump sees a benefit to Saturday’s dinner: “He wants to neutralize him. ” After Trump’s unexpected victory, Slim’s tone toward the    changed. In recent comments, Slim has spoken optimistically about Trump’s presidency. “If Trump is able to grow the United States economy and jobs, that would be fantastic for Mexico,” Slim told a business forum. Slim’s evolution comes as the Mexican government is undertaking an extensive effort to preserve NAFTA by proving Mexico’s worth to the U. S. economy. Since Trump’s win, Mexican diplomats have sought to spread the message to immigrants, through the network of 50 consulates in the United States, about their rights and legal protections.  The Mexican government has enlisted business executives in both countries to talk about the economic benefits of free trade in what one Mexican official described as “the language that the new president speaks: deals and entrepreneurial vision. ” Mexican officials have readied themselves to discuss NAFTA, or any other topic, with the incoming administration. But they have also stressed that they don’t yet know what policies Trump intends to pursue.  “The truth is right now we don’t even have a [negotiating] table,” Paulo Carreño, Mexico’s deputy foreign secretary for North American affairs, said in a recent interview.  While Trump’s election has presented challenges for Mexico, Carreño said, the government remains “cautiously optimistic” about the prospects for the bi lateral relationship.  Carlos Sada, Mexico’s ambassador to the United States, said in a speech last week to the Council of the Americas that his country would “work to find common ground with the next U. S. administration. ”  Sada added, “Besides my basic efforts to get to know better the character of the U. S.   we have to seriously recognize the juncture at which we are standing today: We either capitalize it and turn it into opportunity for the sake of a new stage of our integration and shared growth or risk a major setback. ” A group of CEOs from both countries met in Mexico City recently for a public policy summit chaired by Tom Donohue, president of the U. S. Chamber of Commerce; John Rice, vice chairman of General Electric; Juan Pablo Castañón, chairman of the Consejo Coordinador Empresarial, a Mexican   business council; and Armando Garza, chairman of Alfa, a   multinational conglomerate. Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto and a number of his ministers attended the session, where business leaders discussed the impact of Trump’s election on   trade and other economic matters, according to people familiar with the meeting. Earl Anthony Wayne, a former U. S. ambassador to Mexico under President Obama, said there is “a lot of concern and a desire to find a positive way forward. ” “It’s a million dollars a minute in trade that goes across our border,” Wayne said. “The CEOs are very interested in preserving what they see as mutually beneficial relations. There’s a lot of attention to what the policies will turn out to be and a desire to have a dialogue with whoever the new officials will be. ” In August, Trump made a splashy visit to Mexico City to meet with Peña Nieto, where the   was unusually subdued and struck a cooperative tone with the Mexican leader. Trump said at a joint news conference that day that he and Peña Nieto did not discuss who would pay for his proposed border wall, despite his   vow to compel Mexico to foot the bill. Slim’s mark can be seen all across Mexico City, from the glittering Museo Soumaya, an   building made of aluminum tiles and named after his late wife, to the Sanborns department stores that dot so many corners. His wealth amounts to a noticeable chunk of the country’s gross domestic product.  In a 2013 appearance CBS’s “Late Show With David Letterman,” Trump told the host that Slim was a “good guy” with “a lot of money. ” When Letterman detailed the towering nature of Slim’s fortune, however, Trump smiled. “I don’t feel so good when you mention Carlos Slim,” he said, “but that’s okay. ”  Read more:   Trump’s fight against    could carry price on both sides of border   Mexico to Trump: Those Carrier jobs are not the story   ‘Smart wall’ proponent seeks to shape Trump’s Mexico policy   Partlow reported from Tijuana, Mexico.

"," As a leading advocate for slashing legal immigration levels, Roy Beck has spent years on the political fringes of the debate in a country that has had dramatic growth in its   population over a  . Beck is executive director of NumbersUSA, an   nonprofit organization devoted to “stabilizing” the population. He has been marginalized in Washington as an eccentric figure whose views some consider xenophobic or even racist. In recent weeks, though,   Donald Trump’s early appointments, including the nominee for attorney general and two top White House advisers, are giving Beck hope that his positions are suddenly front and center at the highest levels of government. “We’ve been in the wilderness, and overnight we are not anymore,” Beck said. Trump, he added, “really did make some very strong statements about cutting immigration. That’s a total change. ” Throughout Western nations, societies are reexamining the merits of immigration in the wake of a global surge of refugees, terrorist attacks and struggling economies. In the United States, President Obama has warned against an overreaction to the forces of globalization and the political and economic turmoil in the Middle East and Europe. He has referred to the United States, repeatedly, as a “nation of immigrants. ”  But here, as in Europe, some of the most strident restrictionist voices have gained new political legitimacy amid a wave of populist anxiety of the kind that propelled Trump to his presidential victory. Trump campaigned on pledges to build a border wall, deport the undocumented and ban Muslim immigrants. And during a campaign speech in Phoenix last summer, he raised the specter of new policies to curtail legal immigration, citing concerns about foreign workers taking jobs and keeping wages down for the  . Trump noted that 59 million immigrants had come to the United States over the past 50 years, boosting the nation’s   population share from 4. 8 percent to 14 percent, according to Pew Research Center.  “Many of these arrivals have greatly enriched our country,” he said. “But we now have an obligation to them, and to their children, to control future immigration  —   as we have following previous immigration waves  —   to ensure assimilation, integration and upward mobility. ” Today, the U. S. government awards green cards to more than 1 million foreigners annually, granting them legal permanent residence. Groups such as NumbersUSA want to slash that by a half or more. In his speech, Trump expressed a desire to cut legal immigration levels to “within historical norms,” as measured by a share of the overall population, and he proposed a new federal commission to develop proposals to achieve it. The goal, he said, would be to “select immigrants based on their likelihood of success in U. S. society and their ability to be financially  . ” The new immigration system should establish “controls to boost wages and to ensure open jobs are offered to American workers first. ” Trump has echoed the views of Sen. Jeff Sessions ( .) who is perhaps the Senate’s most vocal immigration   and whom Trump has nominated as U. S. attorney general. Stephen Miller, a longtime Sessions aide who wrote most of Trump’s immigration speeches, has been named senior adviser to the president for policy in the Trump White House. And Stephen K. Bannon, Trump’s chief strategist, advocated for reducing legal immigration levels as editor of Breitbart News, a conservative site that reports extensively on the issue. “What we need now is immigration moderation: slowing the pace of new arrivals so that wages can rise, welfare rolls can shrink and the forces of assimilation can knit us all more closely together,” Sessions wrote in a Washington Post   last year. To immigrant rights advocates, such talk sounds like justification for pursuing “nativist and xenophobic” policies, said Marielena Hincapié, executive director of the National Immigration Law Center. She pointed to academic studies showing that immigrants spur economic growth and suggested that Trump and his aides are employing a false rationale as political cover to “take us back to [the policies of] previous centuries. ” The last time the United States significantly cut immigration levels was in 1924, after a public backlash over huge spikes of foreign workers during the Second Industrial Revolution prompted Congress to establish strict quotas based on “national origin. ” The new laws favored white immigrants from Northern and Western Europe, while severely restricting Jews from Southern and Eastern Europe, as well as Africans. Asians and Arabs were banned outright. Over the ensuing decades, U. S. immigration rates plunged to their lowest levels since the   War era  —   from more than 800, 000 immigrants a year between 1900 and 1910 to about 70, 000 a year between 1930 and 1940, according to federal data. In 1965, Congress replaced the   quota with a system focused on reuniting immigrant families that led to a massive spike in immigration levels. Under current policies, immigrants and their descendants will account for an additional 103 million people over 50 years, 88 percent of the nation’s population growth, according to Pew. “The question is whether having an immigration level higher than any other country in the world but half of what we have now signifies any kind of qualitative change in who we are as a country,” said Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, another group that advocates for reducing immigration levels. “That 500, 000 or 400, 000 immigrants a year is somehow   but 1 million is America. ” During unsuccessful immigration reform efforts under President George W. Bush in 2007 and Obama in 2013, Beck and Krikorian were reliable voices of opposition to bipartisan legislative proposals that featured a path to citizenship for the nation’s 11 million illegal immigrants. But to them, the fate of the undocumented  —   which has become the major flash point on Capitol Hill  —   obscures their more fundamental goal of reducing overall immigration flows. A third major restrictionist group, the Federation for American Immigration Reform, has spent decades lobbying Congress to cap immigration at 300, 000 per year. All three organizations were started with funding from John Tanton, a Michigan doctor who has professed support for eugenics, the pseudoscience claiming that some racial groups are inherently superior. But Beck rejected as “nonsense” the notion that his group’s views are based on race. “It is nationalist, not nativist,” he said. “It’s not where you were born, but are you a member of this national community?” NumbersUSA touts as its spiritual godmother the late Barbara Jordan, a Texas Democrat who was the first African American woman elected to Congress from the Deep South. In the   before her death in 1996, Jordan chaired a bipartisan federal commission that recommended to the Clinton administration cutting annual green cards from 675, 000 a year to 550, 000. Clinton never moved forward on the proposal. In an ad that aired during the Republican and Democratic presidential primary debates last year, NumbersUSA featured a clip of Jordan’s testimony that “the commission finds no national interest in continuing to import   and unskilled workers to compete in the most vulnerable parts of our labor force. ” Studies have shown that immigrants who arrive legally boost the economy over the long term and that many have higher levels of education than   Americans. Proponents of lowering immigration levels “are just interested in coming up with reasons not to have people who are different,” said Stuart Anderson, an adjunct scholar at the conservative Cato Institute who served as counselor to the commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service under Bush. Anderson said the 1924 law that slashed immigration rates was “hardly a model of good governance. It was one of the ugliest periods of the eugenics movement and extremely  . ” Trump advisers emphasized that limiting immigration would benefit all American workers, including blacks and Hispanics. One aide said the   has not specified a target immigration level because he wants to consult members of Congress. The aide  —   who spoke on the condition of anonymity to address the debate because he was not authorized to talk about the issue on the record  —   said Trump favors a revamped system that would prioritize immigrants with high education levels and expertise in   industries such as technology. The 1965 immigration act sought to build in preferences for skilled foreign laborers, but the system overwhelmingly favors family reunification. Of the 1 million foreigners granted permanent legal residence in 2014, 647, 000  —   about    —   received green cards based on family ties, according to the Department of Homeland Security. Just 152, 000 permanent arrivals were  . In addition, 134, 000 refugees and asylum seekers received green cards, and 54, 000 more were distributed in an annual diversity lottery for underrepresented countries, many in Africa. Critics have said the rules encourage “chain migration,” the tradition of immigrants seeking to bring extended family members. The Trump aide cited as a model Canada’s system of awarding points to immigrants based on education, job skills, language proficiency, age and other criteria. If he pursues a legislative push, Trump is likely to run into major resistance, including from some fellow Republicans and members of the business community, which has supported   programs for foreign workers and their families. But Beck said he is counting on Trump. “We have a citizen army,” said Beck, whose group has more than 6 million Facebook followers. “We will be acting and pushing members of Congress. We’re not going into this expecting him to disappoint us. ”  "

","  WARSAW  —    The Law and Justice Party rode to power on a pledge to drain the swamp of Polish politics and roll back the legacy of the previous administration. One year later, its patriotic revolution, the party proclaims, has cleaned house and brought God and country back to Poland.  Opponents, however, see the birth of a   Age  —   one that, as   Donald Trump prepares to move into the White House, is a harbinger of the power of populism to upend a Western society. In merely a year, critics say, the nationalists have transformed Poland into a surreal and insular place  —   one where   conspiracy theories and de facto propaganda distract the public as democracy erodes.  In the land of Law and Justice,   is king. Polish scientists are aghast at proposed curriculum changes in a new education bill that would downplay evolution theory and climate change and add hours for “patriotic” history lessons. In a Facebook chat, a top equal rights official mused that Polish hotels should not be forced to provide service to black or gay customers. After the official stepped down for unrelated reasons, his successor rejected an international convention to combat violence against women because it appeared to argue against traditional gender roles. Over the weekend, Warsaw convulsed in street protests amid allegations that the Law and Justice party had illegally forced through a budget bill even as it sought to restrict media access to Parliament.      (Reuters)   Cheered on by religious conservatives, the new government has defunded public assistance for in vitro fertilization treatments. To draft new   classes in schools, it tapped a contraceptives opponent who argues that condom use increases the risk of cancer in women. The government is proffering a law that critics say could soon be used to limit opposition protests.      Yet nothing has shocked liberals more than this: After a year in power, Law and Justice is still by far the most popular political party in Poland. It rides atop opinion polls at roughly 36 percent  —   more than double the popularity of the ousted Civic Platform party. “The people support us,” boasted Adam Bielan, Law and Justice’s deputy speaker of the Senate. Trump is promising a tax code rework that could trigger a bonanza of cash rebates for Americans. In Poland, Law and Justice put cash in pockets in other ways, but always while merging social conservatism and nationalism with populist economics. The new government doled out money to families with children. They also slashed Poland’s retirement age  —   to as young as 60 for women and 65 for men. Opponents call such actions the “buying” of support, moves that will only drive up Polish debt and masquerade a   power grab that could entrench Law and Justice for years. But right now, for many Poles, nationalism has never felt so good. “We are living in this   environment where you can say and do anything and people don’t seem to care,” said Jacek Kucharczyk, president of the   Institute of Public Affairs. Now they’re true believers The road to Law and Justice country runs an hour outside cosmopolitan Warsaw, down a dirt path in the hamlet of Krupia Wolka. Once there, pass the   playground of a   house and meet Pawel and Maria Wiechowski.  High school sweethearts, they married back in 1992.     decades and 10 children later, they’re still deeply Catholic  —   and still struggling financially.  Maria, a therapist for autistic children, quit work when   costs exceeded what she earned. Pawel, a craftsman, makes intricate moldings for ceilings and walls. Their parents helped them buy their   dream home in the country, so they’re  . But he hasn’t had work in two months. During dry spells before, the couple would mothball their    VW van to save on gas, and the kids would walk to school. But in the era of Law and Justice, there’s no need. The new government program for families is the Wiechowskis’ life raft; it offers them a monthly cash payout worth nearly $1, 000. “Right now, that’s 100 percent of our income,” Pawel said. “Some people criticize the child benefit and say it’s a government handout. It’s not. It is support for traditional families. ” Pawel voted for Law and Justice last year as “the lesser of two evils. ” But now he’s a true believer. “In the United States, you had the same choice, picking the lesser of two evils,” he said. “I wasn’t sure a year ago either, but now I see how right we were. ” Embracing the new government, to some measure, also means buying into the disturbing worldview it sells: You can only trust a Pole  —   even then, only some. And the party’s views have never been more effectively disseminated. The national broadcaster in Poland would often tilt toward the party in power. But following its victory, Law and Justice launched an unprecedented purge of journalists at the channel, turning it into what opponents describe as a propaganda machine where conspiracy theories flourish. It recently ran a piece on the health risks of child vaccinations.  Conservative Catholic radio and television, meanwhile, is abuzz with the reopening of an investigation into the 2010 plane crash that killed   Lech Kaczynski, his wife and 94 others. The crash was blamed on human error at the time. But Jaroslaw Kaczynski  —   the late president’s twin brother and Law and Justice’s powerful party chief  —   appears certain it was a coverup. Was it? “We are considering the possibility,” Pawel said with a nod. The new government is also skeptical of the Paris climate change agreement to cut carbon emissions and has pulled support for Polish wind and solar farms. At the same time, it is pumping more money into coal.  “Who really knows what is causing global warming?” Pawel said. “And Poland needs the coal industry. ” Maria was always more concerned with the spread of liberal values, which Law and Justice has, she said, rightly nipped in the bud. There is no more talk in Poland, for instance, of offering any legal rights to   couples. Earlier this year, the office of a lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender group in Warsaw was badly vandalized. Police never caught the perpetrators. “Homosexuality was quiet before, then they tried to normalize it,” she said. “You don’t see that happening now. ”  Are they concerned about allegations the new government is distracting the public as it chips away at Polish democracy? “No,” she said. “I think they’re just cleaning house. ” ‘Where is all this going?’ On a frigid recent evening in Warsaw, Monika Mizolebska, a museum researcher, stoically marched with thousands of other Poles to protest the new government. This is the street opposition  —   the people terrified by what they see unfolding in Poland. Already, the new government has taken steps to limit the power of the constitutional court, chipping away, critics say, at checks and balances. A new draft law would also allow   governors the right to decide on future permits for demonstrations.  “I’m here marching because it may be the last time we’re allowed to,” she said. “I don’t think many of us really understand what’s happening in Poland. ” The mother of a    daughter, Mizolebska said she is deeply concerned about what sees as an attack on women’s reproductive rights. A   abortion ban  —   women and doctors faced up to five years in jail  —   was defeated in October after a massive street protest. But she fears it may yet come back. “The government wants women to be mothers, to be housewives, but my daughter wants to be a writer, maybe a journalist,” she said. “But what chance does she have here? In these conditions?” She is also concerned about a new proposed school curriculum the Polish Academy of Sciences says will marginalize evolution theory by reducing its prominence in some grades. Sciences more generally would receive less time, in favor of more hours for Polish history.  “I can’t believe it’s 2016 and we’re still talking about whether to teach evolution,” she said, shaking her head. “Where is all this going? I’m afraid. ”  Ewa Galica in Warsaw contributed to this report.       "
142340,217785,Trump’s nominee for ambassador to Israel is unfit to serve,Washington Post,Jeremy Ben-Ami,2016-12-19,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161220002023/https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/trumps-nominee-for-ambassador-to-israel-is-unfit-to-serve/2016/12/19/5b6ffa08-c543-11e6-bf4b-2c064d32a4bf_story.html
","   Jeremy   is founder and president of J Street.           As the Nazis rolled into Vienna in 1938, my father was helping boats full of Jews escape down the Danube River. He had been sent to Vienna by Menachem Begin and the Irgun, the Jewish freedom fighting movement, to save Jews from the Nazis. The operation he ran is credited with saving thousands, maybe tens of thousands, of lives. At the same time, my mother and her family escaped Vienna in 1938, not down the river, but over the Swiss mountains. Her grandmother and many cousins weren’t so lucky. They are among the 6 million Jews lost in the Holocaust. So when David Friedman,   Donald Trump’s nominee to be ambassador to Israel, attacks me and Jews who share my politics on Israel as “worse than kapos” and not really Jews, it’s not only a horrific insult to my parents’ memory but also a stinging indictment of the character and the fitness to serve of the man who uttered those words. The term “kapo” refers to Jewish prisoners who were elevated by Nazi guards to supervise concentration camp operations. What views do I hold that could evoke such hate? I believe that a   solution to the   conflict is an existential necessity if Israel is to remain a Jewish homeland and that expansion of West Bank settlements risks Israel’s security and its democratic character. As important, I believe ruling as an occupying power over millions of Palestinians for 50 years while denying them their rights is not only strategically unwise but also morally unjustifiable. Friedman, on the other hand, thinks the idea of two states is “an illusion. ” He played a role in erasing support for the idea from the Republican Party platform this summer. He has actively worked to prevent the creation of a Palestinian state on the West Bank as president of an American nonprofit that raises money, with U. S. taxpayer support, to expand the West Bank settlement enterprise. It’s an understatement to say that Friedman and I are on opposite ends of the political spectrum. I recognize that Trump has the right to choose ambassadors who share his views.  Even though Friedman’s views completely contradict bipartisan U. S. policy for the past five decades, that’s not sufficient reason for the Senate to reject his nomination. Friedman’s lack of any policy or diplomatic experience (he has been Trump’s bankruptcy lawyer) is also not, alone, a basis for rejection. The appointment of political allies to ambassadorships is common, and we can be grateful that at least Friedman knows where Israel is. But never before has a diplomatic novice been placed in this sensitive post, where a single wrong word or move could pour fuel on fires already burning in the region. The Constitution requires that the Senate provide advice and consent for presidential appointments, including Friedman’s. Throughout the campaign, senators from both parties did provide advice to Trump. Many saw his words and style as unacceptable, urging him to strike a more unifying, presidential tone. Yet senators’ votes count no more than the rest of the citizenry’s in a general election. When it comes to the appointment of Friedman as ambassador to Israel, however, Senate votes are the only ones that do count. Senators have the opportunity to say that the tone and the nature of the discourse that people such as Friedman engage in have no place in U. S. government. The Senate should take this opportunity to deliver this message to future generations about the nature and the limits of acceptable political discourse in a healthy democracy. No one should serve as an ambassador of this great country after leveling baseless charges of   against a sitting president, as Friedman has, accusing a senior aide to a former secretary of state of being an agent of the Muslim Brotherhood or engaging regularly in offensive religious attacks, even when they’re against his own people. On behalf of my    who drove trucks through gunfire in 1948 to break the siege of Jerusalem, and my parents, who are buried on Jerusalem’s Mount of Olives, I will do everything I can to expunge rhetoric such as Friedman’s from my community’s debate over Israel. And as an American, I will do everything I can to ensure that my country is never represented in my family’s homeland by someone who treats people in a way that is anathema to the Jewish and democratic values on which I was raised.

142341,217786,Dear liberal celebrities: You’re not helping,Washington Post,Paul Waldman,2016-12-19,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161220002023/https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2016/12/19/dear-liberal-celebrities-youre-not-helping/
","     The members of the electoral college make their votes official Monday, and many people have been imploring the ones committed to Donald Trump to cast their ballots for someone, anyone, else. Among those lending their voices are a group of celebrities you might have seen in this video, in which Martin Sheen, Debra Messing, B. D. Wong, Bob Odenkirk, Moby and a bunch of other famous entertainers earnestly explain how the time has come for the electoral college to serve its original purpose, or at least make a statement of Americans’ collective unease about Trump. That’s only the latest entry in a campaign that was particularly heavy on celebrity involvement. The Democratic convention featured a parade of celebrities, many of whom also held   fundraisers for Hillary Clinton. Katy Perry probably appeared more often on the campaign trail with Clinton than Tim Kaine did. There were a bunch of videos, some of them quite clever and funny, like this one that parodied “We Are the World”  collaborations in order to urge Trump’s defeat, or this one that just encouraged people to vote. Republicans got into the act too  —   who could have predicted that the GOP convention would combine the blinding star power of Scott Baio and Antonio Sabato Jr.?  —   but this is an overwhelmingly liberal phenomenon. And while liberal celebrities get a lot of predictable scorn from the right for their political involvement, I’m here as a liberal to say: You’re not helping. I say this with affection, because your hearts are in the right place. You see a critical political moment, and like millions of other people, you ask yourself: What can I do? And while anyone can knock on doors or go to a protest or donate a few dollars, you think: Well, I’m famous. People pay attention to me. If I and some other famous people put up a YouTube video, millions of people will watch it. I can use my fame as a tool to spread the message. That sounds sensible, but what most celebrities seem to miss when they engage in these kinds of efforts is that there’s a difference between attention and persuasion. Yes, you can get millions of people to watch your video. But does that actually persuade them to change their votes to your preferred candidate, or turn out to vote when they would otherwise have stayed home? There’s precious little evidence that it does. Entertainers have been endorsing presidential candidates for nearly a century, dating back at least to Al Jolson’s support of Warren G. Harding in 1920 (for you kids, Jolson was basically the Beyoncé of his day). Harry Belafonte cut an ad for JFK. Mary Tyler Moore testified to Jimmy Carter’s feminist bona fides. But since social scientists have been able to research this question in a systematic way, they haven’t been able to find much positive impact of these endorsements (though Oprah Winfrey’s primary endorsement of Barack Obama in 2008 is an exception). There is, however, evidence that they produce a backlash. While that can happen on either side, it’s particularly acute with liberal celebrities, because their involvement in the campaign reinforces precisely the argument Republicans are trying to make, which is that Democrats are the party of the “elite”  —   not the economic elite, but an intellectual and cultural elite supposedly alien from the values and interests of ordinary, “heartland” (read: white) Americans. One simply cannot overstate the importance of this argument to the Republican case, because it’s what allows them to shift attention from all the ways they advance the interests of the wealthy and powerful. When Democrats say, “Our opponents oppose raising the minimum wage and want to cut taxes for billionaires,” Republicans respond with, “Pshaw, just what you’d expect from a bunch of snooty college professors and Hollywood liberals who look down their noses at you and your values. Don’t trust the liberal elite!” Every new video with a parade of stars telling people to vote Democratic makes the Republicans’ case for them, irrespective of its actual content. The unspoken message is always that liberal elites love Democrats, so Democrats must not be on the side of regular people. This was never going to be more true than it was in 2016, when the Republican candidate was so explicitly telling voters to despise the elites. I’m sure this isn’t what you celebrities want to hear  —   after all, you’re just trying to help. But the good feelings people have toward your talents and personality just aren’t transferable into political decisions. There are contexts in which fame can be an effective tool, like bringing attention to an otherwise ignored issue. But a presidential campaign isn’t one of those contexts. To be fair, there are some celebrities (George Clooney comes to mind) who understand this difference and are strategic about where they get involved publicly and privately. But most don’t seem to get it. To them, I say: If you really want to help, feel free to knock on doors or man the phone banks. You should certainly give money, which is something you’ve got, and encourage the other rich people you know to do the same. But you have to understand that effective political action isn’t just about doing the thing that makes you feel good, even if that’s what a healthy portion of all political action is motivated by. It’s about doing the things that will have the most impact and avoiding what might backfire. To make just one suggestion, folks in Hollywood might do better to use their storytelling skills to produce effective ads and videos that don’t actually feature celebrities. Entertainment can be quite effective at changing people’s outlooks and making them question their assumptions, but not when you try to beat them over the head with what you want them to think. After the election, Tina Fey said, “I think the real reason that Hillary lost  —   and it’s the thing that people are afraid to talk about: not enough celebrity music videos urging people to vote . . . I just think if there had been, like, one more funny rap, or like, another Hamilton parody, or something. Just like a little more hustle from Liz Banks, and we coulda taken Michigan. ” It’s a funny joke, because it captures how absurd it was to think that stuff would actually work. That doesn’t mean celebrities shouldn’t get involved; they should, just like everyone should. But they need to be smarter about it."
142342,217787,Megyn Kelly: ‘Fox was not without sin’ in 2016 campaign coverage,Washington Post,Erik Wemple,2016-12-19,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161220002023/https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/wp/2016/12/19/megyn-kelly-fox-was-not-without-sin-in-2016-campaign-coverage/
","         In the tour for her new book “Settle For More,” Fox News host Megyn Kelly has spoken at length about a certain progression over her career. After claiming that she was sexually harassed in the   by Fox News chief Roger Ailes, Kelly reported the incidents to a supervisor and then put her head down. When the matter arose again this past summer after former host Gretchen Carlson sued Ailes for sexual harassment, Kelly spoke up forcefully in a review conducted by the prominent law firm Paul Weiss  —   a review that resulted in the ouster of Ailes. “I worked my tail off for the next ten years. I established myself as a serious person. I built my own power,” writes Kelly in “Settle for More. ” “And when the allegations about Roger hit, I used it. ” That same assertive Megyn Kelly last Wednesday answered questions from the Erik Wemple Blog about “Settle for More” and adjacent topics, including the apparent bidding war for her services. “I do feel fortunate to have some great options,” she told this blog, though she professed little confidence in the state of reporting on her next step. “I’ve been just dismayed to see these reports which are completely just based on speculation or based on, I don’t know, maybe some random unnamed network executive someplace who wants to see his alleged information in the paper. ” Her Fox News contract expires next year. Wherever Kelly lands, she wants to be home with her three children and husband, Doug Brunt, during the time she’s now gearing up for polemical showdowns on her 9 p. m. show, “The Kelly File. ” “I want to see my kids for dinner, I want to put them down at night, I want to see their soccer games after school,” she says. The interview covered a range of stuff, including Kelly’s “America’s Newsroom” collaboration with Fox News host Bill Hemmer; her mother, Linda; diversity on the staff of “The Kelly File”; Fox News and women’s legs; her support for new   host Tucker Carlson; her assessment of Fox News’s campaign coverage; and a lot more. The interview preceded news that Kelly’s executive producer, Tom Lowell, would be leaving his role for a promotion to Fox News VP and managing editor of news. One note before rolling out the transcription: Over the years this blog has published laudatory posts on Kelly as well as a number of sharply critical ones. TV news personalities, even when peddling books, don’t always enjoy sitting for a    session with a proven critic, but Kelly was    generous with her time and patient with our inquiries.      On Wednesday, Dec. 14, the Erik Wemple Blog conducted a phone interview with FOX News anchor Megyn Kelly. This is a part of their conversation. (Adriana   Washington Post)   Here’s the Q&A (with some edits for length and clarity): ERIK WEMPLE BLOG: How’s it feel to be in the midst of a big network bidding war, which is what I understand is going on? MEGYN KELLY: Listen, without confirming or denying the premise of your statement, I’ll say this: I do feel fortunate to have some great options. I feel humbled by the fact that there’s any interest in me at all, Erik. I don’t see myself as some television star, I see myself as a girl from Albany. So it’s a great business; it’s a dream job. And I’m very glad that I have chance to work here, whether it’s at Fox or another channel. Hard to get a job in TV news, so I haven’t lost sight of that. EWB: We’ve seen a lot of reports, one that there’s a bidding war, another that there isn’t. Any advice on where to put the hot and cold on those two? KELLY: No, I don’t want to weigh in on it. I’ve been dismayed to see these reports and so many from reporters who have no idea about the facts, you know? And I’ve just tried to hold my fire because it’s nobody’s business and it’s not appropriate for public discussion. You know? I mean, what happened in my case is my boss, Lachlan Murdoch, came to me with a generous offer and I was honest with him and said, “I need some time to think it over. ” It was long in advance of the date my contract expired and I just, you know, a lot has changed since I last signed with Fox and I needed to give it the thought and consideration it deserved and he was very kind about that and gave me permission to see what was out there so I could check out the landscape knowingly, as opposed to blindly. I could evaluate his offer, I should say, knowingly and not blindly. And now I’ve done that and now I’m going to take some time and give it the thought and consideration it deserves. But I’ve been just dismayed to see these reports which are completely just based on speculation or based on, I don’t know, maybe some random unnamed network executive someplace who wants to see his alleged information in the paper, but as I say, don’t believe a thing unless you hear from me directly because there’s a lot of bad info going on out there. EWB: You write that your heart aches when you get too deep into work stuff  —   and you note that your family is programmed to expect to see less of you during prime campaign season. Is there anything that you’re seeking in either your new contract at Fox News or in a contract at a competitor organization that would bring yet greater balance to your life? KELLY: Oh, my next deal is all about greater balance. I mean, that’s  —   I had professional success, right? Thankfully. And I feel like I’m at a level in my business where I’ve established myself as a professional. And the one thing I haven’t managed to do is find a way to achieve a better balance. You know, it started off fine, this particular job and my family situation because my three little ones were very small when I started “The Kelly File. ” They were 3, 2 and newborn. So, you know, I don’t know if you have kids, but you spend the day at home with them. EWB: I have a 10 and I have a 13. KELLY: Yeah, so you know how that goes. You can see them all day. But then they start school and now two out of my three and soon three out of my three are going to be in school from 8 a. m. in the morning till 3:30 p. m. So that’s not good enough, that’s when I leave for Fox. And I need to do better. EWB: You write in the book that you get to go to daytime school events. It seems as though, you know, you left the legal profession, you became famous, you make a lot of money and you get to go to your kids’ daytime school events: How is that not a    and what more would you be seeking on the balance front? KELLY: Yeah, well it is a win but it isn’t good enough. I want to see my kids for dinner, I want to put them down at night, I want to see their soccer games after school. I want to get to know the parents who take their kids to some of these events, and not all the time. We all feel that to some extent, but my problem in my current role is I see them in the morning and . . . I take them to school but unless there’s a school event that I can attend, I might not see them at all for the rest of the day until they’re sleeping in their beds at night. EWB: Do they call you at work while you’re trying to get ready for “The Kelly File”? KELLY: Yeah, we talk on the phone, so listen: It’s not that I don’t understand working parents make sacrifices; they all do, whether they’re TV anchors or not. It’s just a question of what works for any given individual and all I’m saying and I’ve said it publicly is that this particular balance that I’ve struck right now is not good enough for me. I will tell you that Fox has always been good about working things like that out. And I don’t have any doubt that they’d be good to me on that front here too, so that’s one of the things we’ll figure out before I have to make up my mind. EWB: Sticking with the family theme, you talk in the book about how your mom  —   you never discussed [with her] really that much about the bullying you sustained around seventh grade. Did your mom learn new things about you through “Settle for More”? KELLY: She did; she was not happy with me when she saw the extent of that bullying. Every time I talk to her, she says, “Why didn’t you tell me, why didn’t you tell me? I would have given those girls what for. ” You know, she’s still a protector. But I tell her the truth, which is, I was ashamed. I was ashamed. I was taking it as a measure of myself; I thought it was saying something about me, as opposed to just something about the bullies. I just didn’t have the emotional maturity to understand that wasn’t the case. So anyway, my mom is sweet and she wants to give somebody what’s for to this day. So she learned a lot on that and she learned a lot about the   with Donald Trump from the book. I talked to my mom about it as it was going on  —   she was among the few people whose advice I did seek in handling that whole thing. But unless you lived in my apartment and were over the age of 40, you didn’t get the daily download. There was only one person who I shared everything with, and that was my husband. So my mom was, I think, pretty shocked to hear the extent of it. EWB: As much praise as your mother and late father and many other people get in the book, hard work gets a lot of praise, too. And your advice for women who hit the glass ceiling is to work harder and harder. And solid though that advice is, there are some structural impediments, as I noted in a blog post a few weeks back. There was a  . org study talking about how women don’t get a chance, don’t get mentorships  —   something that goes beyond their work ethic. Is this too simple or do you think it’s the best advice and the best solution at this point in time? KELLY: No, what you said is 100 percent true, and there’s no question that to some extent there are structural disadvantages built in, not just for women but for other minority groups who don’t hold power at the executive level either at the company or in the industry. My position is not just “Oh, okay, anyone can overcome those. ” It’s just as we work to get more women and people in minority groups at higher levels in positions of power, what are our options? And in my experience, as a person who’s been in the professional world for some 25 years now, my experience is that the best core solution, the best solution for us as we change the structure, is to power through with great work product. Because in my experience, the more you lecture those running the companies on how they need to give more breaks to women or other minority groups and be more   to their work products and perhaps question themselves on a double standard, the more some of those people shut down to your messaging. I’m not saying it’s right; I’m just saying you can very easily get labeled as someone who sees everything through a prism of race or gender or what have you. So we have to walk a fine line. It’s sad but it’s the truth. So in my own circumstances, and trust me when I tell you I’ve experienced plenty of sexism in the workplace, but I’ve nevertheless managed to make it to the top in two different industries, and so for me, what I’m saying to other women is, “This is how I did it. ” EWB: You mentioned in one of your interviews, and this is part of the book, too  —   overcoming adversity, that children these days are becoming pampered, wusses or whatever. Parents are sheltering them from hardship and you cited the bullying you yourself experienced. But at the same time, Dan Savage talks about how bullying can push people toward suicide, and bullying is particularly acute for teens these days. KELLY: 100 percent. EWB: Are you saying that bullying can sort of be a good experience, one that fortifies you, or are you saying that the crackdown is worse than the problem these days? KELLY: No, when I talk about Cupcake Nation on my show or in my book, it’s not about bullying at all, and in fact in the book you’ll see I argue that especially when it comes to young people, I believe an adult must intervene. You really have to. Kids just don’t have the emotional maturity to deal with it and it can be extremely damaging; it can be  . So I see that as a special thing that people need to be very careful in how they handle bullying. . . . [At a Midwest university] they were literally telling the college students to call campus police if someone offended them. If somebody offended them! Now that’s taking it too far. Somebody saying something offensive to you, or insulting to you, is not pleasant, but it’s part of life. And my belief is we need to shore ourselves up, and our kids up and our younger generation up to understand how to deal with that unpleasant reality, because we won’t always be there to protect them. And you know, I for one want my own kids to know how to handle that. I see it as this: I send my kids to school not only to learn how to read and write and do math, but also to develop socially. So if there’s a negative interaction between my child and another child, what I want to know is, how was it handled, what lessons came out of it and of course, is my child okay? And then I’ll talk to them after the fact, but Doug [Brunt] and I talk about this all the time. Those situations are not all bad because it’s an experience our kid had to navigate and now hopefully can fold into the memory bank so he or she has the skills the next time it happens. But if we jump in and try to protect them from it, it doesn’t build anything for them. It is an important distinction; I never say this about bullying, which I know firsthand can leave scars that do not heal. EWB: One of the things you talk about in the book: In [media] interview after interview, you had to sort of credit Roger Ailes, but in the book you give a big nod to Bill Hemmer, who is also one of my favorite people on cable news. The takeaway I get is that as much as you appreciated Roger  —   he gave you those two maternity leaves, promotions during them, and I understand the full complexity that you mention with respect to Ailes. But here’s a guy Bill Hemmer  —   you tell the story in the book about how he sort of mentored you on how to handle breaking news alerts during your show as opposed to just handling more stable stories. How important was he and what exactly did he mean to you in terms of your ascension at Fox News? KELLY: He had a huge role in my development because we were not only partners; we were in some respects mentor and mentee, me being the mentee. By the time I left that show, we had become more of a partnership. But when I started, I was as green as they come. I had never anchored a show before, other than to sit in a couple of times here and there on some substitute anchoring. But I’d never been a TV anchor before; I’d never been employed as a TV anchor. So, I mean, Hemmer is the ultimate gentleman. I have never seen him have anything but a kind word and a generous lens for people. If he gets frustrated or angry or upset, I have never seen it, and I have spent a lot of time with the guy. EWB: So his whole persona   is not an act. KELLY: Absolutely not. And I’ve seen him  —   on TV news, as you know, it can be stressful. Breaking news comes, throw out the rundown, it’s rolling thunder; things are firing at you; the rundown’s gone or the guest is gone or it’s dark air; you don’t know what’s happening. Bill used to call it “boot camp TV” what we were doing on “America’s Newsroom” and he was right. But, man, he’s unflappable. Sometimes that’s when you see [people’s] dark side, when the stress hits and they start yelling at people and they’re nasty. NEVER. I’ll give you an example, just of Bill Hemmer which sums up his personality. It was at my engagement party to Doug. Hemmer was there. Doug’s parents were there; they were 70 and 80, thereabouts. . . . They needed to leave. [Confusion arises over how they would get a ride] Hemmer steps in and he’s like, “I will get them a taxi. ” So he takes Dr. and Mrs. Brunt out to the sidewalk, he hails them a taxi, he gets them into the taxi, he gives the address to the taxi driver, then he tells the taxi driver what radio station to put on because he thinks Dr. and Mrs. Brunt would enjoy their   ride more with this music in the background. Doug’s dad has since passed away but his mother still lives for Bill Hemmer. EWB: I was interested to see the photographs in your book. And you have a photograph of your staff and it sprung a question for me: You do all kinds of aggressive coverage, including on race. That staffing picture looked pretty much white, although there could be a couple of minorities in there. Do you think that for as aggressive as you are on racial issues, that you could use more diversity on the staff? KELLY: Well, I don’t know about the first part of your question. That’s not the reason. The reason to have more racial diversity on any team is because it’s helpful to have different perspectives on any issue. And I also believe that. It’s easier said than done, unfortunately. At Fox we started  —   this is one of Roger’s good legacies, the Ailes Apprentice Program, and that’s been pretty good about getting more people of color into the TV news ranks. But we don’t have enough, that’s just a fact. We don’t. And we can do better at that, just like most of the news networks can. EWB: Do you have anyone who’s African American on the staff at this point? KELLY: Not at the moment. Don’t hold me to that, Erik, because I’m probably forgetting somebody. Definitely we have some crew who work with me who are African American but . . . to be perfectly honest with you, I have never asked. We . . . have a couple of   people . . . I don’t know if they identify as mixed race or African American, so I don’t want to guess. EWB: Obviously you know a lot about the whole New Black Panther issue, Philadelphia; you were famous for that. I didn’t see much mention in the book, but now, eight years later, a couple CNN   commentators cited that incident sort of in the context of Trump talking about a rigged election. Do you think that’s a fair reading of the New Black Panther issue, sort of as grist for justifying Trump’s claims of the possibility of a rigged election? KELLY: What do you mean, that guys like those New Black Panthers [inaudible] at the polls? EWB: I believe Kayleigh McEnany said something to the effect that Trump “doesn’t want a scenario where there’s New Black Panthers outside with guns, essentially like intimidating people from coming into the polls. ” KELLY: That was not a widespread incident as far as we knew. That was a couple of   who showed up causing a bunch of nonsense at one Philadelphia polling station. I wouldn’t say you could extrapolate that to a general concern, especially because I don’t believe we saw it again in 2012. I believe it was these two guys trying to make a point in 2008; their point was made and I assume they understood the ramifications of it after the Department of Justice got involved. EWB: Do you think that your pushing that incident is where people draw their memory from? KELLY: Come on, Erik, next question. EWB: No? I just wondered. I mean, you did scores of segments on it. KELLY: You should take those scores of segments numbers with a huge grain of salt because that was some tabulation done by Media Matters that included teases. Teases! EWB: This is an interesting part of who you are as sort of a public figure. At one point in your book, you address Trump’s allegation that, I made her who she is . . . And there was some commentary out there saying that this was a sexist thing on Trump’s part. You said you had a different reaction. I gotta say: If that’s not sexist, what is? A guy telling you that his abuse makes you more of a commodity . . . KELLY: No, I’m not saying it wasn’t sexist. I’m just saying my reaction to it wasn’t, “Oh, what a sexist thing to say. ” It was just, “how ironic. ” The first thing I thought was, he wants credit for making my career when he is trying to destroy it. And he wants credit for making my career, when look at our relative advantages in life. I did not get a   or   loan from my dad. I did not grow up with silver spoon in my mouth. In fact, I lost my dad at a young age and had to put myself through school. I didn’t have a lot of the advantages Donald Trump had but I had the most important ones you can get, which are loving parents who cared about me and helped me develop a sense of self. But it certainly wasn’t Donald Trump’s doing. EWB: Absolutely. KELLY: It wasn’t that I didn’t understand that that comment could be perceived as sexist. It’s just my own reaction was, “Wow, that’s ironic. ” EWB: “Settle For More” cycles through a lot of very interesting details about how your network dealt with the mercurial Trump throughout the presidential campaign. One thing I noted was that he continued to appear on the “O’Reilly Factor” and “Hannity” and “Fox & Friends” even as he was attacking you. Did you ever ask management to say, “Hey, no O’Reilly, no Hannity, no ‘Fox & Friends’ till you make a visit to ‘The Kelly File’?” Because this looked to me  —   speaking of sexism  —   like a sexist cabal among guys: Sean Hannity, Roger Ailes, Bill O’Reilly. They were getting all these Trump interviews and you, who, I believe, is a much better interviewer, a much more penetrating journalist, would have made more news. Did you ever say, “Hey, why don’t we show some leadership here and don’t let Trump decide where he’s gonna go; we decide as a news network where he’s going to go, and I should be in that queue”? KELLY: No, I didn’t. I didn’t feel it was my place to try to interfere with Trump’s appearances or other people’s shows. The only thing I didn’t want, was I didn’t want him attacking me on my own network. I thought that was a reasonable place for me to draw a line, personally. And I thought that what happens outside of “The Kelly File” is for someone else to deal with, not me. I understood the position that management was in and that my colleagues were in because he was the  . He was very upset with me; there was of course no way he was going to come on with me. But what were they going to do: Ban the presidential   from all of Fox News until he decided he’d sit with me? I wouldn’t have expected them to do that. I had my own battles to fight and I didn’t feel the need to take on additional ones like that one and I understood the position my company was in. EWB: You have an interesting little paragraph in the book where you say that you continued to report on Trump  —   you and your staff tried your best to go down the middle and I think you were successful in that. It’s a very difficult thing to be attacked and to still give credit and to be fair in a situation like that. But there’s a paragraph where you said that some critics said you were being too tough on Trump. You said [in the book] something to the effect that “we merely stood out by comparison. ” Period. So there’s an unfinished thought there, Ms. Kelly. By comparison to what? KELLY: Well, I think that in particular in the primary season, very few people were offering any critical Trump coverage, virtually anywhere. It was stunning to me because I thought  —   and I’m not going to condemn my brethren in the news media specifically. I don’t want to call anybody out specifically  —   but what I’m saying is, we would look across the landscape to see whether anybody was meaningfully challenging him and we’d be a long time lookin’. For the reason I write in the book, because people were either entertained by him, didn’t perceive him as a serious candidate or were just enjoying the ratings that Trump brought. And in particular, some of these folks who put on his campaign rallies, Erik. His campaign rallies, not a policy speech, just rallies. Which we never would have done to Scott Walker or Hillary Clinton. Ever. And to me that seemed unfair to the other candidates and wrongheaded journalistically. EWB: That analysis applies to colleagues at your own network, correct? KELLY: Well, listen, Fox was not without sin in that department either. I can say that on “The Kelly File,” we did not do that. And listen, it was not the easiest thing to do because Trump rates. You pop up that campaign rally, you could let it roll for an hour and your ratings would shoot through the roof. Easy, done. Huge number. [inaudible] your average for the month. EWB: While we’re talking about the other cable networks, I thought that [Jake] Tapper and Chris Cuomo and a couple of other people on CNN did a good job of pushing Trump from the very beginning. I’m not saying that they necessarily had enough shots at him as O’Reilly and Hannity did. Gawker. com was merciless on you, called you a horrible person, facilitator of racism so on and so forth. In August, a chain of events that started with a privacy suit closed the site. You’re big on legal stuff  —   how do you process all of this? Was there any schadenfreude within Megyn Kelly about the death of Gawker. com? KELLY: I honestly can tell you that just hearing you say that about Gawker is the first I’ve heard about their attacks on me. I know what happened with them and Hulk Hogan, but that’s the first I’ve heard about their attacks on me because I do tend to avoid that stuff like the plague because I do believe it is the plague. I studiously avoid the darkest places of the Internet. Sometimes you can’t avoid it because you’re doing a legitimate news search and something pops up, but I don’t breathe that stuff in because I think it’s a carcinogen. EWB: Jon Stewart, he’s gone now from “The Daily Show,” and the departure has translated into less heat, less withering scrutiny of Fox News and CNN and MSNBC, to a lesser extent. They never seemed to miss a single contradiction in cable news. . . . Is that a form of accountability that the industry misses and needs? KELLY: I write a lot about Jon Stewart in “Settle for More,” and I just sort of try to give an example of how I felt his attacks were often unfair. Because you can’t get into it; as a news person, you can’t spend all your time responding to a Comedy Central star. It’s not what we do. However, and I’ve said publicly before many times, I thought Stewart was hilarious, except when he was attacking me, so it’s one of those, There but for the grace of God. I do think that there’s absolutely a role for media critics and Stewart was special among them and did it in a way that was so intelligent and entertaining. I don’t know whether there will ever be another like him. And for whatever it’s worth, we actually have a good relationship. I write in the book we moved on, not friends exactly but not enemies either. I would say we’ve only become closer to friends since that date years ago. However, I think part of that discussion these days is driven by a belief on some level that Stewart could have brought Trump down or perhaps he could have shamed some of the media into doing a better job of covering him honestly. And I don’t think that’s true. I think if Stewart had been his full self during this whole election, we would have wound up with the exact same result. And that’s just the nature of the way our country is built. Stewart had so many fans, but I’d venture to say they weren’t in most of the counties that went red in this presidential election. They tend to be in this echo chamber where the people who love you listen and the people who don’t, don’t. EWB: The litigation of Andrea Tantaros  —   Fox News was shown to have has some pretty strict book guidelines, and one of them requires 10 percent of net profits after your advance is earned out  —   that goes to the network. Does your contract include that provision? And everyone always has a book going  —   O’Reilly on manners, of all things, and Japan and Reagan; Bret Baier on Ike; Ainsley Earhardt on, I forgot, something or other. KELLY: Children. EWB: Children, right. Does the flogging of the books detract from news at Fox News? And this is an industry, isn’t it  —   a  ? What’s your take on it? KELLY: I don’t know  —   almost every journalist has written a book. It’s not just Fox News. You know, Jake Tapper, Anderson Cooper, you name it. I understand why you’re asking the question, because sometimes I look around cable news and it’s like you wonder whether you’re looking at anchors or authors. What is your primary role? I would say for me, I can tell you that HarperCollins certainly would have liked me to have pushed the book a lot before it came to sale. They really wanted me to get out there and start promoting it and I just didn’t feel comfortable doing that. So I mentioned it a couple of times. But for me, I felt uncomfortable. I said, ‘Look, when it’s out, I’ll promote it. I’ll promote the hell out of it.’ I have an obligation to try to get out there and sell it. And now I’ve done that. I feel like I’ve met my obligation to them. But I do think that, yeah, it can go on for a really long time and if it interferes in your viewers’ willingness to consume your show, because it’s supposed to be a straight news product or it’s supposed to be a news product of some sort, then it can be distracting. EWB: On the timing . . . you told Anderson Cooper that you didn’t want to float the book before the election because you didn’t want to become the story. KELLY: Well, I was the story; I didn’t want to become any more the story. EWB: Well, that’s the point, I mean, I think that’s a very honest response. But you were going to be the story anyway: Why not do an Oct. 15 release date and give voters more information for a critical decision, than Nov. 15 and not give those voters that critical information? I still don’t understand. KELLY: You have to understand that this isn’t just “Megyn Kelly, journalist, stumbles upon a news story. ” This is “Megyn Kelly, human being, woman, mother, wife, finds herself in the middle of a news story in which her safety was in danger, her children’s safety was in danger,” and I have actual responsibilities to the people who live in my home to make sure I didn’t do anything to make our situation worse, and I took those very seriously. I did not want to do anything that would chum up those shark waters I was already swimming in. And while I thought it was important to make a historical record of what Donald Trump had done  —   just as a matter of First Amendment issues and presidential politics, whether he won or not I thought it was important  —   I didn’t feel it was necessary to endanger my own safety or my children’s safety to do that. And I also didn’t want people to feel that I was trying to sink Donald Trump in any way, that I was trying to gum up his chances by hitting him with all these details at any point prior to the election. And I don’t believe in any way, shape or form that anything in this book would have stopped Donald Trump or changed his ascension to this office, but I do think it was important for me to tell it. So I think you should stop hitting me for not releasing it earlier and start praising me for releasing it at all. EWB: That’s very articulate, but I don’t think we as journalists  —   this is just a sort of journalist ethics discussion  —   I don’t think we as journalists should even get into the business of trying to figure out whether this will derail someone or not. I just think the only test is whether it’s relevant. KELLY: Well, I didn’t think it was  …    I didn’t think it would have an impact on the election one way or the other. I didn’t  —   I understood how there could be an appearance of impropriety, if you will, by some people who thought, “Okay, you’re doing it. ” Listen, I could have said some things about Hillary Clinton that would have been unfortunate for her, too. But I don’t want to interfere. I didn’t want to be part of this election at all. And to go out there and say, “I was under death threat for the entire year. ” Listen, I’d said enough that people knew that. But I didn’t have to get into the specifics of my security guards and the number of death threats and the people showing up at my home. That just wasn’t necessary. I’d given the   items; that’s all people needed to know. And I made sure they knew it. EWB: I just think there’s power in the narrative that you put in the book, when you put it all together in your voice. It’s extremely powerful. KELLY: I know, Erik, but be realistic. I have a     and   . We lived under armed guard for a year. We still have an armed guard. Why would I do something that might fan those flames within a month of a presidential election? How do you think that would have gone for me and my family? EWB: But isn’t the risk just as great now? KELLY: No, because the election is over. And I knew it would be over one way or the other. Either Trump would have lost and his supporters would have said, “Whatever. ” Or Trump would have won, and his supporters would say, “All right, whatever. ” EWB: So you’re not seeing the plume of abuse that you did during the campaign? KELLY: Not the same, no. Absolutely not the same, no. EWB: You mention in the book, and this is an interesting part . . . you say that there were anchors who did this   sort of thing with Trump [wherein they rehearse questions for an interview in advance of the interview]. But you don’t name them; who are they? KELLY: Obviously I’m not going to name them now because I chose not to do so in my book. EWB: I understand that you don’t want to name them, but you put it out there. I might just all of a sudden decide that that’s Anderson Cooper or that’s  —   take a name  —   Chris Hayes. Isn’t this the problem with anonymous sources that when you make such an allegation and don’t give any specificity, it just slimes the whole industry? KELLY: I don’t think so. I think people are smart enough to figure out who the likely candidates are. And in any event, this is not a nightly news report on “The Kelly File. ” It’s a book, I mean there’s a lot in there that  —   it’s not something I would report at night on Fox News, but it’s my take on a situation. And I think, again, this is something that people should know took place and you don’t need the names to know that there was corruption in the coverage of this race. That was deeply problematic. EWB: But everybody’s corrupt now. KELLY: I think any reasonable person knows which reporters to eliminate. EWB: I just think everybody is now slimed and that’s a problem with the media  —   that criticism takes place with such a broad brush that everybody gets the taint. KELLY: I don’t think that’s true. I don’t think that’s true at all. Look at Donald Trump: He loves to call out individual reporters by name, which leads to major problems in those reporters’ lives. I certainly don’t want to add to that myself. EWB: In the book, you write that Fox News critics were delighting in Roger Ailes’s downfall. And you said, “Perhaps it was the Fox News connection, but questions surfaced a little too frequently, asking why these women didn’t just quit. Why it took them so long to come forward,” you wrote. But that wasn’t just Fox News critics. [Fox News stalwart] Brit Hume also tweeted that same sentiment, and he is cited in the book as a great mentor. Isn’t that a reaction of just, like, guys? KELLY: Not all guys. EWB: Do you need to brush back Brit Hume as well? KELLY: I’m not going to make any comment about anything specific about Brit or what anybody else at my company said. But I do think that that   reaction is outdated and shortsighted. EWB: Yeah, I made the point at the time. I thought it was awful. KELLY: I know, and it was a great point. The   reaction to put the blame on the women is wrong, it’s wrong. We have to start talking honestly about this or it’s going to continue. As I’ve said in many interviews, you don’t get to ask me why I didn’t come forward sooner until you ask me whether there was a safe avenue for reporting at my company. Only if the answer to that question is “yes” do you get to ask me why I didn’t come forward. And I say that not for myself, Erik, because I did come forward. I say that for my fellow women at Fox News, who did not. And it’s not because they’re bad people or they enjoyed it or they asked for it or it was no big deal. It’s because in many cases they were scared  —   they were scared of what would happen to them. It’s very easy for some men and in some cases women to sit back and say with   hindsight, “  should have done more. ” But it doesn’t account for the reality. And by the way, that’s another reason why when people say now, “Would you advise young women now to come forward?” I have to stop and say, “Let’s be careful about this. ” Because as much as I, Megyn Kelly, with my contract and generous salary and my life all set could look back and start lecturing    women on how they must take a stand, it would be disingenuous. Because if there’s a    woman or a    woman who is in the position I was in at that time, it would be career suicide for her to do more. EWB: You mention that you were able to use the power that you’d stockpiled to speak out last summer, and I think that’s 100 percent true. Just a question, have you used any of that authority in the aftermath of Ailes’s departure to take aim at some of his legacies on air, like the   leg cam and the showcasing of women’s legs on air? There are other things that sort of outlast Roger Ailes. Are you using some of that credibility to take on those things, or have you done your part and you’re just focusing on “The Kelly File”? KELLY: I would say “assumes facts not in evidence. ” I’ve been there 12 years; I’ve never had a leg cam. Never. People are so focused on the appearances of Fox News anchors. Look across the networks. The Fox News anchors are lovely. They have an incredible combination of brains and beauty. And I think that’s one of the reasons people love watching them and listening to them. But we haven’t cornered the market on it. When I look at CNN, I see incredible combinations of brains and beauty there, too. And I have actually seen women’s legs and I don’t think there’s anything wrong with that, I don’t think that needs to be corrected. I think you can look at a woman’s legs while she delivers the news and still take her seriously . . . I believe I’m living proof of that. EWB: You see more women legs than men legs, right? I mean, I don’t know what Bill O’Reilly’s legs look like. KELLY: Welcome to humanity, Erik. That’s not a Fox News thing; that’s a human being thing.      On Wednesday, Dec. 14, the Erik Wemple Blog conducted a phone interview with FOX News anchor Megyn Kelly. This is a part of their conversation. (Adriana   Washington Post)   EWB: Tucker Carlson once asked on the set of “Fox & Friends”: “Are female breadwinners a recipe for disharmony within the home?” Now, the departure of Ailes was an inflection point for Fox News, meaning that there was perhaps a chance to take the programming in a different direction. Among the first major moves was to place this guy Carlson in the [ ] lineup. Did you lobby for him; if not, for whom did you? And to what extent does he represent a future that you’d like to see for Fox News? KELLY: As far as that particular comment, I refer you to my segment with Lou Dobbs and Erick Erickson. In which I famously challenged two guys at my network for saying exactly that kind of thing, so you know how I feel about comments like that. As far as Tucker, though, I don’t think you can sum up the man based on a comment here, a comment there. My experience with him has been nothing but delightful and respectful and I think he’s a huge talent and I am thrilled to see him hosting the 7 p. m. show  —   thrilled. EWB: Have you seen any of the misogyny that he did at the Daily Caller, including the website with all the titty clickbait and all that stuff? Does that matter to you? KELLY: I don’t  —   no, I haven’t see that and I don’t know what you’re referring to. It’s not like Tucker is at my house every night for dinner, but I have known him for a long time and what I’ve seen of him is a man who’s respectful and kind and loving and actually so far in his time at 7 p. m. I happen to know has reached out to a lot of women who may not get on camera that often to say, “Would you like a shot, would you like to come on? I think you’re great. ” All I’ve heard from my female colleagues is gratitude for new opportunities since he’s taken over that show. So I am a big Tucker fan and I believe he’s a good person and will continue to believe that until somebody gives me great reason to believe otherwise."
142343,217788,"If it’s going to work, ‘Star Wars’ needs to get past the Rebellion and the Empire",Washington Post,Alyssa Rosenberg,2016-12-19,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161220002023/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/act-four/wp/2016/12/19/if-its-going-to-work-star-wars-needs-to-get-past-the-rebellion-and-the-empire/
","     This post discusses the plot of “Rogue One,” which I reviewed last week, and much other “Star Wars” ephemera. In 2017, the war between the Galactic Empire and the Rebel Alliance will have been going on for 40 years, at least as counted in Earth time, ever since the opening music came up and introduced us to “Star Wars: Episode IV  —   A New Hope. ” The fictional conflict has been   by presidents and has moved a whole lot of movie tickets. But as “Rogue One,” the disappointing first   movie in the franchise, demonstrates, if “Star Wars” is going to be a truly great, continuing story, it’s going to have to find a way to bring the Galactic Civil War to a close and move on to something new. The basic contours of “Star Wars” movies, which form the core of the franchise, have been set for decades. These stories focus on the highest leadership of the Empire (or the First Order) and on the outskirts of the Rebel Alliance (or the Jedi Council, or the Resistance). On the Imperial side, Darth Vader’s (James Earl Jones) relationship with the Emperor (Ian McDiarmid) and the pull he feels from the Light side of the Force is the most important character arc, just as Anakin Skywalker’s (Jake Lloyd and Hayden Christensen) discovery as a Jedi and fall to the Dark side are the core of the original trilogy. It’s true that Vader isn’t exactly drafting legislation. But through his relationship with the Emperor, we at least get some sense of the grand strategy and personalities guiding the Empire. By contrast, while Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) is technically part of the Rebellion’s political leadership, we meet her when she’s stealing the Death Star plans, and she spends the rest of the original trilogy jaunting around with a space pirate (Harrison Ford’s Han Solo) and a    (Mark Hamill’s Luke Skywalker) because, let’s be honest, that’s where the action is. Mon Mothma (Caroline Blakiston in “Return of the Jedi,” and Genevieve O’Reilly in subsequent   outings) hangs around the margins of the “Star Wars” movies along with a number of generals, reminding us that there is actual civilian and military leadership working to build something sturdier in the background.      ”Rogue One: A Star Wars Story” picks up just before the original 1977 film, ”Star Wars: A New Hope,” and follows rebel forces who plot to steal the plans for the Death Star. (Walt Disney Pictures)   There are strong narrative reasons to preserve this dynamic: Watching the just and scrappy beat the evil and overwhelming is a lot of fun. And certainly, it’s easier to script a heist or a dogfight for maximum drama than it is to tell a story about forging a coalition government that involves tens of thousands of inhabited planets and inevitable moral compromise. The scenes from the “Star Wars” prequels set in the Galactic Senate didn’t exactly pop, and I can understand why subsequent directors and Kathleen Kennedy, who runs the “Star Wars” franchise, might not be eager to return to the narrative muck of governance. But it’s odd and annoying for the “Star Wars” movies to contort themselves and repeat old story dynamics to hold onto those dramatic balances even when it might make more sense to try something new. “The Force Awakens,” last year’s “Star Wars” movie, was set decades after “Return of the Jedi” and based on the premise that the Rebellion has established a government and was fighting a   remnant of the Empire, the First Order. Puzzlingly, New Republic apparently spun off an entire new movement, the Resistance, led by   Leia, to fight the First Order, rather than sending out its own army to do so. There is plenty of story potential in holding a movement together and the moments when it strains or fractures; if “Star Wars” had to have Leia leading up a rebellious, marginal organization, why not suggest that she has quit the New Republic over some sort of irreconcilable political difference? Of course, that would require more careful thinking about the New Republic’s politics in the first place. There are hints of tensions over tactics in “Rogue One,” which is set immediately before the events of “A New Hope. ” The movie introduces us to Saw Gerrera (Forest Whitaker) who was once a member of the Rebel Alliance but left when it decided his methods were too radical. His backstory  —   as is the case with much in “Rogue One”  —   is stated rather than shown or meaningfully explored. That’s a shame. Given attention and intelligence, Gerrera and his organization could have been the “Star Wars” universe’s version of Umkhonto we Sizwe, the military organization Nelson Mandela founded as an offshoot of the African National Congress to retaliate against the South African government. The Rebel Alliance would be a more interesting organization if it was developed enough so that we could see why anyone with the same goals might object to its strategy and if we saw its leaders grapple with people who had committed atrocities against the Empire. Instead, in “Rogue One,” we get the semblance of the Rebel Alliance deliberating over a plan to steal the Death Star schematics, only for that decision to be thrown out in favor of whatever leads to another round of air battles and frantic  . I like a good dogfight, but preserving this particular balance between the Dark side and the Light will have diminishing returns, just as surely as watching Marvel’s superheroes and villains turn cities to dust has gotten disturbingly wearying. And beyond the question of repetitive action beats, if the Rebel Alliance never gets the definitive upper hand on the Empire and settles down to become the New Republic, that stasis calls into question whether “Star Wars” is truly an epic. Remaining a perpetual underdog means that Leia never really gets tested as a peacetime leader and that we never really see whether the movement she’s a part of can maintain the moral superiority it gained in wartime once there’s peace, and Luke Skywalker never gets to figure out whether the Jedi Order can be resurrected and find a new role in society. These are critical questions that ought to be at the heart of the “Star Wars” story. And if this conflict never moves toward a resolution, then “Star Wars” isn’t really chronicling an epoch so much as filing dispatches from a stalemate. The ultimate defeat of the Empire or the First Order as the governing power in the galaxy doesn’t mean that “Star Wars” will lose all possibility of great villains. Instead, the fracturing of a huge military and political bureaucracy would inevitably give rise to new, and potentially more interesting, ones whose plans for dominating the universe don’t always come back to the construction of massive, cylindrical   with design flaws. The pulp writers behind the “Star Wars” Expanded Universe, the   books, games and comics that sketched out what happened after “Return of the Jedi,” came up with plenty of possibilities for who might be the New Republic’s next bete noire. Michael Stackpole, who wrote the “Rogue Squadron” books, came up with my favorite: Ysanne Isard, a former lover of Emperor Palpatine’s who almost split the New Republic with a virus that targeted aliens, but not humans, and that could only be cured with a massively costly treatment. A story like that gets at all sorts of terrific questions, including how to hold a coalition government together, how to combat a   and what it might have been like to thrive as a woman in the overwhelmingly male Imperial power structure. After all, shouldn’t Tilda Swinton or some equally fabulous woman get to swirl in one of those magnificent   capes? In a similar way, getting beyond the same drama about Jedi Knights falling to the Dark side of the Force and, correspondingly, into Imperial service, would make it possible to tell new stories about the Force itself, one of George Lucas’s greatest fictional inventions.      Here’s the trailer for the   ”Star Wars: The Force Awakens,” directed by J. J. Abrams. (The Walt Disney Company, Lucasfilm)   The sight of Luke Skywalker standing on that island promontory at the end of “The Force Awakens” thrilled me, but there has to be more to the Jedi than dour meditations on the temptations of power. What might it be like if the Jedi Knights were restored and went into law enforcement and government again? How might society and religion change if the order reemerged? What happens to people like Leia, who as we know from “Return of the Jedi” has some nascent power in the Force but as of “The Force Awakens” has chosen not to develop those talents? Again: If you can move things around with your mind, influence other people’s thinking and fight off whole battalions of people aimed with standard weaponry, and the adherents of your movement are spending all their time in hiding, coming out only to conduct occasional duels, how grand is the struggle between the different interpretations of the Force anyway? Though Hollywood may be losing sight of this fact, the measure of an epic story isn’t how big your production is, how many CGI artists you hire or how many city blocks get destroyed. The real metrics here are big ideas and grand sweeps of time and change. And for the new “Star Wars” movies to be great rather than merely popular, they need to move on to the next phase of this titanic struggle."
142344,217789,Obama’s hypocrisy on intelligence briefings,Washington Post,Marc A. Thiessen,2016-12-19,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161220002023/https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/obamas-hypocrisy-on-intelligence-briefings/2016/12/19/8b1fbed0-c5f4-11e6-bf4b-2c064d32a4bf_story.html
"," Well, that takes chutzpah. President Obama is criticizing   Donald Trump for failing to attend what The Post calls “the most exclusive, and arguably most important, daily meeting in Washington”  —   the Presidential Daily Briefing (PDB)  —   warning his successor that without the daily intelligence brief, “you are flying blind. ” This coming from the same person who skipped more than half of his daily intelligence briefings in his first term. As I reported in this space in 2012, during his first 1, 225 days in office, Obama attended his daily meeting to discuss the PDB just 536 times  —   an attendance record of 43. 8 percent. In 2011 and the first half of 2012, his attendance dropped even lower, to just over 38 percent of the time.  Talk about flying blind. Derek Chollet, a former senior official in the Obama administration, accused Trump of “malpractice” for skipping the same intelligence briefing his former boss regularly skipped, declaring “I think it is totally irresponsible in a    world. ” Not only did Obama commit the same malpractice, Obama used the same excuses as Trump to justify it. For example, Trump’s advisers have argued that he gets briefed by many sources and meets regularly with his national security team, including retired Lt. Gen. Mike Flynn. That is precisely the same line of argument the Obama White House used in 2012, when   Security Council spokesman Tommy Vietor told me in an email “this focus on just the PDB and not the countless other NSC meetings the President has each week really misses the point. For example, the President had a briefing with the Principals Committee to review   threats and mitigation efforts on September 10th. Seems like a relevant data point for your piece. ” So Obama could rely on other national security briefings, but Trump cannot? Trump’s critics have also mocked him for saying that he did not need to attend daily intelligence briefings because “I’m, like, a smart person. ” As Obama put it this month, “It’s a big, complicated world. It doesn’t matter how smart you are. ” But back in 2012, his NSC spokesman told me that Obama could forgo his daily intelligence meetings, and simply read written reports, because he was “among the most sophisticated consumers of intelligence on the planet. ” (Translation: He’s, like, a smart person). Indeed, skipping the in person briefing was a point of pride for the Obama White House. “Unlike your former boss [George W. Bush],” Vietor wrote, Obama “has it delivered to his residence in the morning and not briefed to him. ”  Obama was so smart, he did not need briefers. Both Obama and Trump are wrong. They do need briefers. And the intelligence community needs direct interaction with the president as much as the president needs direct interaction with the intelligence community. As I explained in 2012, “According to former officials who have detailed knowledge of the PDB process, having the daily meeting  —   and not just reading the briefing book  —   is enormously important both for the president and those who prepare the brief. For the president, the meeting is an opportunity to ask questions of the briefers, probe assumptions and request additional information. For those preparing the brief, meeting with the president on a daily basis gives them vital, direct feedback from the commander in chief about what is on his mind, how they can be more responsive to his needs, and what information he may have to feed back into the intelligence process. This process cannot be replicated on paper. ” Trump told  Chris Wallace he skipped the briefing because “I don’t have to be told the same thing in the same words every single day for the next eight years. ” If he meets with his intelligence briefers every day, he won’t get told the same thing, in the same words, every single day  —   because his briefers will tailor the PDB to fit his needs. Former CIA director Michael Hayden recalled  that with Bush “there was rich give and take, so that not only did the president get the advantage of knowing the analysts’ innermost thoughts, but [the analysts] also were able to leave the room understanding what the president believed he needed in order to make the kind of decisions he had to make. ” Under Obama, the intelligence community had to settle for reduced access. And the results are there for all to see. In his second term, Obama continued to miss the majority of his daily intelligence meetings  —   posting a 41. 26 percent attendance record through Sept. 29, 2014. If Obama had spent an hour a day with his intelligence briefers, perhaps he would not have dismissed the Islamic State as the “JV squad” in January 2014 and mistakenly declared that they were not “a direct threat to us or something that we have to wade into. ” Since then, the Islamic State has spread from Iraq and Syria to Libya, Yemen, Saudi Arabia, Tunisia, Algeria, Turkey, Egypt, Pakistan, Nigeria and Afghanistan. Yes, intelligence briefings matter. Trump seemed to agree in 2012, when he tweeted out my Post column on Obama’s dismal PDB attendance record, declaring “Priorities  —   while fundraising and campaigning on our dime, Obama has skipped over 50% of his intel briefings. ” Now, Trump is attending the briefing with even less frequency than Obama.  Of course, Trump is not yet commander in chief. Perhaps he will take the PDB more seriously once he comes face to face with the awesome responsibilities of keeping the country safe. In his Fox interview, he suggested that might be the case. Let’s hope so.    Read more from Marc Thiessen’s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook.                 "

","         As they fanned out across the Sunday shows,   Donald Trump’s closest aides and a number of GOP spinners evidenced a frightful willingness to deny the existence of a cyberattack on American sovereignty and democracy because it might make Trump feel less like a winner. Consider this exchange with Reince Priebus: WALLACE:    Trump told me last weekend that the CIA conclusion that Russia interfered with the election to help him was, quote, “ridiculous,” and it could have been some guy in a basement.  Well, now the CIA director, John Brennan, says he’s met with the director of national intelligence and the head of the FBI and, quote, “There’s strong consensus among us on the scope, nature, and intent of Russian interference. ” Question, does the   accept the consensus of the intel community? PRIEBUS:  Well, I think a lot of these things, though, Chris, are coming through third parties.  I mean, we haven’t heard from Comey.  When Clapper  —   WALLACE:  This was CIA Director Brennan.  You think he’s lying about what Jim Comey thinks? PRIEBUS:  No, I don’t think he is, but it sure would be nice to hear from everybody.  I mean, if there is this conclusive opinion among all of these intelligence agencies, then they should issue a report or they should stand in front of a camera and make the case. But that all being said, let’s put that aside for a second.  I think the real question is, why the Democrats and why these electors and why MoveOn. org and all of these organizations are doing everything they can to delegitimize the outcome of the election? I mean, they started out with a recount in states that they didn’t move the dial anywhere.  In fact,   Trump received more votes after that was done.  Then they went after this Diebold fiasco, which was proven to be totally untrue.  Now, they’re demanding  —   (CROSSTALK) PRIEBUS:  Right.  Now, they’re going forward tomorrow with this attempt to intimidate and harass electors.  I mean, we’ve got electors that are receiving 200, 000  .  Nothing is going to change. WALLACE:  But, Reince, I’m going to get to that on the electors.  I’m asking you a simple question.  Does the   accept the consensus  —   and that’s what John Brennan said it was  —   the consensus of the intel community about Russian interference and its intent? PRIEBUS:  I think he would accept the conclusion if these intelligence professionals would get together, put out a report, show the American people that they’re actually on the same page as opposed to third parties through The Washington Post. WALLACE:  This wasn’t a third party. PRIEBUS:  Right.  But we haven’t heard  —   WALLACE:  John Brennan issued a statement. PRIEBUS:  I mean, we haven’t heard from Comey.  I mean, we  —   so, look, I think that these guys should be straight with the American people and come out and say it.  I don’t think they’ve been clear about it.  I think that it’s been all over the map. WALLACE:  So, John Brennan, his statement is not enough for you? PRIEBUS:  Not when you have multiple people saying different things, coming through third parties and media reports. In other words, the Trump camp insists we must believe  —   contrary to the overwhelming mound of evidence from all intelligence entities  —   that Russian responsibility is unproved, for to do otherwise would make Trump’s win seem less convincing. And if U. S. national security interests are harmed, well, that’s a small price to pay for supporting the frail ego of a narcissist. On “Face the Nation,” Kellyanne Conway similarly went around and around with John Dickerson, dubbing this all a plot to get the “the Russian hacking issue to change the election result. ” In her best imitation of a Cold War Soviet propagandist, she refused to accept proof that didn’t mesh with the accepted political talking points: JOHN DICKERSON:  Kellyanne, sorry to interrupt. But just on this question of  —   Mr. Trump is still skeptical that the Russians were even involved. Leaving aside the question of whether it affected the election or not, you have the CIA, the FBI, the Director of National Intelligence, now a number of Republicans saying it’s clear that the Russians hacked  —   that, just as a basic premise is clear. Mr. Trump since late September has said that he doesn’t think that’s the case. He still says that now. What does he know that all those intelligence officers don’t know? KELLYANNE CONWAY:  John, where is the evidence? Why, when CIA officials were invited to a House intelligence briefing last week did they refuse to go? Instead, they’re talking to the media. That undermines our national security, our intelligence operations. Why are they doing that —   JOHN DICKERSON:  But does he himself have evidence, Kellyanne, that suggests that this isn’t the case? And on and on it went. The impression that the GOP has lost its collective wits and foreign policy credibility hardened as hyperpartisan Republican guests on the shows (who supported every   conspiracy theory Trump advanced in the campaign) parroted the willful denial routine and pretended this is simply a Democratic scheme to make Trump’s victory seem less legitimate. These same people for eight years have accused President Obama of not defending America when he voiced viewpoints favored by, for example, the Iranians. Their concern for national security now takes a back seat to partisan hackery. Republicans would be wise to follow the recommendation of Sens. Chuck Schumer ( . Y.) John McCain ( .) Lindsey Graham ( . C.) and Jack Reed ( . I.) to form a select committee. They want it to investigate the Russian hacking and also to help formulate a strategy to counter cyberattacks from Russia and other powers. Opposition to such an idea is inexplicable and unwise, suggesting that the GOP and incoming administration do not want to pursue a credible, bipartisan investigation. Are they so afraid of what it might uncover? To be blunt, a legitimate question exists as to whose side Trump is on, at least for now. Rep. Adam Schiff ( .) cautioned that “if he can’t be believed because he’s sending out false Tweets or he’s persuaded the American people not to believe what our own intelligence agencies or he’s given the Russians such deniability that they can come back and say are these the same intelligence agencies that the   told us not believe, he is damaging himself and our national security. ” Trump’s   spin may vanish once the electors meet and his paranoia about losing the presidency is squelched. (His willingness to act contrary to our country’s best interest still would be horrifying, but at least the mental gymnastics would end, we hope, before taking office.) Alternatively, Trump’s insistence on channeling Putin’s propaganda may reflect a more permanent and creepier mindset that refuses to see Russia as a foe of the West. If the latter, how far will this go  —   blocking sanctions? Acceding to Russian aggression? The suspicion that Trump is Putin’s lapdog has cast a shadow over his secretary of state nominee, who is distinguished only by his chumminess with Putin. We do not know if Trump has been bamboozled by   aides or has   reasons for excessive sympathy toward Russia. Either way, his inability to distinguish friend from foe  —   and his own interests from those of the country’s  —   should deeply concern all Americans. Republicans who are enabling Trump’s delusions do themselves and the country a great disservice. They need to think long and hard about giving Putin political cover to attack Western democracies. Let’s hope that, with the electoral college’s vote in the rearview mirror, Trump  —   and his Republican flacks  —   starts putting America, not Putin, first."
142346,217791,Obama adds to historic number of federal prisoners granted clemency,Washington Post,Sari Horwitz,2016-12-19,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161220002023/https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/obama-adds-to-historic-number-of-federal-prisoners-granted-clemency/2016/12/19/71dd9b64-c620-11e6-85b5-76616a33048d_story.html
"," President Obama pardoned 78 people and also granted commutations to 153 nonviolent drug offenders who were sentenced under harsh and outdated laws and would have received lighter sentences if convicted today. In total, Obama has pardoned 148 people and granted 1, 176 commutations for federal inmates under the clemency initiative that he and former attorney general Eric H. Holder Jr. launched two years ago. Obama plans to issue more commutations before he leaves office, White House Counsel W. Neil Eggleston said.  One of the men who received clemency is Corey Jacobs, 47, a Bronx native who was serving a life sentence for his first felony conviction on a drug charge. “I am elated at the news about my client, Corey Jacobs, receiving clemency from President Obama today,” Jacobs’s attorney, Brittany K. Byrd, said Monday. “Corey has more than paid his debt to society by serving over 17 years of a    sentence as a nonviolent drug offender. Life in prison without the possibility of parole screams that a person is beyond hope, beyond redemption. And in Corey’s case, it is a punishment that absolutely did not fit the crime. The president’s mercy and belief in redemption literally saved Corey’s life. ”      (Nicki DeMarco, Nikki Kahn and Sari   Washington Post)   Judge Henry Coke Morgan Jr. wrote a letter supporting Jacobs’s petition for clemency and said that he would not have imposed a life sentence had he not been required by law to do so. “Sadly, Mr. Jacobs is no anomaly,” Holder wrote last summer in an opinion piece in the New York Times. “There are thousands like him serving sentences in our federal and state systems that are disproportionate to their crimes. The financial cost of our current incarceration policy is straining government budgets; the human and community costs are incalculable. ” One of those inmates still waiting for clemency is    Bruce Harrison, a decorated Vietnam War veteran suffering from health problems who has served 23 years of a   sentence for his role in transporting drugs in a government sting operation. After Harrison and others were sentenced, several jurors said they were dismayed to learn how long those convicted were to spend behind bars. “If I would have been given the right to not only judge the facts in this case, but also the law and the actions taken by the government, the prosecutor, local and federal law enforcement officers connected in this case would be in jail and not the defendants,” juror Patrick L. McNeil wrote afterward. Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates said that the Justice Department will review all clemency petitions submitted by August and send its recommendations to Obama. “Our work is ongoing, and we look forward to additional announcements from the president before the end of his term,” Yates said. Julie Stewart, president of the group Families Against Mandatory Minimums, praised Obama’s additional clemencies, but she said that “commuting sentences isn’t going to dig us out of the   problem of   people in the first place. ” “That requires congressional action. And who knows what will happen in the new Congress,” Stewart said.     "
142347,217792,North Carolina governor-elect says lawmakers will call session to repeal bathroom bill,Washington Post,Mark Berman,2016-12-19,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161220002023/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2016/12/19/north-carolina-governor-elect-says-lawmakers-will-call-session-to-repeal-bathroom-bill/
","     The city of Charlotte on Monday abandoned a nondiscrimination ordinance that helped spark North Carolina’s “bathroom bill,” clearing the way for legislators to potentially drop the highly criticized measure that prompted lawsuits and cost the state jobs and tourism dollars. North Carolina’s   Roy Cooper, said Monday he has been told that due to Charlotte’s actions, state lawmakers would call a special session Tuesday to vote on repealing the measure known as House Bill 2 (or “H. B. 2″). This bill is   for its provisions restricting which restrooms transgender people can use, but it also reversed local ordinances expanding protections for LGBT people and limited some   standards. When the Justice Department and North Carolina filed dueling lawsuits over the bill earlier this year, U. S. Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch said the fight was “about a great deal more than just bathrooms. ” North Carolina lawmakers who backed the bill said it was needed to combat “government overreach” in Charlotte and protect women, and they continued making such comments on Monday. Opponents said H. B. 2 amounted to   discrimination, and it was criticized by a host of business groups as well as civil rights organizations.  Cooper, the Democrat who this month was declared the winner in a close race with incumbent Gov. Pat McCrory (R) said in a statement that the Republican legislative leadership had “assured me that as a result of Charlotte’s vote, a special session will be called for Tuesday to repeal [H. B. 2] in full. ” The head of the Human Rights Campaign said Cooper told them he had worked out a deal with state lawmakers to scrap the bathroom bill. A spokesman for Cooper did not respond to messages seeking comment Monday.   My statement on today’s Charlotte City Council vote: pic. twitter.   —   Roy Cooper (@RoyCooperNC) December 19, 2016   The top Republicans in the North Carolina legislature  —   Sen. Phil Berger, the president pro tempore of the state Senate, and Rep. Tim Moore, speaker of the House  —   sharply denounced Charlotte Mayor Jennifer Roberts and Cooper on Monday. They had particularly harsh words for Cooper, calling him “dishonest and disingenuous” in attempting “to take credit” for a possible vote on repealing the measure. “Today Roy Cooper and Jennifer Roberts proved what we said was the case all along: their efforts to force men into women’s bathrooms and shower facilities was a political stunt to drive    money into the governor’s race,” Berger and Moore said in a joint statement. “For months, we’ve said if Charlotte would repeal its bathroom ordinance that created the problem, we would take up the repeal” of H. B. 2, they continued. “Roy Cooper is not telling the truth about the legislature committing to call itself into session  —   we’ve always said that was Gov. McCrory’s decision, and if he calls us back, we will be prepared to act. ” McCrory agreed after Charlotte’s vote to call a special session, but he also criticized the city’s sudden decision and echoed Berger and Moore in arguing that Democrats had been using the issue for political gain. “Governor McCrory has always publicly advocated a repeal of the overreaching Charlotte ordinance,” Graham Wilson, a spokesman, said in a statement. “But those efforts were always blocked by Jennifer Roberts, Roy Cooper and other Democratic activists. This sudden reversal with little notice after the gubernatorial election sadly proves this entire issue originated by the political left was all about politics and winning the governor’s race at the expense of Charlotte and our entire state. ” Rep. Larry Hall, the House Democratic leader, said he thinks political opposition to the bathroom bill has reached critical mass and could spur a vote to repeal it. Even though North Carolina Republicans kept their supermajorities in the legislature, Democrats managed to knock off four state House Republicans in districts a federal court ruled were unconstitutionally gerrymandered. “A lot of the damage has been done,” Hall said, referencing companies that opted to scrap plans to expand in the state. “We’ll never get those jobs back and those opportunities back. At least it stops the bleeding if we do this now, so that we can be competitive again. ” State lawmakers hastily passed H. B. 2 in March, quickly following Charlotte passing its own ordinance a month earlier. The measure prompted intense anger and opposition, and businesses including PayPal and Deutsche Bank abandoned plans to expand into the state with hundreds of jobs. Musicians including Bruce Springsteen canceled concerts, while the NBA and NCAA relocated games scheduled to be played in the state. Investors spoke out against the law, which tourism groups said was costing the state significant amounts of money. One estimate, published by Forbes, said the state lost more than $600 million in business due to the bill. It was not immediately clear what impact the movement would have on the ongoing legal fights over the bill, although presumably a repeal would end those lawsuits. The Justice Department declined to comment about whether it would abandon its lawsuit if the bill is repealed. The American Civil Liberties Union, another group challenging the measure in federal court, said it would only know what will happen to its lawsuit once the legislature repeals H. B. 2.  In a statement Monday, the city of Charlotte said its council “recognizes the ongoing negative economic impact resulting from the passage of the city’s nondiscrimination ordinance and the state’s House Bill 2. ” City officials left no doubt they were acting specifically to prompt state lawmakers to act on H. B. 2. The Charlotte City Council voted Monday morning to remove its nondiscrimination ordinance from the city code, and in its statement, Charlotte “urges the state to follow immediately with a repeal of House Bill 2. ” The council’s voted   to pass the resolution repealing the ordinance, with one member absent, a city spokeswoman said. However, the repeal resolution includes language stating that it will become invalid if H. B. 2 is not “repealed in its entirety by December 31, 2016. ” Charlotte Mayor Jennifer Roberts, who has previously said the city would not repeal the ordinance, did not immediately respond to a request for comment Monday.  “  Cooper has briefed us on a deal he brokered with state lawmakers to reach a complete and total repeal” of H. B. 2, Chad Griffin, president of the Human Rights Campaign, said in a statement. H. B. 2 “is precisely why North Carolinians went to the polls and ousted Governor McCrory last month. It’s time to chart a new course guided by the state’s values of dignity and respect, not discrimination and hate  —   and to ensure nondiscrimination protections exist in cities, towns and across the state of North Carolina. ” While the ACLU of North Carolina is “encouraged” that H. B. 2 could be repealed, “it never should have come at the cost of protections for LGBT people living in Charlotte,” said Sarah Gillooly, policy director for the group. Mara Keisling, executive director of the National Center for Transgender Equality, echoed that, calling it disappointing “that Charlotte’s commonsense ordinance was repealed in order to get the General Assembly to even consider a full repeal” of H. B. 2. “Completely repealing [H. B. 2] is only the first step lawmakers must take to repair the harm they have done to their own constituents,” Keisling said in a statement. “Even after it is repealed, there will be a long way to go. ”      North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory (R) defended the state’s controversial bathroom law on May 9, asking Congress to weigh in. (Reuters)   As attorney general, Cooper was a vocal opponent of H. B. 2 and refused to defend it. The possible movement on H. B. 2 comes as Cooper and Republican lawmakers are facing off in a bitter,     fight over how much power he will actually get to exert when he takes the governor’s mansion. Republicans in the state have introduced and quickly passed bills that would limit his power, including curtailing his influence in the courts and requiring state Senate approval for Cabinet picks. Cooper has blasted these moves as “unprecedented” and “ominous,” while his opponents have argued they are putting in place needed reforms meant to let them enact checks and balances. The   has threatened legal action, vowing: “They will see me in court. ” Amber Phillips contributed to this report.

"," The House Select Committee on Benghazi has settled a lawsuit brought by a former staffer who alleged that he was fired in part because he was unwilling to focus solely on the State Department and Hillary Clinton in order to understand the attacks, attorneys for the staffer said. The settlement ends a messy dispute that raised questions about whether the committee  —   formed to investigate the 2012 attacks that killed four Americans at U. S. facilities in Benghazi, Libya  —   was trying to achieve partisan goals. The staffer, Bradley Podliska, alleged in court papers that he was fired “because he was unwilling to go along with the   on the State Department and Secretary Clinton based upon the fact that his comprehensive, thorough, and objective investigation was pointing at other agencies and individuals and not solely the State Department and Secretary Clinton. ” He also alleged that supervisors retaliated against him because he had to take two leaves to fulfill his obligations as an Air Force reservist.  In a statement provided by his lawyer, Podliska said, “I am happy to move beyond this dispute, and I will continue to serve my country and do whatever I can do to advance the security and interests of our nation. ” His lawyer, Peter   declined to provide the terms of the settlement, saying the agreement was secret. Spokesmen for the committee and its chairman, Rep. Trey Gowdy ( . C.) did not immediately return messages seeking comment. The Benghazi committee has long faced criticism that its work turned into an effort to undermine Clinton’s bid to become president. At one point, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy ( .) suggested that the investigation had helped spur a drop in Clinton’s poll numbers. Democrats also charged that the effort, which cost $7 million and took two years, was a waste of time and money. The final report by the Republican majority found serious flaws in the U. S. response to the attack but produced no new revelations of specific wrongdoing by Clinton. It was against that politicized backdrop that Podliska first made his allegations in 2015. He said that when he came back from a military leave, his supervisors were hostile toward him. According to his lawsuit, a supervisor saw Facebook pictures Podliska had posted while in Germany in May 2015 and believed  —   wrongly, in Podliska’s estimation  —   that the reservist was abusing his leave. But Podliska also alleged, both in his lawsuit and publicly, that he was fired because he resisted demands to focus his efforts on Clinton and the State Department. Gowdy at the time denied Podliska’s allegations. “What the record makes clear is he himself was focused on Clinton improperly and was instructed to stop, and that issues with his conduct were noted on the record as far back as April,” Gowdy told The Washington Post in October 2015. The committee, in responding to Podliska’s lawsuit, said his termination was for other reasons than those he claimed. “This decision was a result of Plaintiff’s repeated lapses in judgment, including Plaintiff’s unwillingness to perform  —   or inability to understand  —   the Committee’s investigation, his apparent inability to handle potentially classified information properly, and other professional deficiencies,” lawyers for the committee wrote. Podliska continues to serve in the Air Force Reserve as a major, his lawyer said.     "

","     In March 2016, Sherry Spencer opened the doors to her passion project, a   cherry red building that peeks over historic downtown Whitefish, one of Montana s quaint, upscale ski resort towns. The building, 22 Lupfer, houses luxury vacation apartments and commercial office space, an embodiment of the two community strongholds  ”Â tourism and small business  ”Â that keep Whitefish on the map. But in recent weeks, the building has become the focal point of another,   slice of the town s reputation  ” one that was recently thrust into the national spotlight with the victory of   Donald Trump and the rise in popularity of Whitefish s most notorious   resident, Â Richard Spencer, theÂ white nationalist founder of the   movement who also happens to be Sherry Spencer s son.  Her business hadÂ once been affiliated with her son, according to building documents, and her home address is still listed as the location of the National Policy Institute s principal office, Virginia state records show. By late November, Sherry SpencerÂ still had not, activists said in local news reports, publicly disavowed her son s beliefs. As a community business owner and longtime Whitefish resident, some believed she should. The town and Richard Spencer had tussled before, on the ski slopes and in a coffee shop, but his mother, Sherry Spencer, and his father, Rand, hadÂ kept a remarkably low profile. Rand is an ophthalmologist. SherryÂ owns the business. At the time 22 Lupfer opened, Sherry Spencer s efforts were lauded by the local newspaper. But that was nine months ago, before Richard Spencer s   movement claimed Donald Trump as its champion and before Trump s election pushed that movement into the national spotlight. It was before hate incidents targeting Muslims and people of color spiked in the days after Trump s victory and before Richard SpencerÂ inspired a    Hail Trump! ? salute at a D. C. conference hosted by hisÂ white nationalistÂ think tank, the National Policy Institute.  It was before Whitefish once again felt the need to defend its reputation from the smear of Richard Spencer s philosophy. The town held a vigil and the mayor reread the town s   resolution at a December city council meeting, a resolution passed in 2014 when Richard Spencer s movement first reared its head in Whitefish. But that didn t seem like enough. Some residents directed their attention to Sherry Spencer. The escalating tension was chronicled in aÂ local TV reportÂ last week that seemed to tell the simple tale of a small town deeply divided. The specifics of what happened next  ”Â who approached whom, who initiated what  ”Â remain unclear. Sherry Spencer claims she was targeted by activists, who, using the threat of massive protests as leverage, tried to bully her and her tenants into selling her commercial building and distancing herself from her son. Those same activists tell a different story  ” that what transpired was the work of a tightknit community trying to defend itself. What is clear, though, is that the local TV story thrust all their names into the national spotlight. And it didn t take long for the followers of Richard Spencer s movement, including former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke, to join the conversation.      The alternative right has come under fire from Hillary Clinton and establishment Republicans, but it has been seeping into American politics for years as a   option for conservatives. Here’s what you need to know about the   movement. (Jenny   Washington Post)   Within days, aÂ handful of white nationalist,   websites took to the Internet to defend Spencer sÂ mother and vilify the activists listed in the local TV story, including the founders of Love Lives Here, an affiliate of the Montana Human Rights Network, a rabbi and several Jewish community leaders. The most prominent among them was the Daily Stormer, a   website that promotes a  Jewish Problem ? tab and once published an article after the election thatÂ called on readers to  troll ?

Daily Stormer shared the names of the Whitefish activists, who are all women, and their photos, which were accompanied by sexist commentary and digitally altered with overlays of the Star of David. The post included the women s phone numbers, Twitter handles and email addresses, plus the names and contact information for their husbands. The post also shared the name, photo and Twitter account of one woman s young son. It encouraged readers to spam Love Lives Here and the Montana Human Rights Network.  So  ”Â get to it! ? the post says, reminding readers not to advocate or provoke violence.  Let these people know what you think! ?  All weekend, the human rights organizations and about a   people, including all three women, have been receiving death threats.  Go choke on a shotgun and die, ? read one message.  You would all be of greater worth to society as human fertilizer than as citizens. ? City council members have been targeted, and local businesses that support human rights are being harassed on review forums.  It s exactly what they called for, ? Rachel Carroll Rivas,   of the Montana Human Right Network, told The Washington Post early Monday.  They called for an online troll storm and that s what it is. It is very personal and incredibly  . These are tactics that are intended to instill fear. ? Rivas said those receiving the   threats are reporting them to law enforcement as they flood in. Two of the Jewish women whose identities were published asked Rivas to speak on their behalf. They are trying to lay low and wait for the harassment to subside, Rivas said. She praised the efforts of the activists who are being targeted and said that the Human Rights Network will continue to support the work of Love Lives Here.      No, they aren’t just pranksters and they aren’t an extension of European nationalism. Reporter and author Olivia Nuzzi tackles five myths about the  . (Adriana   Washington Post)   With all the media coverage of the threats, Rivas told The Post she is worried that an important element of the evolving story has been left out of the conversation.  I think the statement that the Spencers made about Richard s ideas is a very important part of this that has gotten lost, ? Rivas said. In multiple ways, across several platforms, Sherry and Rand Spencer have publicly distanced themselves from their son s white nationalist philosophy. In the local TV story, Sherry Spencer said that as parents, she and Rand  deeply love our son, as we always will, ? but, she added  we unequivocally do not agree with the extreme positions espoused by Richard. ?  She reiterated in aÂ Medium postÂ on Dec. 16 that she is the sole owner of the 22 Lupfer building in downtown Whitefish and wrote that  she poured her heart and soul into this project. ? Sherry Spencer criticized the pressure she received from community members and directed her frustration toward one woman, a local   agent, who was also a target of the Daily Stormer post. Richard does not own the building, nor has he ever used it for his writing or publishing. Put simply, the building has nothing to do with politics Š ” Šand it has everything to do with tourism and local businesses. I had no intention of sellingÂ .Â .Â . until I started receiving terrible threats in the last couple of weeks.  Sherry Spencer never intended to  go public ? with the story, she wrote, but the media coverage  forces my hand. ? She continued: Whatever you think about my son s ideas Š ” Šthey are, after all, ideas Š ” Šin what moral universe is it right for the  sins ? of the son to be visited upon the mother? All I wanted to do with the building was help Whitefish. The people attacking me claim that  loves lives here. ? Now it s time for them to show it. The following day, Sherry Spencer updated the Medium post with a disclaimer asking readers to stay  within the bounds of respectful, civilized discussion of this matter by refraining from abusive comments or targeted harassment of any of the parties involved, or their families. ? She added that she disavowed the harassment some were already facing.  In an interview Sunday night with The Post, her son, Richard Spencer, did not disavow the call to action from the Daily Stormer, but did say  that s not really my style. ?  I would not have posted someone s personal information, it s not the way I do things, ? Spencer said.  I think it s important to call people out. ? Richard Spencer, who was in Whitefish for the holidays when he talked to The Post, was also highly critical of the group Love Lives Here.  Their lives are based around creating tension and hating people, ? he told The Post.  No one in Whitefish had anything ill to say about my mother. ? He said he was  shocked ? by the behavior of some residents, that the last name of one Jewish activist sounded  sinister ? and that the rabbi was  up to no good. ? Richard Spencer called the attacks on his mother  vicious ? and  totally unwarranted. ?  She s not a political person, ? Spencer said. Â  I m sure it s been terrible to be attacked by these people, she is not political, she is not an activist, she is not an ideologue. Â These people are trying to vicariously attack me through her. ? Spencer told The Post his mother has not yet decided if she ll sell the building, but in an email to theÂ Daily Inter Lake a few days ago, Rand Spencer said that as a result of the threats, Sherry had decided to sell the building.  That same day, the Daily Inter Lake published an   from Rand and Sherry Spencer titled  An appeal to Whitefish: Live and let live. ? In it, the Spencers explained why they love the town and decided to settle there, then claimed Richard Spencer as their son. We are the parents of Richard Spencer, president of the National Policy Institute and a leader in the   movement. As parents we love our son. We are not accustomed to the spotlight. Furthermore, we feel we are not part of the story, nor do we wish to be a part of this story, as our son is a grown man. We are not racists. We have never been racists. We do not endorse the idea of white nationalism. As Richard reported to the Dallas Morning News,  Their [my parents] political views are not mine. ? Further quoting Richard,  You would ve never guessed that I would become a political radical. When I was a kid in Dallas  ” even a young man in Dallas  ” I was not a political radical. I don t think there was anything in my childhood that inspired me to go down this path. If anything, I went down this path in spite of my background. They called themselves and their business tenants  victims ? for being threatened with boycotts. There is no justification for their sustaining collateral damage. We, too, are victims, having no role in any of the events that have unfolded recently. A wise friend recently consoled us that being a parent, especially of an adult, is one of accepting responsibility without having control. The Spencers finished their   with a simple plea: We love Whitefish and the Flathead area. We have made many dear friends during the last 12 years. It is our desire and intent to be a valuable and contributing part of the community. We hope we can continue to have a place here among you in the future.

142351,217796,IMF chief Christine Lagarde found guilty for past payout to French tycoon,Washington Post,Ana Swanson,2016-12-19,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161220002023/https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/imf-chief-christine-lagarde-found-guilty-for-past-payout-to-french-tycoon/2016/12/19/070e0256-c611-11e6-8bee-54e800ef2a63_story.html
"," International Monetary Fund chief Christine Lagarde was found guilty Monday of criminal negligence for a government payout to a business tycoon eight years ago while she served as France’s finance minister, but the IMF said she will remain as the fund’s managing director. The French court chose not to sentence Lagarde to a fine or jail time. Yet the charge of negligence threatens to cloud the reputation of the IMF and its managing director as its mission of global economic integration comes under fire from populist governments around the world.  In a statement Monday, Lagarde said she was not satisfied with the court’s decision but had chosen not to appeal.  “I have been held negligent, but without penalty, without sanction, without registration of the decision. I’m not satisfied with it, but there’s a point in time when one has to just stop, turn the page, and move on,” she said at a news conference. “So I’m very happy to not appeal this decision, and to focus all my attention, all my time, all my efforts, to my mission as head of the IMF. ”   In a statement issued later Monday, the IMF’s executive board reiterated its support for Lagarde’s leadership and her “ability to continue to effectively carry out her duties. ”  “The Executive Board looks forward to continuing to work with the Managing Director to address the difficult challenges facing the global economy,” the statement said.  The trial centered on an arbitration case that has been a fixture of French politics for more than a decade. Critics say Lagarde failed to adequately vet a massive government payout to French businessman Bernard Tapie in 2008, during Lagarde’s tenure as France’s finance minister under   Nicolas Sarkozy.  Tapie, once the major shareholder in the   company Adidas, sold the company in 1993 to avoid conflicts of interest before taking a position in the cabinet of France’s   François Mitterrand, a Socialist. But the following year, Tapie alleged that Credit Lyonnais, the partially   bank that had overseen the transaction, deliberately devalued his company and defrauded him of millions. Tapie sold Adidas for 315 million euros; it was resold the next year for more than double that price.  As French finance minister, Lagarde referred the case to a private arbitration panel that ultimately awarded Tapie a payout of 404 million euros ($421 million). The settlement outraged some, who argued that the bank, then owned by the state, was vulnerable to political favoritism.   A French court has since ruled that Tapie was not entitled to the compensation, and Lagarde was subsequently accused of “negligence with public money. ” Lagarde, 60, had faced up to a year in prison and a fine of 15, 000 euros. But one of the presiding judges said Monday that the defendant would face neither and would not have a criminal record. Legal experts and IMF analysts said that Lagarde had been transparent about the allegations she faced from the beginning of her leadership at the fund.  “Now, she has a gray mark on her record, and for those people who do not like her, that may be brought up,” said Edwin Truman, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. “But I think she’s very respected. ”  In her more than five years at the IMF, Lagarde has led the fund in recognizing the challenge of growing global inequality, changing members’ voting shares to help account for the growth of emerging nations such as China and persuading countries to provide backup financing for the fund, Truman said. As the first female head of the IMF, she also gained recognition as a role model.   Lagarde ran practically unopposed in her reelection to a second   term as head of the fund in February, a sign of her relative popularity. Yet analysts said the IMF itself may not share Lagarde’s renown. The fund has long been a symbol of economic integration and the global elite, both of which have faced criticism with the election of nationalist and populist governments in recent years, including that of Donald Trump in the United States. Trump is expected to confront the question of whether to increase funding for the IMF, a decision that could financially paralyze the institution, Truman said. Since the financial crisis, the fund has also been associated with   initiatives that some argue have worsened recessions and unemployment in struggling economies such as Greece and Spain.  “Obviously this all doesn’t help the IMF, to have . . . people questioning that she was negligent,” said Desmond Lachman, a resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute. “But I don’t think that’s anywhere near the cause of popular resentment toward the IMF. The IMF is regarded very much as part of the political elite, the establishment. So if you’re at all unhappy in the way in which the economy is performing, the IMF is going to be among the first institutions to be blamed. ”  The charges against Lagarde are seen as particularly embarrassing for the IMF, given that her two predecessors both faced unrelated legal charges.  Dominique   IMF chief from 2007 to 2011, resigned after facing charges of sexually assaulting a hotel maid. The charges were later dropped.  Rodrigo Rato, the IMF managing director from 2004 to 2007, was accused of misdealings after he left the fund. Rato is now on trial alongside 64 other bankers over the misuse of funds during his tenure at Bankia, a Spanish bank, from 2010 to 2012.  “To have yet another IMF managing director with legal issues is not good for the organization, but I would stress that hers seem to be of a totally different order,” Lachman said. Many in France ascribe political motivation to Lagarde’s trial. Some have described it as a way to attack the conservative Sarkozy, whom Lagarde served as finance chief and who was later supported by Tapie.  Others accused the court of being unnecessarily lenient on Lagarde.  The legal case “was also very much a political trial,” said Veronique de Rugy, a senior research fellow at George Mason University’s Mercatus Center.    "
142352,217797,Interior adopts controversial last-minute rule to make the coal industry cleaner,Washington Post,Darryl Fears,2016-12-19,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161220002023/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2016/12/19/interior-adopts-controversial-last-minute-rule-to-make-the-coal-industry-cleaner/
","     The Obama administration finalized a rule Monday morning that aims to protect thousands of miles of streams by forcing coal mining companies “to avoid mining practices that permanently pollute streams, destroy drinking water sources   …     and threaten forests,” officials said in a statement. Under the rule, which overhauls regulations in place for more than three decades, coal companies that have finished mining in an area will be required to restore the land to the same condition that existed before digging began. Interior Secretary Sally Jewell called the new regulations “a balanced approach to meeting the nation’s energy needs. ” In the statement, released before the rule was published in the Federal Register, she noted that the administration “worked closely with many stakeholders to craft a plan that protects water quality, supports economic opportunities, safeguards our environment and makes coalfield communities more resilient. ” But the announcement, coming a month before power is handed over to a new presidential administration, is almost certain to anger coal companies and conservative Republicans. The rule likely will be an early target of   Donald Trump, who pledged during his campaign to help turn around an industry beset by debt, job losses and declining profits  —   all of which make the cleanup requirements of a 1977 federal law more difficult.  The industry’s financial crisis has led to fears that the nation’s largest coal companies might leave taxpayers with hundreds of millions of dollars in cleanup costs for closed mines. Companies are currently obligated to rehabilitate hundreds of huge strip mines in the West and   sites in the East.    Interior Secretary Sally Jewell delivers a speech in Las Vegas. (Erik   Vegas   via AP)  Those worries spiked this year when Peabody Energy, the world’s largest publicly traded coal company, appealed to creditors for an extra month to pay its debts. Over six months ending in March, two more of the nation’s four biggest coal companies have declared bankruptcy. The National Mining Association quickly slammed the new rule, calling it a duplication of regulations that already exist under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977.  “This is after the agency failed in its obligation to engage mining states in the rule’s development and ended up with a massive rule making that is a win for bureaucracy and extreme environmental groups and a loss for everyday Americans,” said Hal Quinn, the group’s president and chief executive. He said the rule reflects “the environmental lobby’s keep it in the ground platform, locking away important U. S. domestic coal reserves, while putting tens of thousands of Americans out of work, raising energy costs for millions of Americans and preserving the agency’s regulatory mission that is diminished with the declining number of coal mines. ” Quinn did not mention the sharp drop in the price and use of coal as power plants switch to natural gas  —  a major reason why coal workers are being released and mines are being shut. The new rule is the sort of regulation that Trump has vowed to undo. In this case, he could issue a   order to temporarily delay the process it takes to implement it, and the   Congress could assist him by issuing a review order and overturning any rule adopted after midyear.  Some lawmakers are already complaining. “I continue to have real concerns about this administration’s     approach to the regulation of energy development and production, which doesn’t work for our state,” said Sen. Heidi Heitkamp ( . D.). Heitkamp said she had toured with a top Interior official who visited North Dakota to show her how the rule would hurt the industry and workers, but to no avail. “Going forward, I’ll work with my colleagues in the [Senate] and the incoming administration to see if this rule is workable,” she said. Interior officials first announced their intent to draft new regulations in 2009. Officials said Monday that the result is guided by the best science and an understanding of improved technology used by coal companies. In the seven years it took to draft and finalize the rule, the department received more than 150, 000 comments and recorded statements from 15 public meetings and other gatherings. “This updated   …     rule will make life better for a countless number of Americans who live near places where coal is being mined,” said Joseph Pizarchik, director of the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement. Coal is mined throughout the United States, but the top producing states are Wyoming, West Virginia, Kentucky, Pennsylvania and Illinois, according to the U. S. Energy Information Administration. “We are closing loopholes and improving our rules to more completely implement the law passed by Congress,” Pizarchik said. Read More U.

142353,217798,"El Niño on a warming planet may have sparked the Zika epidemic, scientists report",Washington Post,Chelsea Harvey,2016-12-19,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161220002023/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2016/12/19/el-nino-on-a-warming-planet-may-have-sparked-the-zika-epidemic-scientists-report/
","     In a world characterized by rising temperatures, deforestation and other human influences on the environment, the spread of infectious disease is a hot topic. Many recent studies suggest that environmental changes can affect the transmission of everything from malaria to the Zika virus  —   and it’s increasingly important to understand these links, scientists say.   This week, a new study has provided new evidence that environmental changes can increase the threat of disease. It concludes that unusually warm temperatures caused by 2015’s severe El Niño event  —   probably compounded by ongoing climate change  —   may have aided in the rapid spread of the Zika virus in South America that year. And while there are many complex factors at play in the spread of   diseases, the study may help scientists better prepare for the kinds of future effects we might see in our warming world. “The start of the mission was simple  —   trying to address where the risk will be, where is it going to move next, where could Zika happen on the planet on a global scale,” said Cyril Caminade, a research fellow at the University of Liverpool and the new study’s lead author. To that end, the authors designed a study that would help them determine how climatic changes have impacted the   transmission of Zika.   There are two main species of mosquito known to carry the Zika virus  —   Aedes aegypti, or the yellow fever mosquito, which is widespread in the tropics; and Aedes albopictus, or the Asian tiger mosquito, which lives in both tropical and temperate regions of the world. Scientists also believe Zika can be sexually transmitted, but the new study focused only on mosquito transmission.   For the study, the researchers collected published information on the distribution of these two mosquito species and how temperature variations can affect them. Studies suggest, for instance, that up to a certain point, rising temperatures can cause mosquitoes to bite more frequently. The researchers also collected global historical climate data from the past few decades and used all the information to build a model of Zika transmission worldwide.   The model produced an unusually high disease transmission potential in the tropics for the year 2015, including in Colombia and Brazil, the countries hit hardest by Zika. Similar results occurred between 1997 and 1998, one of the only other times on record to experience such a brutal El Niño event. “[O]ur model indicates that the 2015 El Niño event, superimposed on the   global warming trend, has had an important amplification effect,” the researchers note in the paper.   The model also helped the researchers identify the ideal seasonal climate conditions for Zika transmission around the world. In South America, for instance, the model suggests that the potential for transmission should peak in the winter and spring.  In the southeastern U. S. on the other hand, summer is ideal. In fact, the model suggests this region has a high potential for disease transmission during this time, due partly to the high temperatures and partly to the fact that both mosquito species are found there.   That said, reports of Zika have been limited in the U. S. so far  —   and this speaks to the complexity of   disease transmission, Caminade said. Climate can certainly play a significant role in setting up the right conditions for an outbreak, but epidemics also depend on many other factors, including population density, access to healthcare and the use of pesticides and other   interventions in any given location. Some of these factors  —   which were not accounted for in the new study  —   can probably explain why there hasn’t been much Zika transmission in the U. S. so far. Caminade also pointed out that after a population has been exposed to a   disease like Zika, a phenomenon called “herd immunity” often occurs  —   this happens when so many people have already been exposed, and developed an immunity, that there aren’t enough new people left to infect to continue the epidemic. This is the probably part of the reason we didn’t see Zika epidemics in other tropical parts of the world in 2015, despite the new study’s results. And some experts have suggested that herd immunity will likely cause the current situation in South America to burn itself out within a few more years.   But Caminade cautions that there’s still the potential for Zika outbreaks in other parts of the world where the conditions are right, including the United States and even southern Europe. The result would likely be milder than what’s been experienced in South America in the past year, but there’s “still risk,” he said.   According to Caminade, one of the study’s major takeaway points is that extreme climate conditions can lead to all kinds of unusual events  —   droughts, floods and wildfires are only a few examples  —   and disease outbreak is just one more potential disaster scientists should be looking out for when these conditions occur.   And such events may only be exacerbated by future climate change. Some studies have suggested that the kinds of “monster” El Niño events seen in 1997 and 2015 may be more likely in a warmer world, Caminade pointed out. But he added that scientists wishing to make more precise predictions about the future spread of disease must take a wide variety of factors into account  —   climate is just one of them. “I won’t overplay the role of climate for the future,” he said. “It’s still a disease, and there are still parameters which are going to be very important. ”"
142354,217799,Pregnancy changes the brain for as long as two years,Washington Post,Amy Ellis Nutt,2016-12-19,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161220002023/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2016/12/19/pregnancy-changes-the-brain-for-as-long-as-two-years/
","     For the first time, scientists have found evidence of specific and   changes in the brains of pregnant women. The changes were measured in brain areas that are responsible for social cognition and the ability to understand the thoughts and intentions of others, suggesting that they may intensify maternal bonding with a newborn. The neuroimaging study, conducted in Spain, was prospective, looking at the brains of 25   mothers before and after pregnancy, and again two years after the women gave birth. The researchers compared the brain images of these new mothers to those of 19   fathers, as well as 17 men and 20 women without children. The pattern of structural changes the researchers observed in the new mothers were so distinct that it was possible to identify the mothers just from their brain scans. Those changes endured for at least two years, except for a partial return to its previous state in the hippocampus, a brain structure heavily involved with memory. The MRI study showed changes in gray matter, the outer layer of the brain that contains the cell bodies of neurons. The gray matter in certain areas shrunk in size after pregnancy, a phenomenon known as “gray matter pruning. ” A similar shrinkage is seen in early childhood and during adolescence. The gray matter contains many interconnections among neurons, and during pruning, the most important connections are strengthened and the others are left to wither. Rather than indicating a loss of ability, pruning is generally taken to mean that a brain region has become more specialized. The researchers also found that some women had more gray matter pruning than others, and those with the most pruning seemed to bond best with their babies. “The gray matter volume changes of pregnancy significantly predicted the quality of    attachment and the absence of hostility toward their newborns in the postpartum period,” the authors wrote in a study published Monday in Nature Neuroscience. In a further experiment, the researchers showed women pictures of several babies and found, unsurprisingly, that the women’s brains responded more strongly to photos of their own babies. The brain images, they said, revealed “the strongest neural activity in response to the women’s babies corresponded to regions that lost gray matter volume across pregnancy. ”  Pregnancy is associated with a surge of sex hormones akin to the heightened production of sex hormones during puberty. The researchers noted that gray matter also is pruned during adolescence, when a spectrum of emotional, cognitive and behavioral neural changes begin to fine tune the teenage brain. Cordelia Fine, a psychologist at the University of Melbourne who had no part in this research, said that “this is a solid study,” despite the small sample size. Fine has written several books about gender and how   differences are often overstated in science. “The authors are appropriately careful not to conclude that the brain changes they observe are caused by hormones (or by hormones alone) since they don’t show this directly. However, this is certainly a plausible hypothesis. ”  Fine cautions that the brain areas identified by the scientists are also responsible for other functions, not simply attachment. A more significant caveat, she said, is that while the authors of the study “speculate that the structural brain changes they see underlie maturation” of neural networks that “could facilitate attachment . . . it’s worth noting that the authors measured empathy before and after pregnancy, and found no change. ” According to the authors of the study, these brain changes may “serve an adaptive purpose for pending motherhood,” that is, the stronger the   attachment, the greater chance the child survives.

142355,217800,"Lou Harris, pollster for presidents and others officeholders, dies at 95",Washington Post,Zach C. Cohen,2016-12-19,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161220002023/https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/lou-harris-pollster-for-presidents-and-others-officeholders-dies-at-95/2016/12/19/e7f49c2a-c626-11e6-bf4b-2c064d32a4bf_story.html
"," Lou Harris, an influential pollster and political consultant who was among the first to provide polling services directly to candidates and officeholders and helped guide one client, a junior U. S. senator from Massachusetts named John F. Kennedy, to the White House, died Dec. 17 at his home in Key West, Fla. He was 95.  The cause was a heart ailment, said a son, Peter Harris, a retired pollster who worked with his father. Polling for much of its history was a public affair. Surveyors mined data from voters and released results without consulting with party bosses or candidates. Starting in the 1950s, Mr. Harris helped pioneer a new brand of private political surveying tailored to the needs of an individual client to quickly gauge public reaction to a candidate or a policy. Mr. Harris was also on the vanguard of blending his polling business with his work as a political consultant. He considered himself a political analyst more than a pollster, differentiating himself from industry leaders such as George Gallup who believed the numbers should speak for themselves. Mr. Harris once told People magazine that he did not think a pollster should be a numerical “scorekeeper” in the Gallup mold, likening that role to serving as a “political eunuch. ” “Digging beneath the surface to find out what people think,” he added, “is the obligation of public opinion research. ” As a political consultant for CBS News in the 1960s, Mr. Harris helped shape what Americans now know as the spectacle of televised   coverage by providing simultaneous analysis and predictions of election results earlier in the evening. Pollster Peter D. Hart, who started his career at Louis Harris and Associates before going into business for himself in 1971, said Mr. Harris was an innovator on many fronts. “Lou was to political polling what Henry Ford was to the automobile industry,” he said. After starting his polling firm in 1956, Mr. Harris supplied polling for 45 U. S. senators; 25 state governors, including California’s Edmund “Pat” Brown Sr. (D); a number of congressional lawmakers; mayors, including New York’s Robert F. Wagner Jr. (D); and city officials. Many office seekers sought Mr. Harris’s advice on how to shape their campaigns around certain issues, and others sought his approval before publicly announcing a bid. Before the proliferation of telephone   Mr. Harris honed an ingratiating style of questioning and personally interviewed 3, 000 people in their homes. He avoided simple    questions in favor of conversations that would last as long as 90 minutes. “I’ve stood at bathroom doors, polling women inside taking baths,” he told People. “Once in a home a woman started   her baby in front of me. I went on with the interview anyway. Then her husband appeared. He wasn’t too happy. ” Mr. Harris gained his greatest national reputation when he worked for Kennedy in the 1960 presidential election. Kennedy was not an obvious   at the start of the race. Kennedy feared, Mr. Harris later said, that his political career would be over if he lost to Sen. Hubert Humphrey in the primaries or to   President Richard M. Nixon in the general. Victory in West Virginia, a key Democratic primary, seemed a long shot. The state was Protestant and poor, and Mr. Harris recognized liabilities in Kennedy’s Roman Catholicism and wealth. He had begun polling for Kennedy as early as 1958. “We planned a   program,” Mr. Harris told Time magazine in 1962. “First, to show Kennedy really cared, he would tour the mining towns, and Franklin Roosevelt Jr. would come in to campaign for him, bringing back memories of FDR. Second, we would emphasize that the other Democratic hopefuls were ganging up on him. Thirdly, Kennedy would deal with the religion issue  . ” To do so, Mr. Harris organized the purchase of a TV spot across the state with Kennedy vowing never to take orders from the pope. Kennedy triumphed in the primary, catapulting him to the party nomination. After his win in West Virginia, Kennedy quipped to Mr. Harris: “Lou, you got me into this. Now get me out. ” One of the other major hurdles of the race was the first nationally televised debate, between Kennedy and Nixon. To combat his client’s youthful appearance, Mr. Harris urged Kennedy to craft   responses to highlight his maturity. He also advised Kennedy to show more warmth and slow down his speaking delivery. Kennedy’s tanned skin and vigorous performance contrasted vividly with the pallor of Nixon, who was recuperating from a staph infection. The program, which was watched by an estimated 70 million people, is widely seen as a decisive moment in the campaign and ultimately helped lead to Kennedy’s victory. Mr. Harris, who once estimated that he had done about $700, 000 worth of polling for the Kennedy campaign, continued to poll for Kennedy during his presidential term. “Kennedy would be in a rage when I delivered results unfavorable to him, but he’d call back 15 minutes later and apologize,” Mr. Harris told People. “He and I were on the same wavelength. I could do more with him in four minutes than with others in 40. ” The Kennedy win against Nixon that November made Mr. Harris a force in his industry. He worked, by his count, on more than 200 campaigns before he shifted in 1963 away from private polling to focus more on public polling (through his weekly syndicated Harris Poll) and market research for companies such as Johnson & Johnson, Standard Oil of New Jersey, American Airlines and the National Football League. Mr. Harris also created an affiliate called the National Research Center of the Arts to provide statistical research for cultural organizations.  Louis Harris was born in New Haven, Conn. on Jan. 6, 1921. He was 6 when his father, a real estate developer, died. Mr. Harris was a 1942 economics graduate of the University of North Carolina and served in the Navy in the North Atlantic during World War II. One of his postwar Navy assignments was to survey sailors about the demobilization process. Following his discharge, he served as national program and research director for the American Veterans Committee. Pollster Elmo Roper sought Mr. Harris’s advice for a survey on veterans and, in 1947, hired him to write radio spots and columns about politics. Mr. Harris became a partner at Elmo Roper & Associates but left to start his own firm in New York. Mr. Harris often defended public polling as an instrument for public education on issues and trends, telling the New York Times in 1961 that “to object to political polling is to argue that politicians and the general public should be more poorly informed. ” He believed it his duty to provide explanations of voter behavior to leaders, but he left it to politicians to use that information for the public good. While working for CBS News in the early 1960s, Mr. Harris, with the help of IBM, developed a new method of analyzing election results more quickly and in depth. He improved the network’s election prediction by polling voting blocs ahead of the election and identifying precincts that mirrored the voting patterns of the rest of the state. Mr. Harris later came to regret the impact of his prediction system, saying it may have unduly influenced voters where balloting was still occurring. “We’ve ruined election night for everyone,” he told People in 1976. Mr. Harris sold his firm in 1969 to the investment bank Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette. Gannett acquired the Harris firm in 1975 and owned it for 20 years. The Gordon S. Black Corp. a consulting firm, bought the   Harris Interactive in 1996 and took it public in 1999. Nielsen acquired Harris Interactive in 2014.   He was married to Florence Yard Harris for 60 years until her death in 2004; survivors include three children, Susan Harris of Westhampton, Mass. Peter Harris of Manhattan and Richard Harris of Woodland Park, Colo.; and four grandchildren.  In a career built on dispensing advice to politicians, Mr. Harris was not unexperienced with the rigors and fears of running for elective office. His one bid for editor in chief of the University of North Carolina student newspaper ended in defeat by three votes out of 3, 000 cast. “It was a heartbreaking election,” Mr. Harris told Time in 1962. “It was the first and last time I ever ran for office. ”  Read more  Washington Post obituaries          "

142357,217806,President Obama bans oil drilling in large areas of Atlantic and Arctic oceans,Washington Post,Darryl Fears,2016-12-20,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161221001859/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2016/12/20/president-obama-expected-to-ban-oil-drilling-in-large-areas-of-atlantic-and-arctic-oceans/
","     President Obama moved to solidify his environmental legacy Tuesday by withdrawing hundreds of millions of acres of federally owned land in the Arctic and Atlantic Ocean from new offshore oil and gas drilling. Obama used a   law called the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act to protect large portions of the Chukchi and Beaufort seas in the Arctic and a string of canyons in the Atlantic stretching from Massachusetts to Virginia. In addition to a   moratorium already in place in the Atlantic, removing the canyons from drilling puts much of the eastern seaboard off limits to oil exploration even if companies develop plans to operate around them. The announcement by the White House late in the afternoon was coordinated with similar steps being taken by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to shield large areas of that nation’s Arctic waters from drilling. Neither measure affects leases already held by oil and gas companies and drilling activity in state waters. “These actions, and Canada’s parallel actions, protect a sensitive and unique ecosystem that is unlike any other region on earth,” the White House said in a statement. “They reflect the scientific assessment that, even with the high safety standards that both our countries have put in place, the risks of an oil spill in this region are significant and our ability to clean up from a spill in the region’s harsh conditions is limited. White House officials described their actions to make the areas off limits to future oil and gas exploration and drilling as indefinite. Officials said the withdrawals under Section   of the 1953 act used by presidents dating to Dwight Eisenhower cannot be undone by an incoming president. It is not clear if a   Congress can rescind Obama’s action.  “There is a precedent of more than half a century of this authority being utilized by presidents of both parties,” a White House aide said. “There is no authority for subsequent presidents to  . . . . I can’t speak to what a future Congress will do. ” “The U. S. is not acting alone today. Canada is acting to put an indefinite stop to activity in its waters as well,” the aide said. “With Canada, we send a powerful signal and reinforce our commitment to work together. ” David Rivkin, an attorney for the Baker and Hostetler law firm who served on the White House Counsel staffs of Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush, disagreed with the assertion that the decision cannot be overturned. “Basically I say the power to withdraw entails the power to ” Rivkin said, “especially if you determine the justification for the original withdrawal is no longer valid. ”  A legal fight would likely follow, Rivkin said. But “it’s not clear why Congress would want to give a president tremendous authority operating only one way. ” Sen. Ted Cruz ( .) responded sharply on Twitter: “Yet another Obama abuse of power. Hopefully, on[e] that will be reversed  …    exactly one month from today” after Trump’s inauguration. Cruz closed his tweet with a hashtag: “Taking away Obama’s pen and phone. ” U. S. and Canadian officials have negotiated for months to reach a joint understanding on how to manage adjacent areas in the ocean in an effort to make the new protections as sweeping and politically durable as possible. Meanwhile, advocacy groups lobbied Obama to ban oil and gas leasing in the Arctic entirely.      President Obama banned oil drilling in large areas of the Atlantic and Arctic oceans, using a law called the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act. (The White House)   Obama already invoked the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act to safeguard Alaska’s Bristol Bay in 2014, and again last year to protect part of Alaska’s Arctic coast. The president has protected 125 million acres in the region in the last two years, according to a fact sheet issued by the White House. The Beaufort and Chukchi seas are habitat for several species listed as endangered and species that are candidates for the endangered species, including the bowhead whale, fin whale, Pacific walrus and polar bear. Concern for the animals has heightened as the Arctic warms faster than anywhere else in the world and sea ice the bears use to hunt continues to melt. The underwater canyons protected by the president cover nearly 4 million acres across the Atlantic continental shelf break, “running from Heezen Canyon offshore New England to Norfolk Canyon offshore the Chesapeake Bay,” according to a separate fact sheet. They are widely recognized as major biodiversity hotspots that are critical to fisheries. The canyons provide deep water corals used by a wide array of fish. The area also provides habitat “for . . . deepwater corals, deep diving beaked whales, commercially valuable fishes, and significant numbers of   soft and hard corals, sponges, and crabs,” the White House said. The American Petroleum Institute denounced the decision. “The administration’s decision to remove key Arctic and Atlantic offshore areas from future leasing consideration ignores congressional intent, our national security, and vital,   job opportunities for our shipyards, unions, and businesses of all types across the country,” said Erik Milito, the group’s Upstream director. “Our national security depends on our ability to produce oil and natural gas here in the United States,” Milito said. “This proposal would take us in the wrong direction just as we have become world leader in production and refining of oil and natural gas and in reduction of carbon emissions. ” Contradicting the White House’s statement, Milito said George W. Bush removed previous   withdrawal areas with a memorandum and made all but marine sanctuaries available for leasing. “We are hopeful the incoming administration will reverse this decision as the nation continues to need a robust strategy for developing offshore and onshore energy,” he said. But a wide range of conservation groups hailed the decision. League of Conservation Voters President Gene Karpinski called it “an incredible holiday gift,” saying that “an oil spill in these pristine waters would be devastating to the wildlife and people who live in the region. ” Rhea Suh, president of the Natural Resources Defense Council, called it “a historic victory in our fight to save our Arctic and Atlantic waters, marine life, coastal communities and all they support. ” Carter Roberts, president and chief executive of the World Wildlife Fund, applauded what he called “a bold decision” that “signals some places are just too important not to protect. ” Oil production in the Arctic represents a tenth of one percent of the nation’s oil production overall, the White House said. The area is so sensitive and so remote that the economics of exploration is costly. Shell, which said in September 2015 that it would shelve drilling plans after spending $7 billion and not finding significant amounts of oil, still has one remaining lease in the Chukchi Sea where it drilled a well earlier last year. Shell is also part of a joint venture with Italian oil giant ENI and Spanish firm Repsol in the Beaufort Sea that holds 13 leases. Shell held other leases in the Beaufort Sea, which the company transferred to the Arctic Slope Regional Corp. a company belonging to the Native Americans in the region. An earlier plan to allow limited drilling off the Atlantic coast was shelved after state governments along the southern Atlantic coasts  —   including Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina and Georgia  —   expressed worries over the effect on their beaches, tourist industry and environmentally sensitive marsh. The Navy also objected. The Pentagon provided Interior with a map “that identifies locations   …     areas where the [Defense’s] offshore readiness activities are not compatible, partially compatible or minimally impacted by oil and gas activities,” department spokesman Matthew Allen said. The map included nearly the entire proposed drilling area. Live training exercises are conducted off the Atlantic coast, “from unit level training to major joint service and fleet exercises,” Allen said in a statement. “These live training events are fundamental to the ability of our airmen, sailors, and marines to attain and sustain the highest levels of military readiness. ” The Obama administration eventually closed the Atlantic to drilling for five years.   Donald Trump could counter Obama’s plan with his own   plan, but even so it would be years before drilling could start. The  ’s authority to undo a permanent prohibition is unclear. But Congress, controlled by Republicans, could move to rescind the withdrawal of federal lands from oil and gas exploration.

","  BERLIN  —   The German capital was on high alert Tuesday with one or more attackers still at large in a deadly truck assault on a Christmas market, an act claimed by the Islamic State that struck at the heart of Europe’s Christian traditions. Chancellor Angela Merkel decried Monday’s assault  —   in which a truck carrying a payload of steel plowed into festive stalls and fairgoers in Berlin, leaving 12 dead and dozens injured  —   as a presumed “terror attack,” even as German police scrambled to find the culprit. The only suspect so far  —   a Pakistani asylum seeker taken into custody shortly after the bloodshed  —   was released by police Tuesday because of insufficient evidence. Late Tuesday, the Islamic State, through the affiliated Amaq news agency, claimed that the attacker was a “soldier” responding to its call to target nations fighting the group in Iraq and Syria. The Islamic State has wielded the term before to describe lone wolves inspired by its rhetoric, and its level of involvement, if any, in coordinating the attack remained unclear.   In Germany and across Europe, revulsion and angst over the strike at a symbol of the region’s Christmas traditions sparked governments to act. The holiday spirit was being replaced by muscle.             Caption   German authorities late Monday questioned a male suspect; possibility of terrorism being investigated.

","  MOSCOW  —   A team of Russian detectives arrived in Turkey on Tuesday to join the investigation into the slaying of Moscow’s ambassador by a Turkish police officer  —   an act portrayed by both countries as an effort to rupture a rapprochement between the two regional powers backing opposite sides in Syria’s civil war. The attack Monday also touched off sweeps across Turkey as authorities hunted for clues in the life of the    gunman, who decried the violence in Syria after pumping several bullets into the ambassador at a photo exhibit. Russia is a key ally of Syria’s government, while Turkey has been a stalwart backer of rebel factions, although both nations have worked together on a plan to evacuate civilians and opposition fighters from their last enclave in the embattled Syrian city of Aleppo. Their partnership has effectively sidelined the United States from the diplomatic efforts to resolve the Syrian crisis, and on Tuesday in Moscow, Russia and Turkey, along with Iran, declared their intention to secure a ceasefire.       Officer Mevlut Mert Altintas gunned down Ambassador Andrei Karlov as the diplomat spoke before an exhibition of Russian photos at an art gallery in the Turkish capital of Ankara. After killing the ambassador, Altintas, an officer with the riot police, denounced Russia’s role in the Syrian war, screaming: “Don’t forget Aleppo! Don’t forget Syria!” He was later killed in a gun battle with the police.         The assassination, which was captured in stunning detail by an Associated Press photographer and other journalists, brought into sharp relief the violent worldwide reverberations of Syria’s bloody civil war. The ambassador’s killing has also shocked Turkey, adding to a string of recent militant attacks and political turmoil that have hurt the economy and increasingly isolated the country.   “I believe that every person who is going to Turkey should think twice before doing so, because terror attacks have been happening there on a practically daily basis,” Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Oleg Syromolotov told reporters in Moscow.  Turkey remained on edge on Tuesday, as authorities detained relatives of Altintas and searched his family home in the Soke district, in the west of the country, Turkish media reported. In what appeared to be a separate incident, a man fired shots near the entrance of the U. S. embassy in Ankara overnight. A State Department official said that no one was hurt.   Turkey’s semiofficial Anadolu News Agency said that the embassy gunman, who was identified only as Sahin S, fired several shots in the air with a   rifle he had hidden under his coat early Tuesday.  He was detained and was being questioned, the news agency said. The embassy, as well as the U. S. consulates in Istanbul and Adana, were closed on Tuesday because of the shooting, according to a State Department statement.        Karlov regularly traveled around Ankara without police protection, an unusual decision given the heightened level of threat in the country since an attempted coup in July and a string of terrorist attacks by militant groups, Turkish officials said. While the shooting probe was still in its early stages, investigators are raising the possibility of links between Altintas and a shadowy movement led by Fethullah Gulen, an exiled Turkish preacher who lives in Pennsylvania, according to a senior Turkish official.   Erdogan has accused the movement of mounting the failed coup in July, and since then, Turkish officials have frequently implicated the group in various plots to destabilize Turkey. Thousands of suspected Gulenists have been dismissed or suspended from state institutions, as part of a   purge by Erdogan that has also swept up political opponents and journalists viewed as too critical of the government.   Gulen has denied involvement in the coup, and he released a statement on Monday condemning the killing of Karlov. The Turkish official, who requested anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the news media, said investigators had preliminary information suggesting that Altintas had entered a police college in 2012, after getting referrals from suspected Gulenists. Altintas also took two days off from work on the day of the attempted coup and then traveled to Ankara, the official said.    He was allowed to carry a weapon into the event with Karlov because he was carrying a police identification, officials said. There was not yet any evidence to suggest that Altintas belonged to any radical Islamic groups, such as the Islamic State or the Nusra Front, an   affiliated group, investigators said.  At the time of the shooting, the Turkish foreign minister was on a plane en route to Russia to take part in the meeting with his Iranian and Russian counterparts. The Kremlin has cast the assassination as an attempt by outside forces to sunder ties between Russia and Turkey, but the meeting in the Russian capital on Tuesday served as a reminder of Russia’s growing influence in the region  —   at the expense of the United States.  Russia, Iran and Turkey said they were ready to help broker a Syrian peace deal after the foreign ministers and defense ministers held a series of meeting on Tuesday. The countries issued a statement, which Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu called the “Moscow Declaration,” that called for an expanded ceasefire for which Russia, Turkey and Iran would act as the guarantors.  “Iran, Russia and Turkey are ready to facilitate the drafting of an agreement, which is already being negotiated, between the Syrian government and the opposition, and to become its guarantors,” the declaration said. The three countries “have invited all other countries with influence over the situation on the ground to do the same. ”  Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, hailed the joint initiative as a way to “overcome the stagnation in efforts on the Syrian settlement,” a dig at the United States, which was absent from the Moscow meetings.  Shoigu said that Russia, Iran and Turkey were the only powers able to make a difference in Syria. “All previous attempts by the United States and its partners to agree on coordinated actions were doomed to failure,” Shoigu said. “None of them wielded real influence over the situation on the ground. ” Putin’s involvement in Syria has significant geopolitical meaning, as a way for Moscow to project power and have a foothold in the Middle East. Putin has cast Russia as protector of legitimate leaders against the turmoil caused by rebellions, and criticized the United States and its support for Assad’s opponents.  In a further effort to cement his influence on the Syrian peace process, Putin has said he and Erdogan were trying to organize a new series of negotiations  —   without the involvement of the United States or the United Nations  —   in Astana, Kazakhstan.

142360,217809,How Ed Schultz transformed from MSNBC lefty to the American face of Moscow media,Washington Post,Paul Farhi,2016-12-20,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161221001859/https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/how-ed-schultz-transformed-from-msnbc-lefty-to-the-american-face-of-moscow-media/2016/12/20/320713f4-c322-11e6-8422-eac61c0ef74d_story.html
"," Ed Schultz used to be the bombastic lefty host of a syndicated radio show and daily MSNBC program. He befriended Hillary Clinton, called Donald Trump “a racist” for his birther views, and once beseeched God to take Dick Cheney “to the promised land. ”  In 2014, he ripped Russian President Vladi mir Putin’s “nasty” human rights record. He also torched American conservatives for siding with the Russian president as a counter to President Obama. “Putie is their new hero,” sneered Schultz. But the times have changed. And so has Ed Schultz. In   MSNBC handed Schultz his last paycheck. After six years on the air, the ratings of his daily program, “The Ed Show,” were soft and MSNBC was going for more news in Schultz’s time slot, not opinion. His daily radio show had ended the previous year. So Schultz went back to his lakefront home in Detroit Lakes, Minn. and took stock. At 61, after a lifetime in broadcasting, he concluded he wasn’t done. In early 2016, he returned to television, albeit in an unlikely place and role for a guy who once styled himself as a “prairie populist. ” He became the lead news anchor for RT America, the domestic network of what was once known as Russia Today, a   multimedia organization funded by the Russian government.  Schultz, in other words, went to work for “Putie. ”  The transition would require a bit of adjustment. Schultz now hosts RT America’s signature evening newscast, “News With Ed Schultz,” produced in a studio located three blocks from the White House. Schultz is the American face  —   ruddy, beefy, with a megaphone voice  —   of a   media organization that reports the news a little differently than CNN or NBC. “Good evening, friends,” Schultz boomed on his program one recent evening before swiftly segueing into “the alleged hacking” of the presidential election by Russia. Schultz skipped the latest details, such as President Obama’s views on the matter or the consensus among American intelligence agencies about the extent of Russian meddling. Instead he went straight to Ed Schultz’s view of the matter: “This has become a lifeline for Clinton supporters in an effort to reverse the outcome of the election. . . . In the meantime, the story has entered the arena of outrageous. ” Schultz quickly threw to a recorded package, in which RT America reporter Alexey Yaroshevsky wondered how long the “spiraling downfall of sanity” over hacking in the U. S. media would continue. “Until the public sees forensic evidence, if such exists at all, these accusations should carry as much weight as online humor,” Yaroshevsky reported. Next up: A   panel discussion of Trump’s appointment of ExxonMobil chief executive Rex Tillerson as secretary of state and Tillerson’s ties to Putin.  “Why is [Tillerson’s] business relationships and successes with Russian President Vladimir Putin in the business world and in the energy industry, why is that a negative on Capitol Hill?” he asked the panel, almost pleading. “Isn’t that a positive thing that he knows Putin?” ***  RT, whose slogan is “Question More,” arrived in Washington in 2010, five years after being launched in Moscow by its founder, Margarita Simonyan, at the time a    state journalist. Simonyan, who remains RT’s editor in chief, was also a member of Putin’s   staff in 2012. Schultz, now 62, is one of several Americans who appear on the domestic channel. Others include former New York Times reporter Chris Hedges, who hosts “On Contact,” a weekly interview show featuring “dissident voices”; Max Keiser, who has a financial program; and Tyrel Ventura,   of   show called “Watching the Hawks” and the son of former Minnesota governor and RT personality Jesse Ventura.  RT America has broad distribution via the Internet, but virtually no presence on cable; only 19 cable systems (out of 5, 208 nationwide) carry the channel. Nevertheless, RT claimed this year that it had a weekly TV audience of more than 8 million in the United States  a questionable figure given its limited cable carriage. Schultz, who once said on MSNBC that Putin is “crippling” his country, now has a   or perhaps   viewpoint on any number of issues on his RT program. So do most of the guests he interviews.  The crisis in the Syrian city of Aleppo, besieged by Syrian and Russian military forces? Apparently, it’s the United States’ fault: “You’ve got [Secretary of State] John Kerry supposedly trying to find the peace while the U. S. is being an arms dealer right into the city of Aleppo,” said Schultz on Dec. 8.  Fake online news, allegedly generated by Russian sources? Schultz, a North Dakotan who once considered running for the U. S. Senate as a Democrat, thinks it’s all “fear and hype” by the American news media and a smear by the Democratic Party, especially Clinton. “If they [the American media] want to go after fake news, they can start with the Clinton campaign and their accusations” about Russian involvement, he said on a broadcast in September.  RT America’s approach to the news makes some American officials and   observers wonder: Is it merely “an alternative voice,” as it likes to say, or something more sinister?  Stanford professor Michael McFaul, the former American ambassador to Russia, calls RT “an instrument of the Russian state. Their mission is to advance the mission of Mr. Putin and the [Russian] government. ” By mimicking the look and feel of an American newscast  —   even to the extent of permitting an occasional dissent from the   line  —   RT is trying to “disguise” its real intent, he said. And Schultz is part of the strategy, says McFaul. “They put on a lot of Americans as hosts and journalists,” he said. “The idea is to obfuscate and confuse people about it being a government entity. ”  Schultz, a former college quarterback and sportscaster, rebutted the notion that he or RT America were mouthpieces for the Kremlin. He blamed the news media  —   and Clinton. “The Clinton camp is trying to do all it can to connect Donald Trump to Putin,” he said during a phone interview in early September. “They’re trying to cast anyone on RT in a negative light. I think it’s deplorable. We’re journalists. We’re fair. We have correspondents all over the world. Yes, part of our funding comes from the government. But so does the BBC. So does the Canadian Broadcasting Network. The mainstream depiction of RT is a travesty. It’s dishonest. ” A   question: How does Schultz square his liberal résumé with his current embrace of a   outfit like RT? That question will have to wait. Schultz agreed to another interview in   and even sounded eager about it. But when a reporter came to RT’s Washington office on the appointed day, he was intercepted in the lobby by a network representative. The interview, she said without explanation, was off. Reporters from Politico and the Daily Beast got the same treatment this year. Their interviews with Schultz were canceled at the last minute, too.   to early December. Schultz sounded eager about talking again but deferred final approval to an RT spokeswoman, Tiffany Evans. A few days later, Evans declined via email.  *** The RT gig marks another twist in Schultz’s long and winding broadcast career. Schultz began as a radio and TV sportscaster on stations in North Dakota after his days as a football player culminated with tryouts with the Oakland Raiders and New York Jets. In the   he began a second line, hosting a   show on a Fargo radio station. Schultz was no liberal then. As the Los Angeles Times once described it, “Big Eddie,” as he was known, would scoff at local Democratic officials and deride the homeless. “How about getting a job?” he’d ask on the air.  But the budding Rush Limbaugh underwent a stunning political conversion a few years later, switching from conservative   host to a fiery liberal one. Schultz attributed the conversion to his wife, Wendy Noack, a psychiatric nurse who worked in a Fargo homeless shelter and later became his radio producer. Schultz’s longtime friend from Fargo, Don Haney, thinks the transition was sincere. “The change was gradual, but Ed really meant it,” says Haney, an anchor and reporter at   Schultz’s old station. But others suspected that Schultz merely smelled an opportunity for counterprogramming in a field dominated by conservatives.  In any case,    was no less subtle than his conservative persona. He taunted Limbaugh for his drug addiction and tore into President George W. Bush as an enemy of “the working stiff” (later on, in 2011, he apologized after calling conservative radio host Laura Ingraham “a   slut” on his radio program). But this second guise was Schultz’s most successful. Backed by donations from Democrats, Schultz took his radio program into national syndication in 2004. “The Ed Schultz Show” eventually reached about 100 stations, including those in big cities like New York, Los Angeles, Chicago and Washington.  Among those who came calling was the senator from New York, Hillary Clinton; she sat for several interviews with him and described him as “a personal friend. ”  MSNBC hired him in 2009, just as President Obama took office.  Brent Budowsky, a columnist for the Hill newspaper and an irregular guest on Schultz’s program, says he still views Schultz “as a strong voice for progressive populism. ” Even so, he says, RT promotes the interests of the Russian government, sometimes moving into outright “propaganda. ” Budowsky calls Schultz “a good man in a difficult spot. ” But perhaps a comfortable one, too. In October, Haney saw his old friend again when they traveled to Des Moines to interview Bernie Sanders. They flew there on Schultz’s newly purchased jet, whose previous owner was golf legend Arnold Palmer.  "

"," We were told in June that the Democratic National Committee had been hacked by Russians. We were told in October that material subsequently passed on to WikiLeaks came from the same source. Numerous articles were written about these leaks and about Donald Trump’s many Russian connections. And yet no one was really outraged until now. Why? I have a theory: Until you have seen for yourself how   disinformation works, you laugh at the very idea of it. Once you have understood its power, you stop laughing. If I was slightly ahead of the curve, it’s only because I saw it firsthand. A couple of years ago, I was the focus of a smear campaign. Elements of it could have been lifted out of a spy novel, but the basic idea was quite simple: In the wake of the invasion of Crimea, when I was writing quite a bit about Ukraine, nasty little articles about me started appearing on   websites. The technique was the same as that used by people who later dressed up the stories from the emails of the Democratic National Committee and John Podesta: mix truth and lies  —   my book contract and royalties were described as mysterious income from questionable sources  —   make ludicrous claims, pass on the lies to other   websites, and then watch them pass it on again. There was no way to correct the stories  —   to whom would I complain?  —   and as I’m not running for president, frankly who cares. But it was   to watch the stories move through a   system, one that had been constructed for exactly this sort of purpose. Eventually the articles about me were echoed or quoted in a dozen places: on   websites with ties to Russian business, on Russia Today, and on   American websites like Ron Paul’s Institute for Peace and Prosperity. The process finally peaked in November 2015, when WikiLeaks  —   out of the blue  —   tweeted one of the articles to its 4 million followers.  It was a peculiar experience, but I learned a lot. As I watched the story move around the Web, I saw how the worlds of fake websites and fake news exist to reinforce one another and give falsehood credence. Many of the websites quoted not the original, dodgy source, but one another. There were more phony sites than I’d realized, though I also learned that many of their “followers” (maybe even most of them) are bots  —   bits of computer code that can be programmed to imitate human social media accounts and told to pass on particular stories. The Russians understood the power of such networks to fool people before anybody else. They also understood that the global information space, accessible to all, offered a cheap way for an impoverished   to meddle in other countries’ politics. In my case it didn’t matter, because nobody I know cared about the stories. But during the U. S. election campaign, with millions and millions of bots at work, hundreds of fake stories in circulation and many volunteers joining the troll factories and botnets, maybe   lies and   echo chambers did make a difference The same techniques were at work: take a “truth” revealed in a hacked email, twist it into a scandal, pass it on via   sites, troll factories and botnets, and see whether it sticks. If nothing else, the Russian fake websites and botnets were amplifying Trump’s own campaign, which was using the same tactics too.      (Jason   Washington Post)   None of which means Americans had to fall for it  —   but they did. Why are Americans so vulnerable to fake news, both domestic and  ? Why do they consume it and pass it on? A part of the explanation lies with the Republican Party, which told people for years to hate and fear “Washington” and has now created a constituency that actually prefers information generated by the Kremlin or white supremacists to   or edited news. In this election, the distrust of Hillary Clinton also made people shy away from anyone who seemed to support her.  But it is also true that we are living through a global media revolution, that people are hearing and digesting political information in   ways and that nobody yet understands the consequences. Fake stories are easier to create, fake websites can be designed to host them, and social media rapidly disseminates disinformation that people trust because they get it from friends. This radical revolution has happened without many politicians noticing or caring  —   unless, like me, they happened to have seen how the new system of information exchange works. This is true not only in the United States and Europe but around the world. Half of all Filipinos are active Facebook users, and millions of them shared the scare stories and fake news that helped elect President Rodrigo Duterte, a populist who claims he has personally carried out nonjudicial executions.  There are precedents. The printing press, praised by Martin Luther as “God’s highest and extremest act of Grace,” led to the Reformation, the     and a century of bloody religious wars. The invention of radio led to Hitler and Stalin, who understood the new medium better than anyone else, as well as to the 20th century’s totalitarian regimes and ideological wars.  Eventually equilibrium was reached, and someday we will reach equilibrium, too. But until then we should be prepared for political turmoil of a kind we thought was long behind us.

142362,217812,Trump voters didn’t take him literally on Obamacare. Oops?,Washington Post,Dana Milbank,2016-12-20,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161221001859/https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/trump-voters-didnt-take-him-literally-on-obamacare-oops/2016/12/20/46ef3cae-c6f3-11e6-bf4b-2c064d32a4bf_story.html
"," Donald Trump’s supporters, in conservative writer Salena Zito’s memorable formulation, take him seriously but not literally.  They will be forgiving if, say, he doesn’t literally get Mexico to pay for a border wall, or if he doesn’t literally ban all Muslims from entering the United States. But in other areas, Trump’s supporters perhaps should have taken him literally  —   because they now may have a serious problem.  Vox senior editor Sarah Kliff wrote a poignant account last week of her visit to Whitley County, Ky. where the uninsured rate declined 60 percent under Obamacare but 82 percent of voters supported Trump. There, Kliff, a former Post colleague, found Trump voters who were downright frightened that the   would do exactly  —   literally  —   what he and Republicans promised: repeal Obamacare.  Among those she found was Trump voter Debbie Mills, a store owner whose husband awaits a lifesaving liver transplant; they got insurance through Obamacare, and Mills is hoping the law won’t be repealed.       (Daron   Washington Post)   “I don’t know what we’ll do if it does go away,” Mills said. “I guess I thought that, you know, [Trump] would not do this. That they would not do this, would not take the insurance away. Knowing that it’s affecting so many people’s lives. I mean, what are you to do then if you cannot . . . purchase, cannot pay for the insurance?”  Mills, who supported Trump for other reasons, figured Obamacare repeal was just talk. “I guess we really didn’t think about that, that he was going to cancel that or change that or take it away,” she said. “I guess I always just thought that it would be there. I was thinking that once it was made into a law that it could not be changed. ” Others who didn’t take Trump literally may soon face the same dilemma. The Urban Institute estimated this month that under the partial repeal plan previously passed by Republicans in Congress, 30 million people would lose insurance, 82 percent of them would be in working families and 56 percent would be white. Among adults who would lose insurance, 80 percent don’t have college degrees. “The people hit the hardest are a lot of the demographics that went heavily for Trump,” observes Bob Greenstein, who runs the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal   group.  And it’s not just Obamacare. Take  —   literally  —   Trump’s “Penny Plan,” which would reduce   discretionary spending by 1 percent each year for 10 years. It’s one of the more modest of Trump’s promises, yet Greenstein’s group calculates that, once inflation is factored in, it would require the government to cut by a third what it spends on such things as cancer and medical research, highways, air traffic, the Coast Guard, job training, education, Pell Grants, housing, energy, child care and food assistance, the administration of Social Security and Medicare, national parks, NASA, the IRS, Congress and the courts, disaster assistance, global health and diplomatic protection (remember Benghazi? ).  Take literally Trump’s promise to exempt public safety (the FBI, border control and the like) and other cuts would have to be even deeper. If you suspend credulity and take literally Trump’s promise to eliminate the entire federal debt in eight years, “you would have to eliminate very large parts of the federal government,” Greenstein says. Who needs a military, anyway? Many of the functions that would necessarily face the ax under Trump’s promises  —   job training, education,   assistance and the like  —   benefit groups that were Trump’s strongest supporters. The cuts would disproportionately hurt red states in the South, mountains and plains that receive far more in federal spending than they pay in taxes.  Such actions, undertaken by Trump and his Cabinet of billionaires, bankers and business tycoons, could cause some of those   Trump supporters to regret that they didn’t take Trump’s campaign utterances literally.  Already, GOP lawmakers are trying to soften the blow. The current GOP plan to eliminate Obamacare is repeal and delay: postponing implementation of the repeal by as long as three years.  How would things work after repeal? As a preview of   treatment, Republican Rep. Bill Huizenga offered a personal example to the Michigan news site Mlive: When his son injured his arm, he saved money by not taking him to an emergency room, instead visiting a doctor the next day and discovering that it was broken. Delaying treatment of a broken arm? Trump backers such as those Kliff met in Kentucky may have reason to regret they didn’t take Trump literally before. Mills, the woman whose husband awaits a liver transplant, said she was frightened to learn Obamacare could be repealed without a replacement in hand: “I’m afraid now that the insurance is going to go away and we’re going to be up a creek. ” Seriously.

","   Garrison Keillor is an author and radio personality.       It is hard to believe that the Creator of our universe with its billions of galaxies could have sent Himself to this little blue blip not so long ago in the form of an infant born to a virgin, to be first worshiped by illiterate shepherds where He lay in a feed trough, livestock peering down at Him, Eastern potentates following a star to the site. But here we are again, singing those songs, so we shall see.  My mother loved Christmas with her whole heart. With six children and no credit cards and my father ever watchful for unnecessary expense, Christmas was a mountain for Grace to climb, requiring endurance, planning, stealth and skill, but she brought it off to perfection every year, until she was in her 90s and then she coasted on her memories.  Her mother died when my mother was 7, and Mother had no memory of her, which troubled her deeply. She looked at photos of her mother, tall, haggard, from the early 1920s, and tried to dredge up some recollection, anything at all, the sound of her voice, what she cooked, what her hand felt like. Grace was third from the end of 11 children, the 12th having died with the mother, of scarlet fever, and Grace was raised by her older sisters, Marian and Ruby and Margaret. Complaint was not encouraged in that family, and mental health was not a topic for discussion, but clearly Christmas was a shining moment of gaiety in a family of modest means and strict decorum. When I was 19, my older brother asked me to look after his house over Christmas so he and his young family could drive out to New York for a week. His house was in the woods, and I, intoxicated by Thoreau at the time, was more dramatic than necessary and announced that I would spend Christmas alone out there “to figure things out. ” A poem of mine got in the college literary magazine, with the lines:  The ice is thin and deep is the dark   Below, green lights in the trees and red,   Winding my way into the winter mist.   Coat open and the silver blades are sharp   And that long long bend ahead       (Reuters)    Will take me out and away from you and all of this.   Which was about skating, but a girl I knew thought it was suicidal and she came out to the woods to visit me and bring me dinner from her mother  —   turkey, candied yams, cranberry, in tinfoil. We lit candles and sat and meditated on the mystery of life, and it was pleasant to have someone be so concerned about my  . At the time, I thought of suicide as poetic, an artistic choice stemming from great emotional depths. Two months later, her boyfriend Leeds was killed when a drunk driver pulled out of a parking lot and into his mother’s car coming back home from a play at the Guthrie Theater.   years later, sunk in depression, my friend filled her pockets with rocks and paddled a canoe out to the middle of a lake and capsized it and drowned. Life is good. On a winter night, looking into a fire, our dead are around us, testifying to that. The books on the shelves, the young people around the table, the carols on the radio in the kitchen, the shining snow on the hill that looks out at the Mississippi River.  As you get old, you gain a   life, minus the clutter and hullabaloo, the excess food and alcohol, the meaningless gifts, and it is quite satisfying to sit with your true love in candlelight, a plate of cookies on the table, and let memories come and go. My mother is there. It’s 6 a. m. still dark out, and I’ve come down the stairs in my pajamas to the darkened tree, a note from Santa, the crumbs of the gingersnap I left for him, and I hear the padding of bare feet on the stair, and suddenly the tree bursts into light, and my mother is standing there in a raggedy robe. She missed her dead mother and found her every year in making Christmas for us.  Even after she moved to Florida, she flew back for a proper Minnesota Christmas with frost on the windows and wind in the chimney. What you do for children is never wasted: This Christmas will live on and nourish them long after you have faded away.                 "
142364,217814,Trump makes the feckless Obama look tough on Russia,Washington Post,Jennifer Rubin,2016-12-20,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161221001859/https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2016/12/20/trump-makes-the-feckless-obama-look-tough-on-russia/
","     A report by the American Enterprise Institute’s Fred Kagan,”Understanding Russia today: Russia’s many revisions,” should be required reading in the incoming administration and Congress. He explains: [Vladimir Putin] is redefining Russian identity in the terms the tsars used in the 19th Century —  Russian Orthodoxy, nationalism, and strong government (they called it autocracy, but he does not). He claims the right to renegotiate the terms of the bad deals Russia made with the   states, by force if necessary. He cites the plight of ethnic Russians in the new republics as justification for eroding or even erasing the sovereignty of those states. He seeks to restore Russia to the position of global eminence it had as the Soviet Union by   its positions in the Middle East, Asia, and Africa. He stokes conflict with the West to distract it from these endeavors even as he blames the West for inventing the hostility he has created. The West cannot appease its way out of this  . Putin requires conflict to justify his rule at home and his actions in the territory of the former Soviet Union. But Western appeasement cannot address problems that spring from deep within Russia itself. Putin is encouraging Russians to believe that they must regain suzerainty over their former empire, that they must weaken and fragment the West, that they must cut the United States down to size, and that the West will oppose them implacably in all these endeavors. Appeasement can only draw him into further demands, since he cannot allow the hostility to wane. Kagan offers a measured take on our ability to reverse gains that President Obama allowed Russia to achieve with little penalty. (“The best course for the West in this regard is to refuse ever to recognize Russia’s annexation of Crimea no matter how permanent it seems to have become,” Kagan writes. “The U. S. never recognized the Soviet Union’s seizure of the Baltic States in 1939, after all. Official government maps throughout the Cold War showed those states as part of the USSR with an asterisk explaining the refusal to recognize their  . That asterisk no doubt seemed a silly affectation to many. It helped facilitate the alacrity with which the Baltic States regained their independence as the Soviet system collapsed, however. It is a good model for the right approach to Crimea. ”) Russia’s challenge to the West goes beyond Ukraine and Georgia, certainly. Kagan cautions: Putin’s international revisionism and his hopes of restoring Russia to a nearly   status with the U. S. rest on and feed upon the West’s fear of decline and failure. As long as the West doubts itself or, worse still, believes itself to be the author of the world’s woes and its own suffering, confronting Putin’s efforts to redraft the global order is a hopeless undertaking. The U. S. in particular and its allies as well must recommit themselves to bearing the burden of global leadership, recognizing that failure and responsibility for mistakes is a core part of that burden. Only then can they contest with Putin for the leadership role. The irony is that the man who comes to the Oval Office promising to make America great again has only underscored doubt and confusion in the West. Adopting Putin’s denials of hacking, rationalization for Syria (Russia is fighting terrorists!) and contempt for democratic norms empowers our most formidable international foe. Donald Trump’s insistence on keeping his businesses and flouting the emoluments clause also echoes Putin’s assertion that the West’s democracies are corrupt and hypocritical, and therefore lack standing to attack his domestic corruption and human rights violations. If Trump and his secretary of state are as savvy as they would have us believe, they will start cutting Putin down to size. That would necessitate frank talk about his meddling in democratic elections, his suppression of domestic dissent (and yes, the untimely deaths of journalists) his violation of international law (including abetting genocide in Syria) and his personal corruption. Trump should know that Putin respects only strength, so why not show some rather than doubling down on Obama’s fecklessness?"
142365,217815,Defunding Planned Parenthood could be the GOP’s first big defeat of the new year,Washington Post,Paul Waldman,2016-12-20,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161221001859/https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2016/12/20/defunding-planned-parenthood-could-be-the-gops-first-big-defeat-of-the-new-year/
","     We’re now a month away from the inauguration of Donald Trump, and only a couple of weeks away from the   of a new Congress, one that at long last knows that it no longer has to worry that its bills will be vetoed by a president from the other party. As you might expect, many Republicans are giddy with excitement over all the new laws they’ll be able to pass, as they remake America into a paradise of liberty, prosperity and strong   values. But there’s danger lurking there, too, because a whole bunch of promises they’ve made in recent years are now going to have to be kept, and they won’t have a Democratic president to use as an excuse for avoiding ideologically important but politically perilous actions. For now I want to focus on just one of those actions: defunding Planned Parenthood. This is going to be one of the first items on the Republican agenda, not because the leadership necessarily relishes having a fight over it, but because Republican activists are already demanding it, and they will not be denied. This is likely to be big trouble for Republicans  —   indeed, it could be their first major legislative defeat next year. Just to clarify, “defunding” Planned Parenthood has nothing to do with abortion, because federal funds can’t go to abortion services. The funds in question are mostly Medicaid reimbursements: a woman on Medicaid goes to a Planned Parenthood clinic for a gynecological exam, a cancer screening, or some other health service, and Medicaid pays the bill. What Republicans want to do is bar women on Medicaid from getting their health care from Planned Parenthood. They passed such a provision last year, and President Obama vetoed it.       After Donald Trump’s many shifting comments about women’s health and reproductive rights, some women are worried about what will happen under the new administration. (Jenny   Washington Post)   Courts have struck down state laws that tried to prevent Medicaid patients from using Planned Parenthood, and the Obama administration just instituted a federal rule barring states from denying Medicaid patients the ability to get care from the organization’s clinics. But that could be overridden by a new law Congress passed and President Trump signed. But is that the first fight this new Congress wants to have? Polls show that clear majorities, ranging from around 55 to 65 percent of the public, oppose the Republican effort to defund Planned Parenthood. And it’s a loser in two ways: Republicans want to do something unpopular in the service of a different but equally unpopular goal (making abortions illegal or impossible to obtain).  Yet they have almost no choice. After committing themselves so publicly to the defunding  —   and almost shutting down the government in order to do it  —   Republicans have to move on it early, or risk a revolt from antiabortion activists who are always suspicious that their priorities are going to be put on the back burner when the GOP takes power. Yet despite the party’s total control of government, there are multiple points at which this effort could fail. First, there’s the matter of the filibuster, which Senate Democrats would definitely use to stop any effort to defund Planned Parenthood. Republicans will have 52 seats in the new Senate, and it’s unlikely they could get even a single Democrat to join them on this, let alone the eight they’d need to overcome a filibuster.  But they could try to attach it to a bill passed through “reconciliation”  —   which requires only a   majority  —   most likely a partial repeal of the Affordable Care Act. There are two problems there, however. Reconciliation bills can deal directly with only questions that have budgetary impact, and a ban on Planned Parenthood funding doesn’t increase or decrease the deficit, it merely tells women that they can’t go to certain clinics. Furthermore, it’s not certain that Republicans could even get the 50 votes they’d need, if they could somehow get a ruling from the parliamentarian that a defunding measure qualified for reconciliation. Maine’s Susan Collins is already on record opposing it, as is Lisa Murkowski of Alaska. Democrats would need to find only one more Republican to stop it.      Republican presidential   Donald Trump has repeatedly stated that he supports Planned Parenthood’s women’s health programs  —   just not abortion. (Peter   Washington Post)   Finally, there’s no telling where Trump will fall down on this issue, since his ideas about Planned Parenthood are muddied, to say the least  —   during the campaign he praised the group yet said he also supported defunding it. But his vice president, Mike Pence, is one of the most virulently   politicians in America, so chances are that if a defunding measure made it to Trump’s desk, there would be enough people directly around him pressuring him that he’d sign it. But it probably won’t reach Trump’s desk, which would mean the worst of all possible worlds for Republicans: They wouldn’t get the policy victory they want, but they’d suffer the backlash from trying to do so. And if they do manage to pass it, the news will be filled with horror stories from women who used to rely on Planned Parenthood for their health care but now can’t find providers, all because a bunch of antiabortion zealots in Washington wanted to tell them which doctor they could go to. It’s another reminder that when you’re in the opposition, making promises is easy. You can hold symbolic votes, secure in the knowledge that you won’t be held accountable for your actions. But once you have power, you have to come through for those who stood by you  —   even if it means doing something that will make the broader public very unhappy. Planned Parenthood funding may be the first time Republicans find themselves in that position in 2017, but it won’t be the last.  "

","     “Oh, I totally disagree with that. ” “That” was the assertion in a 2012 New York Times profile of Valerie Jarrett that “if Karl Rove was known as George W. Bush’s political brain, Ms. Jarrett is [President] Obama’s spine. ” Jarrett’s immediate pushback in the 20th episode of “Cape UP” explains why she is the   senior adviser to a president in a town famous for inflating egos and corrupting souls. She never forgot for whom she worked. Make no mistake: Jarrett is very proud of her accomplishments. But she insists, as she has consistently for nearly eight years, that all of the credit goes to the boss in the Oval Office. “There isn’t an initiative that I’ve worked on since I’ve been here that he didn’t bless,” Jarrett said of the president. “If he didn’t care about the issues that I have put the shoulder to the metal behind, they wouldn’t have happened and they wouldn’t have been my priority. ” LISTEN HERE  For more conversations like this, subscribe to “Cape UP” on iTunes or Stitcher. Two years ago, I wrote about four straight African American men who led the way in our nation’s historic advancement on equality for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender Americans. But Jarrett was the black woman in the middle of it all. When I pressed during the podcast interview that she was indeed the person who kept Obama focused, for instance, on LGBT rights, Jarrett was having none of it. “I doubt your underlying premise there that he gets off track and loses his focus; he just doesn’t,” insisted Jarrett at a table in her West Wing office. “His spine is perfectly strong. I think it’s a disservice to him to think that he needs somebody to keep him focused. He wakes up every morning reminding himself and all of us of why we’re here. That important quality in him is what has enabled all of us to do our jobs successfully. ”    Valerie Jarrett, senior adviser to President Obama, talks with The Post’s Jonathan Capehart during an interview in her West Wing office for the “Cape UP” podcast on Dec. 8. (Carol   Washington Post)  Jarrett has served as the president’s link to communities and constituencies across the country and has loved every minute of her job through Obama’s two tumultuous terms. “It’s been a privilege each and every single day even on our worst days,” she told me. “I can’t imagine that I would trade what I’ve been able to do with anyone in the world. ” And there is no question what one of those worst days was. “The worst weekend, which began on a Friday through Sunday, was when those 20 amazing kids and six adults were murdered at Sandy Hook Elementary School,” she said of the Newtown, Conn. mass shooting on. Dec. 14, 2012. “And then two days later, just two days later, I accompanied the president to Newtown.   …     I walked around with him, family by family, and some of those families have become very close friends of mine to this day. But to see people on the worst day of their life, mourning a child, is just excruciating. ” [The one difference between Jarrett and others who wielded the same kind of power is that she’s a woman] Jarrett talked about the president’s recurring role as mourner in chief, including his “Amazing Grace” moment in Charleston, S. C. during his eulogy for the pastor of Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church, who was murdered with eight of his parishioners on June 17, 2015. “It pulled us all together and unified us in a way that the words to that song are uniquely able to do,” she said.

142367,217817,"Emails between Clinton and top aide, but little else, spurred FBI to resume controversial probe",Washington Post,Matt Zapotosky,2016-12-20,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161221001859/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2016/12/20/emails-between-clinton-and-top-aide-but-little-else-spurred-fbi-to-resume-controversial-probe/
","     The FBI told a federal judge that it needed to search a computer to resume its investigation of Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server because agents had found correspondence on the device between Clinton and top aide Huma Abedin but they did not know what was being discussed, according to newly unsealed court documents. The bureau argued that Clinton and Abedin were previously on email chains in which classified information was discussed, and so there was probable cause to search a computer belonging to Abedin’s estranged husband, disgraced former congressman Anthony Weiner, for information potentially related to the Clinton email case. That search  —   along with FBI Director James B. Comey’s decision to tell Congress that the investigation into Clinton’s email practices had resumed  —   came less than two weeks before the election and upended the presidential campaign.  U. S. Magistrate Judge Kevin Nathaniel Fox approved a search warrant in the case, but the FBI is likely to draw criticism that it relied on flimsy evidence to resume its Clinton probe. E. Randol Schoenberg, the Los Angeles lawyer who sued to have the warrant unsealed, said he saw “nothing at all in the search warrant application that would give rise to probable cause, nothing that would make anyone suspect that there was anything on the laptop beyond what the FBI had already searched and determined not to be evidence of a crime, nothing to suggest that there would be anything other than routine correspondence between Secretary Clinton and her longtime aide Huma Abedin. ” “I am appalled,”  Schoenberg said. The FBI and a lawyer for Abedin declined to comment for this story. A lawyer for Clinton did not immediately return a message. The documents largely lay out what agents had already found in the case, which Comey had in July declared he was recommending be closed with no charges. The agent wrote that the government had determined 2, 115 emails on the Clinton server were classified  —   2, 028 at the confidential level, 65 at the secret level and 22 at the top secret level, which is the most sensitive. The agent wrote that 27 email chains containing classified information went through Abedin accounts: Six contained information classified secret at the time it was sent, and 21 were classified confidential. The agent wrote that  —   given thousands of Abedin emails were found on the computer belonging to Weiner, including some that appeared to have been sent while Clinton was secretary of state  —   there was probable cause to believe their correspondence contained classified information. At the time the agent applied for the warrant, the FBI was working on limited information. Agents were reviewing the laptop in the context of the Weiner   investigation and could look at header information, but could not look at the contents of emails belonging to Abedin because they were outside the scope of their authority to search. Weiner’s and Abedin’s names are redacted from the newly released documents, but they were confirmed by a person familiar with the case. Edward B. MacMahon. Jr. a   defense attorney who has handled   cases involving classified information, said he believed agents seemed to have acted appropriately in obtaining the warrant to search Weiner’s computer.  “Look, probable cause is such a low standard,” MacMahon said. “The way I read this is they’re saying they found another computer that may have had additional emails on it, and they wanted to search that computer. That’s completely consistent with what the FBI would want to do in a case like this. ” Comey wrote to Congress on Oct. 28, two days before the FBI obtained the warrant, to announce agents were resuming their work on the Clinton email case. Agents in an  “unrelated case,” he wrote, had found emails that “appear to be pertinent to the investigation. ” Law enforcement officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity, soon revealed that case was the investigation of Weiner’s alleged sexting with a    girl, and on Oct. 30, the FBI obtained the warrant to look more thoroughly at Weiner’s computer for   materials.  U. S. District Judge P. Kevin Castel unsealed the warrant and related documents at the request of Schoenberg, a lawyer specializing in art theft cases. Schoenberg sued for the materials’ release, arguing that, because of the questions surrounding the Clinton email investigation and the impact of the FBI’s decision to resume it on the eve of the election, the public deserved to know more. On Nov. 6, Comey announced that investigators had concluded their review and found no reason to change their earlier conclusion about Clinton. Government lawyers initially opposed unsealing the warrant but soon dropped their objection. The FBI had already released on its website an extensive summary of its investigative efforts before the case had resumed, as well as dozens of interview summaries with witnesses in the case. Clinton took no position on the release of the warrant. Read more:  Trump will shut down Clinton investigations? That’s not how it’s supposed to work.

"," The way Tyshika Britten saw it, she had a choice. She could explain to children who still believe in Santa Claus that some years are harder for him than others. She could stand on the street with a sign and a bucket. Or she could turn to an unlikely place for help  —   Craigslist. She began typing. “I am a mother of six, 5 boys and 1 baby girl,” she began. Then in a single paragraph, she laid out how her family would soon be evicted from their Maryland home, how she had yet to buy a tree or gifts, how this was the first time she might not be able to give her children a Christmas. “I’m so hurt,” the    hairstylist wrote. “I’m trying my best. I pray everyday and now I’m begging for help. I know its not about the gifts, but they are kids! I’m such a failure right now . . . please help me. ” At a time of year when the lines at food banks seem to become longer and the phones at nonprofits ring nonstop, Britten is not the only parent to ask for help this year on a site normally used to find free furniture and cheap services.    Tyshika Britten’s family is facing eviction, but she still wants her kids to have Christmas. She bought a tree for $5 at the Family Dollar store but doesn’t have money for gifts. (Jonathan   Washington Post)  Across the nation, similar pleas on Craiglist reveal the pressure the holidays put on poor and   families. Many already struggle to pay their bills and can feel overwhelmed by the extra financial burden of gifts and trimmings. Their postings tell of single mothers and unemployed fathers. They list parents’ ailments and children’s ages. Some offer work in exchange for help, while others promise blessings and appreciation.   There is no way to tell how many are legitimate, just as there is no way to know if a post advertising free clothes is a lure for something more sinister. But organizations that work with families in need say they are not surprised that parents are looking everywhere and anywhere for help at Christmastime.  “It’s a   time, and there is a bit of desperation,” said Mark Bergel, the founder of A Wider Circle, a nonprofit in Silver Spring, Md. that serves families in need throughout the Washington region. “Some folks will start calling for help with the holidays in May. ”  The organization, which offers several ways for families to receive new toys, gets nearly 500 calls a day. This season alone, the group will serve about 2, 500 children and adults, giving them all holiday gifts that have been donated by the community. Even then, Bergel said, it’s not enough. “It’s our philosophy to not say no,” he said, “so this season is especially difficult because there is so much demand, and we can’t say yes to everyone. ” At Cornerstones, a Northern Virginia nonprofit agency that provides shelter and support to families in need, the staff fulfilled 1, 300 wish lists for children in the Reston and Herndon areas alone. Northern Virginia Family Services, a nonprofit agency based in Oakton, will give about 2, 100 children gifts through a donation program.   Tyshika Britten poses with her children, left to right: Nazhia Bolden, 11, Donnell Booker, Jr. 8, Morgan Booker, 1, Chase Booker, 3, Nevaeh Bolden, 13, and Vashon Bolden, 15. (Jonathan   Washington Post)  Nationally, more than one in three children are growing up in   working families, according to data from the Working Poor Families Project. In the Washington region, which has some of the   counties in the nation, more than one in four children fall into that category.  Bergel said the needs differ from one family to the next, but there seems to be a shared theme to all the requests: “There are a lot of moms looking to provide some joy this holiday season. ” The same could be said of the Craigslist listings. “I am a single mom of three,” begins one in Fairfax, Va. “I am a stay at home mom of 4 children,” starts another from Montgomery Village in suburban Maryland. “They say trouble don’t last always,” wrote Juanita Herrin, 34, of Annandale, Va. “I am a divorced mother of 4 battling lupus. ” Herrin, 34, said she turned to the site in desperation after getting turned down for help from several nonprofit agencies. She recently started a cleaning service, but she said it’s a struggle to pay bills and keep up the insurance for her business, and still provide a special day for her children, ages 6, 11, 13 and 15. “I don’t want any money from anyone,” Herrin said. “I just want my kids to open up something on Christmas Day. ” Britten’s children were still asleep when she woke up at 4 a. m. and posted her ad on Craigslist. She had advertised her hairstyling services on the site with success and decided to turn to it now, when she needed help most. “I had nothing to lose,” she said. “It’s been hell this year. Everything just started crashing under us at one time. ” Britten said she went back to cosmetology school this year because her fiance, Donnell Booker, was earning enough at his construction job to handle their $1, 450 a month rent in Oxon Hill, Md. But then his hours were reduced and the bills piled up. A look at one of his recent paychecks shows that he earns $17 an hour, and on a week when his gross pay totaled $204, after deductions for taxes and child support, his check was for $21. Britten said this has meant the family has been late on rent and now faces an eviction that could come any day. In the months leading up to Thanksgiving, their water and gas were turned off. To cook, they used an electric skillet, and for water, they ran a hose across the street from a generous neighbor’s house. “Once one domino fell, they all started falling,” Britten said. “Christmas is just breaking my heart. A lot of people say it is not about the gifts. I know that. I know that as an adult. But as a kid, you don’t want to process that. ” Her    son wants new clothes the family can’t afford. Her   and    have asked for a PlayStation   console that is out of her budget. Her    son hasn’t requested anything specific, but as he sat in the family’s living room a recent afternoon, he excitedly recalled what was waiting for him under the tree last year. “I got books and a bubble gum machine and a puzzle,” Donnell Booker Jr. said. Then, just as quickly as the   started talking about gifts, he stopped. He knows his family is struggling this year. In the corner of the room, a tree his mother bought for $5 at the Family Dollar store leaned against a wall on a broken stand. “It’s mainly for getting together with your family,” Donnell said of the holiday. His    brother Chase Booker climbed into his lap and disagreed. “Christmas is for getting toys,” he said quietly. “And trucks. ” In the week since Britten’s posted her plea, she has received two responses. One was from a woman who asked for more information and then never wrote back. And the other was from a man who typed: “Are you still looking for assistance? Are you a BBW?” Britten knew that was shorthand for “Big beautiful woman,” and told him she wasn’t interested in his help. He responded, saying he wasn’t looking for sex, just a picture of her feet. Britten said she knew when she posted on the site that she would be opening herself up to unsavory responses. People have to be discerning on both sides of the exchange, she said. Craigslist has been linked to murders and other brutal crimes across the country.  But if anyone doubts that there are real people behind these pleas for help, Britten said, she invites them to come spend time with her family. “I wouldn’t sit here and do this if I didn’t have to,” she said. “I’m willing to do anything I have to do for my children. I’m tired of struggling. I’m tired of them struggling. I just want them to be happy. ”   Read more:    He slept at the airport when he couldn’t afford the trip home. He won’t have to anymore.

142369,217819,The worst candidate of 2016,Washington Post,Chris Cillizza,2016-12-20,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161221001859/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/12/20/the-worst-candidate-of-2016/
","     Candidates matter. We learned that lesson for the umpteenth time over the past two years as races  —   from the presidential on down  —   turned on the quality of the candidates. As a consultant put it to me a long time ago: If the dog doesn’t like the dog food, it doesn’t matter how good the marketing campaign for it is. Today we tackle the candidate who voters sniffed at and decided to pass on. Tomorrow, the flip side  —   the best of the best candidates of 2016. WINNER: Hillary Clinton It’s impossible to overstate how big a favorite the former secretary of state was in both her primary fight against Bernie Sanders and the general election matchup against Donald Trump. She was the biggest     for the White House in modern political history. And yet, from the start, it was clear that Clinton’s appeal on paper didn’t match her appeal in the real world of political campaigning. She badly underestimated Sanders’s appeal from the start and then, because of ongoing doubts about her commitment to liberal causes, found it difficult to attack the senator from Vermont. As a result, a primary that was expected to be a coronation turned into a   problem  —   exposing the lack of enthusiasm for Clinton, particularly among young voters. A   matchup against Trump was expected to be a fix for what ailed Clinton’s primary effort. After all, faced with a choice between Clinton’s deep résumé and Trump’s bluster and showmanship, voters really had only one serious option, right? Clinton might not be exciting or represent the change voters wanted but no way, no how would people pick Trump, right? Those assumptions led Clinton to run a campaign that can be summed up thusly: “I’m the one not named Donald Trump in the race. ” Turns out that wasn’t enough for voters. Trump, for all his talk and inexperience, represented radical change. Clinton represented more of the same politics people hated.      During a speech in Cincinnati, Dec. 1,   Donald Trump said he had ’a lot of fun’ running against his Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton. (The Washington Post)   It’s easy  —   too easy  —   to blame the election result on Trump’s appeal to our more coarse emotions and views. Clinton, so the argument goes, ran a serious campaign for serious times, while Trump ran a reality TV show that the   media ate up. Sure, Trump took advantage of the media’s obsession with and need for clicks and ratings. But that’s not why Clinton lost. She lost because she was overly cautious. Because she was slow to adjust to a changed race  —   in the primary and the general election. Because she never really connected with voters. Because she offered no positive message that resonated with those voters. Because she never grasped the import to her candidacy of the email story. Because she simply wasn’t a good candidate. Given the stakes of the presidential race, there can be no winner for the worst candidate of the year other than Clinton. Although Clinton ran away with first place, there were lots of other truly bad candidates who ran for office over the past two years. Here are a few of the best of the worst: * Evan Bayh: When the former senator from Indiana decided at the last minute to join the race for the Hoosier State’s open Senate seat, it was taken as definitive proof that Democrats were on their way to winning back the Senate majority. Initial polling showed him with a   lead over   Rep. Todd C. Young (R). But Bayh’s candidacy turned disastrous. It turns out that he didn’t spend much time in the state he wanted to represent  —   a remarkable error given that Sen. Richard G. Lugar (R) had lost on residency issues in 2012  —   and had lots of sketchy ties to the lobbying world. Young and Republicans brilliantly executed a campaign that turned Bayh from beloved native son to bored rich guy looking for a cushy job. Bayh wound up losing by 10 points, a stunning   swing from the original polling.      The Fix’s Chris Cillizza breaks down why Republican Todd Young’s win in Indiana’s Senate race is important. Young defeated Democrat Evan Bayh, a former Indiana governor who held the Senate seat for 12 years. (The Washington Post)   * Jeb Bush: Remember when Jeb was the de facto Republican nominee? It feels like 100 years ago. The former Florida governor ran the perfect campaign  —   raise huge sums of money, stockpile endorsements  —   f0r 2000. Unfortunately, the Republican electorate changed dramatically since his older brother first won the White House 16 years ago. Jeb(!) never really knew what hit him. Watching him campaign was painful; he seemed deeply uncomfortable and ill at ease, like he didn’t want to be there.       Even if Bush had been a better candidate, I’m not sure he would have gone very far in the presidential race. He was status quo at a time when people wanted change. But that he was so awkward as a candidate made it all the more miserable for him. Nice man. Bad candidate.      It’s been a long election season, but there were some great moments; here are a few of our favorites. (Peter   Washington Post)   * Ted Strickland: Like Bayh, Strickland, the former Ohio governor, was seen as a prized recruit in a key Senate swing state. And like Bayh, early polling showed Strickland with a comfortable lead over Sen. Rob Portman (R). Strickland seemed to be only loosely committed to the race  —   unwilling to do the work necessary to beat a very good candidate in Portman. The Democrat’s fundraising was consistently atrocious and the race was over by Labor Day. Portman’s   margin is what happens when a great candidate and a terrible candidate clash. It was an absolute walkover."
142370,217820,A black doctor barred from helping on a flight gets an apology — and triggers a policy change,Washington Post,Carolyn Y. Johnson,2016-12-20,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161221001859/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/12/20/a-black-doctor-barred-from-helping-on-a-flight-gets-an-apology-and-triggers-a-policy-change/
","     In October, physician Tamika Cross took a Delta Air Lines flight home from the wedding of a childhood friend. A man fell ill and a call went out for medical help. But when Cross tried to come to his aid, a flight attendant dismissed the young, black doctor. ”We are looking for actual physicians or nurses,” the flight attendant said, according to Cross. The story, shared via Facebook, triggered thousands of comments, and an outpouring of stories from minorities and women who had faced skepticism from people who didn’t think they looked like doctors. Now, Cross’s experience has helped trigger changes in Delta policy. As of Dec. 1, the airline has stopped requiring medical professionals to furnish credentials before assisting passengers.    From left to right, Allison Ausband, a senior vice president at Delta Air Lines, with physicians Tamika Cross and Wayne Riley. (courtesy of Tamika Cross)  “When situations like the one described by Dr. Cross arise, we have a responsibility to our employees and our customers to review the circumstances and our policies for opportunities to listen, learn and improve,” said Allison Ausband, senior vice president for   Service in a statement.   In the immediate aftermath of the incident, Delta put out a statement saying that the airline’s policy was to request medical credentials before allowing a sick person to be treated  . Cross did not show her credentials, but another passenger did, the airline said. Cross saw two problems with that. Medical doctors don’t necessarily carry their hospital badge or have a medical license on hand, particularly if they’re flying home from a wedding or going on vacation. And the policy was being implemented inconsistently; Cross had heard from diverse groups of people, who had sometimes been asked for credentials and sometimes not when trying to help sick passengers on flights. Delta invited her to meet with executives at its headquarters, and Cross went. She asked Wayne Riley, a mentor and past president of the American College of Physicians to come with her. He told Delta executives that he had assisted with passengers in distress on several Delta flights over the years and never been asked to prove he was a doctor.  ”Delta found that there is no legal or regulatory requirement upon the airline to view medical professional credentials. And, as it becomes more and more common for medical licenses to be verified online, physicians and nurses often do not carry a license with them and some states no longer issue wallet versions,” the airline said in a statement. The company will also next year expand its diversity and inclusion training to ”frontline employees,” including flight attendants, the statement said. Cross’s story forced out into the open a discussion that has been bubbling under the surface for  years, as it has become clear that every day people of color face unintentional bias. These are different from overtly racist beliefs, but can influence people’s behavior in ways that appear similar. Implicit biases may lead us to make quick assumptions    for example, assuming a doctor will be a white man    even when our rational minds know otherwise. Cross was hurt and angered by the way she was treated on the flight, but such attitudes are a depressingly common experience. She spoke out because the incident could have put a man’s life in danger. Cross said she’s satisfied with the apologies received, including from Delta’s chief executive, Ed Bastian. She’s pleased that something good could come out of a negative experience. ”I think we were able to get some things changed that were outdated with a major corporation and do things to make other medical professionals feel comfortable offering assistance when they’re 30, 000 feet in the air,” Cross said.

","     It’s not normal, and it’s happening again. For the second year in a row in late December and for the second time in as many months, temperatures in the high Arctic will be freakishly high compared to normal. Computer models project that on Thursday, three days before Christmas, the temperature near the North Pole will be an astronomical   degrees    and approaching 32 degrees, the melting point.   Impressive  …     model guidance (eg, GFS) indicating surface air temperatures hovering just below freezing at the #NorthPole later this week pic. twitter.   —   Zack Labe (@ZLabe) December 20, 2016   On some forecast maps simulating Arctic temperatures, the color bar does not even go as high as predicted levels.    GFS model forecast temperature difference (in Celsius) from normal in the Arctic on Thursday. (University of Maine Climate  )  The warmth will be drawn into the Arctic by a powerhouse storm east of Greenland. The European weather model estimates its lowest pressure will be around 945 millibars, which is comparable to many category 3 hurricanes. “That’s pretty intense,” said Ryan Maue, a meteorologist with WeatherBell Analytics.    European model forecast low pressure center of 946 millibars east of Greenland Wednesday helping draw mild air into the Arctic through the Nordic sea. (WeatherBell. com)  Maue explained that depleted sea ice cover east of the Nordic Sea helps create a passageway for warm air to surge north uninhibited. “You have more real estate available to advect the warm and moist air northward,” he said.    Simulation of high altitude temperatures from European model shows mild air from the south streaming through the Nordic sea towards the North Pole. (WeatherBell. com)  Arctic sea ice levels are at a record lows. In November, the Arctic usually gains ice, but over a period of five days it saw 19, 000 square miles of ice cover vanish, which NOAA called “almost unprecedented”.    (National Snow and Ice Data Center)  Zachary Labe, a doctoral student researching the Arctic at the University of   said that the lack of ice in this region has allowed ocean temperatures to warm to levels well above normal. “The warm ocean acts as a buffer to keep the air temperatures from getting colder,” Labe said. Air temperatures in the Arctic above 80 degrees north (latitude) have been much warmer than normal since roughly September.    (Danish Meteorological Institute, adapted by Capital Weather Gang)  The “persistence and magnitude of above average Arctic temperatures continues to remain quite impressive” Labe said on Twitter. The month of November was an incredible 18 degrees warmer than normal in the Arctic, the National Snow and Ice Data said. Richard James, who holds a doctorate in meteorology, found November produced the most anomalously warm Arctic temperatures of any month on record after analyzing data from 19 weather stations.     Temperature difference from normal in Arctic in November. (Climate. gov)  In the middle of the month, the temperature averaged over the entire Arctic north of 80 degrees latitude spiked to 36 degrees above normal.  Ted Scambos, a scientist at the National Snow and Ice Data Center, said that he was struck that an area “the size of the entire contiguous U. S. had temperatures that far above the norm, all at the same time. ” The anomalous warmth to close out 2016 follows a very a similar event at the end of 2015 when Arctic temperatures surged over the melting point.      This   map displays a progression of changing global surface temperature anomalies from 1880 through 2015. Higher than normal temperatures are shown in red and lower then normal temperatures are shown in blue. (NASA)    The question the research community is grappling with is whether these huge temperatures spikes are becoming more common. “I don’t think anyone can for sure say,” said Labe. “The variability in the Arctic is tremendous. It usually does bring in brief periods of very warm weather [compared to normal]. ” WeatherBell’s Maue agreed, saying the big Arctic storms which have drawn mild air into the Arctic both this year and last year are part and parcel of Atlantic weather variability. A study published in the journal Nature on Dec. 15 said these events have happened once or twice a decade going to back to the 1950s. While it’s premature to say if these events are becoming more frequent, the intensity of the warm air reaching the Arctic is almost certainly increasing. “[T]he warmest midwinter temperatures at the North Pole have been increasing at a rate that is twice as large as that for mean midwinter temperatures at the pole,” the Nature study said. “It is argued that this enhanced trend is consistent with the loss of winter sea ice from the Nordic Seas that moves the reservoir of warm air over this region northwards making it easier for weather systems to transport this heat polewards. ” When these excessive warm anomalies occur in the Arctic, the cold air which is usually present must go somewhere. In November, it piled up in Siberia and that is poised to happen again:   Whoa Vlad! That’s some cold air in central Russia.   °F pic. twitter.   —   Ryan Maue (@RyanMaue) December 20, 2016   And eventually some of the cold air in Siberia crossed the pole and dived into North America in  .

142372,217822,Tech giants pledge to keep children out of cobalt mines that supply smartphone and electric-car batteries,Washington Post,Peter Whoriskey,2016-12-20,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161221001859/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2016/12/20/tech-giants-pledge-to-keep-children-out-of-cobalt-mines-that-supply-smartphone-and-electric-car-batteries/
","       Separate groups of the world’s leading technology companies are launching two initiatives to curb “the worst forms of child labor” and other abusive practices in the supply chain for cobalt, a key ingredient in   batteries that power smartphones, laptops and electric cars. About 60 percent of the world’s cobalt originates in the Congo, where   mines rife with dangers attract legions of poorly equipped “artisanal” miners who work for as little as $2 a day. Apple, HP, Samsung SDI and Sony have joined an effort known as the Responsible Cobalt Initiative. It is being led by a Chinese business group, the Chinese Chamber of Commerce for Metals, Minerals and Chemicals Importers and Exporters, and supported by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) according to the Chinese group. Members of the initiative pledged to follow OECD guidelines for mining supply chains, which call for companies to trace how cobalt is being extracted, transported, manufactured and sold. Any abuses would require immediate correction. Advocacy groups have alleged for years that cobalt was posing deadly risks to miners and causing environmental damage, but eradicating the worst abuses has proved difficult because tracing cobalt in consumer products back to the mines involves global leaps  —   from Africa to China to world markets  —   and across many companies.   The Washington Post earlier this year published an investigation detailing abuses in Congo’s artisanal cobalt supply chain, showing how miners  —   including children  —   worked in dangerous, at times deadly conditions as they tunneled hundreds of feet underground for dollars a day to reach the precious mineral. The article also showed the potential health effects, including birth defects, that medical researchers have begun to connect to the mining activity. The Post for the first time connected this troubling artisanal cobalt trade with the batteries used by some of the world’s largest technology companies, including Apple.  Apple acknowledged that this cobalt has made its way into some of its batteries and said it was committed to working with its supplier to address underlying issues, such as extreme poverty, that result in harsh work conditions and child labor. The role of the Chinese business organization in the new initiative is considered a key advantage  —   the bulk of the supply chain runs through that country. Several companies with key roles in refining and packaging the mineral for batteries have joined the initiative, including Zhejiang Huayou, a Chinese company that buys cobalt from Congo miners and was featured in The Post’s coverage. “The problem cannot be fixed by one company,” said Bryce Lee, Huayou’s new manager for responsible sourcing. ”So I think it’s great, surprising even, that so many companies have come together.” The new initiative is “a very positive sign of change, ” said Tyler Gillard, project head for the OECD. “Such strong involvement of Chinese industry in particular is uncommon for these types of initiatives and really exciting. ” Collectively, the group is aiming to promote cooperation with the government of the Congo. Separately, a business group known as the Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition has announced the new “Responsible Raw Materials Initiative. ” The EICC said companies need to expand scrutiny of their supply chains beyond the traditional four “conflict” minerals covered by U. S. legislation  —   tin, tungsten, tantalum and gold. These minerals, when taken from the Congo region, receive extra attention because of potential ties to funding militias. The EICC said the decision to begin looking at other minerals was motivated by “a growing body of research”  —   including work by advocacy groups and The Post  —   that showed abuses occurred in the production of these other minerals, too. Bob Mitchell, EICC vice president for social and environmental responsibility, said one of the minerals the initiative is considering is cobalt from Congo. The EICC announced its initiative last month, just before the start of a U. N. forum on business and human rights. Membership in the EICC includes Apple, Dell, Foxconn, Ford Motors and other companies, and 19   companies have signed pledges to support the new initiative, Mitchell said. Exactly what to do about the artisanal mining of cobalt is a matter of heated debate. The practice is rife with dangers. On the other hand, it also helps desperately poor people make a living, particularly in the rural areas of Congo. Some   critics of the cobalt supply chain view the Responsible Cobalt Initiative merely as a good first step. “Implementation is obviously what it’s all about,” said Mark Dummett, an Amnesty International researcher who has studied cobalt supply chains. “We’d now like to see the downstream companies like Apple and Samsung disclose the names of their cobalt smelters as well as disclose the risks they have identified in their supply chains. ” Companies said a collective effort such as this is required to eradicate any abuses in the cobalt supply chain. “HP recognizes that in order to build leverage over supply chain actors that we do not have a direct business relationship with, we need to work with other companies and organizations to drive collective action,” Jay Celorie, HP’s global program manager for human rights, ethics and compliance, said in a statement. Other companies, such as Tesla and LG Chem, said they are weighing membership in the Responsible Cobalt Initiative or undertaking other ways of ensuring that their supply chains are clean and humane. “We are evaluating a number of new international initiatives to address the issues in cobalt production and are working quickly to determine how Tesla can be most effectively involved,” Tesla said in a statement. Other industry groups are responding to complaints about the cobalt supply chain, too. Last week, Umicore, a large   maker of battery parts and other cobalt products, announced that the auditing firm Pricewaterhouse Coopers had validated the safeguards it has in place to prevent the use of any cobalt arising from questionable environmental or labor practices. Among other things, the company seeks to be able to trace the origins of every bit of cobalt that goes in its products. Umicore officials said that seeking the   validation of their cobalt procedures should ease the concerns of the consumer companies that are their customers. “Our customers have valuable brands to protect,” said Marc Van Sande, executive vice president of a company business unit. This approach “provides comfort to customers about the provenance and the ethical nature of the cobalt used in the materials they source. ” Related stories: The batteries in your favorite devices are literally covering Chinese villages in black soot Indigenous people are left poor as tech world takes lithium from under their feet    "

","  Accused rapist on campus? University should have told us, students say https:  .  pic. twitter.   —   AJC (@ajc) December 19, 2016   For three years, Benjamin Holm walked the Catholic campus at Loyola University in Chicago like any other student, pursuing a double major in finance and economics and playing for the school’s golf team. But his life in Chicago hid the reality he faced back home in the suburbs of Atlanta. There, he was being investigated for rape. Holm had been accused of and arrested in the crime in the spring of 2013, weeks before his high school graduation and five months after he had committed to playing golf at Loyola, but his trial didn’t start until the end of last month  —   more than three years after the alleged sexual assault. And it seems throughout that lengthy span, nobody at the university knew of Holm’s pending rape trial, not as his charges were upgraded to felony status while he was already on campus or even when he pleaded guilty to aggravated assault and statutory rape Dec. 5. Media reports about the rape case published last week  —   in which the university refused comment  —   were followed by days of outrage from Holm’s former Loyola classmates, which included a change. org petition signed by more than 1, 200 people demanding an explanation from the university. “Students at Loyola University Chicago are disgusted by the institution’s actions and do not feel safe on campus,” wrote sophomore student Ashley Kennedy. “The administration’s silence is only making things worse. ” On Dec. 16, 11 days after Holm pleaded guilty to the sexual assault, the university issued a statement from Title IX coordinator Thomas M. Kelly, who oversees sexual assault education and enforcement on campus. To our knowledge, we neither received information about the crime, nor had any awareness that it occurred until Monday, December 12, when we received a media inquiry. Based on media reports, the individual is in police custody in Georgia. The individual is not registered for classes in the Spring Semester. Violence of any kind is not tolerated at Loyola, and the safety and security of all members of our campus community remain a top priority.

A photo posted by Loyola University Chicago (@loyolachicago) on Nov 4, 2016 at 7:18am PDT    The uproar comes at a critical juncture in the national controversy about sexual assault at America’s college campuses, an issue that in 2016 became more prominent in part because of White House initiatives, publicity about Rolling Stone’s   article about a gang rape that wasn’t at the University of Virginia and several high profile cases. Just this week, the California judge who sentenced Brock Turner to six months in jail for sexually assaulting a woman on the Stanford University campus was cleared of judicial misconduct by an independent state agency after critics called for him to resign because of what they considered an unjustly light punishment.         At the University of Minnesota, the football team for two days last week refused to play in an upcoming bowl game because players disagreed with the way campus officials handled the suspensions of 10 of their teammates accused of sexual assault. An ongoing investigation at Baylor University in Texas this year revealed a widespread, chronic pattern in the football program of covering up alleged sexual assaults involving football players. And in recent months, athletic teams at a handful of colleges, including several Ivy League universities, have faced discipline for digital conversations deemed inappropriate by officials that included lewd language and physical rankings of women or other female athletes. Other, less   incidents have been chronicled in lawsuits challenging the fairness of Title IX investigations for both the accuser and the accused. But what sets Holm’s case apart is that the assault occurred before the   stepped onto campus  —   something the university emphasized in its statement. “In the past few days, Loyolans have expressed concern following media reports related to a   who was charged and pled guilty to a   violent crime that occurred in his home state of Georgia,” the Dec. 16 statement said. “This crime occurred prior to the individual joining Loyola. ”   While awaiting his rape trial, a Johns Creek grad played 3 years of college golf. Now, Ben Holm is headed to prison https:  .  pic. twitter.   —   Alexis Stevens (@alexisnews) December 13, 2016   Critics in the online petition argued that the university should keep closer tabs on its   who are often offered additional resources and scholarship money not granted to an average student. A 2012 article published in the North Fulton Herald reported that Holm was offered an athletic scholarship when he committed to playing golf at Loyola, but the university Athletic Department would not confirm that information in an interview with the student newspaper. The university publication, the Loyola Phoenix, wrote: The Loyola Athletic Department had no comment on the situation, wouldn’t disclose information regarding Holm’s possible scholarship and didn’t confirm whether he had athletic or academic scholarships. Loyola’s Athletic Director Steve Watson and Deputy Director of Athletics Jermaine Truax, the administrator in charge of the golf program, declined multiple interview requests from The PHOENIX. According to the Atlanta   Holm’s case began in April 2013, when during a high school party weeks before his graduation, the     sexually assaulted a    girl at a playground at the Country Club of the South, Johns Creek police said. The victim’s friends grew worried when she disappeared, police told the AJC, and eventually found her at the playground. Her pants were down, police said, and Holm was on top of her. “They observed the sexual assault taking place and heard her clearly saying ‘No, stop,’ ” Capt. Chris Byers of the Johns Creek police told the AJC. He was initially charged with statutory rape, a misdemeanor in Georgia, and pleaded not guilty. He bonded out of jail and headed to Loyola’s campus several months later. Nearly two full years after the incident, in April 2015, according to a timeline from the Loyola Phoenix, the county solicitor determined Holm should have been charged with felony rape, and a year later, in April 2016, a grand jury issued an indictment on the upgraded, more severe charge. That spring, Holm left the Loyola golf team for unspecified reasons, reported the student newspaper. Holm pleaded not guilty again, according to the Phoenix, and on Nov. 28 his trial began. It wasn’t until jury deliberations that Holm, now 21, reversed course and decided to take a deal offered by the prosecution, pleading guilty to aggravated assault and statutory rape. He received a   sentence, 10 of which he would serve in prison and the other 10 on probation, according to the AJC. He was booked into the Fulton County Jail.

142374,217824,Airports have discovered how to make people happier about waiting for their planes,Washington Post,Thomas Heath,2016-12-20,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161221001859/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/business/wp/2016/12/20/airports-have-discovered-how-to-make-people-happier-about-waiting-for-their-planes/
","     Airports are getting more love from travelers when they act like a mall. More and more, air passengers are responding positively to the Rodeo   and gourmet restaurants that continue to pop up across airports, according to J. D. Power’s annual survey of large, North American airports. As amenities on planes have been taken away, the airports themselves have gotten more luxurious. “There is a high, positive correlation in our data between those people who are extremely satisfied . . . and the amount of money they spend in the airport,” said Michael Taylor, director of airport practice at J. D. Power. “They spend twice as much when they are extraordinarily satisfied with the airport. ” Portland International Airport in Oregon took first place among the survey’s 39, 000 respondents, rated  “among the best” in terminal shopping, terminal facilities and overall satisfaction. “Twenty, thirty years ago, there was Duty Free, a kiosk and that was about it for an airport terminal,” said Bojan Jokic,   of Epteca, a   firm that works with companies to increase sales and services to travelers. “With some of these airports now, if you didn’t know you were at an airport, you’d think you were at the shopping mall somewhere. ” Jokic said terminals and airports are increasingly becoming more like real estate companies than public transportation utilities. The retail brains and developers are realizing that airports provide a huge concentration of people with, sometimes unfortunately, a lot of time on their hands. “Airports are looking to distinguish themselves from other airports,” said Steve Baker, vice president for customer and concessions development with Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority. “If you are looking at a decision to go into the country or across the United States, then you are looking at how you are going to be treated in the process. A part of that process is what you are able to do in the time between flights or while you wait for your flight. ” Epteca’s Jokic said it took airports a long time to realize the value of their real estate. Copenhagen Airport was one of the first to get it more than a decade ago when it hired a new director, who had headed one of the largest department stores in the Danish city. The new director quickly realized there was an underused asset in front of him, according to Jokic. “What you see now is the curve of their revenue is switching. Many of the best airports are making as much on   revenue as air traffic revenue. ” According to the Airports Council   America, an airport industry association, food, beverage and retail businesses paid more than $1. 3 billion in 2015 to airports to operate their outlets on airport property. That represents about 15. 8 percent of airport   revenue. In the United States, all airports are owned publicly and operated by a city, county, or state government or airport authority, according to the association. Airports in other regions of the world are either operated by a private    entity or wholly owned by a shareholder corporation. Jokic predicts that with   fares throughout Europe, some day travelers may jet to another city just to shop or eat at the terminal. “It’s possible that airports become destinations themselves,” said Jokic. “Can it be that people might say, ‘I am going to hang out in the Munich or whatever airport?’ So with $20 flights, you can go from Copenhagen to London to go check out the airport mall?” The Los Angeles Times ventured that part of the reason behind a rise in satisfaction toward Los Angeles International Airport may lie in a $300 million renovation to one if its terminals where “several hip new eateries were added, including SeaLegs Wine Bar and Slapfish from Huntington Beach,    stop the Pie Hole, Asian food Pick Up Stix, Fresh Brothers Pizza, organic fare from Ciabatta Bar and Built Custom Burgers. ” Dulles International and Reagan National airports outside D. C. are getting in on the act. “For the last three years, we’ve been doing a complete concessions overhaul of both Reagan National and Dulles International airports to offer broader food and retail options for our traveling public,” said spokesperson Kimberly Gibbs. “This is to improve the overall travel experience. ” The list of restaurants and shops at Dulles International Airport, which ranks 20th in the J. D. Power survey, reads like a list of Beverly Hills addresses: Burberry, Estee Lauder, Coach, Kitchen by Wolfgang Puck, Swarovski, Michael Kors, Vino Volo Wine Room, Chef Geoff, Bar Symon, Tumi, Thomas Pink, Montblanc and, of course, Starbucks. Even a   restaurant called Burgundy and Gold, including memorabilia from the NFL team, will open next year at Dulles.  The J. D. Power survey covered seven areas of passenger experience: overall satisfaction, airport accessibility,   security, terminal facilities, baggage claim and terminal shopping. Respondents could choose ratings among the following:  Among the Best, Better than Most, About Average and The Rest. Here are the top 10 airports, according to the survey: 1. Portland International 2. Tampa International 3. McCarran International (Las Vegas) 4. Orlando International 5. Miami International 6. San Diego International 7. Salt Lake City International 8. Toronto Pearson International 9. Reagan National Airport (D. C.) 10. Chicago Midway New York’s LaGuardia Airport finished last among the 32 largest North American airports.  "
142375,217830,"Tunisian suspect in Berlin Christmas market attack faced past German terror probe, official says",Washington Post,Anthony Faiola,2016-12-21,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161222013856/https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/german-police-in-search-for-new-suspect-in-deadly-christmas-market-attack/2016/12/21/066055d8-c6fd-11e6-acda-59924caa2450_story.html
","  BERLIN  —   The prime suspect sought in the deadly attack on a Berlin Christmas market  —   a    Tunisian migrant  —   was the subject of a terrorism probe in Germany earlier this year and was not deported even though his asylum bid was rejected, a senior German official said Wednesday. The suspect  —   who went by numerous aliases but was identified by German authorities as Anis Amri  —   became the subject of a national manhunt after investigators discovered a wallet with his identity documents in the truck used in Monday’s attack that left 12 dead, two law enforcement officials told The Washington Post.  Meanwhile, a clearer portrait took shape of the suspect, including accusations that he had contact with a prominent Islamic State recruiter in Germany.  German authorities issued a 100, 000 euro ($105, 000) reward for information leading to his capture, warning citizens not to approach the      Amri, whom they described as “violent and armed. ” His record, however, further deepened the political fallout from Monday’s bloodshed  —   pointing to flaws in the German deportation system and putting a harsh light on Chancellor Angela Merkel’s humanitarian bid to open the nation’s doors to nearly 1 million asylum seekers last year.        Although the vast majority of those who flooded into Europe were on the move to escape war and unrest, dozens of terrorism suspects have slipped into Germany and neighboring nations posing as migrants. Amri, officials said, was not part of the surge of migrants who entered Europe via the onetime main route from Turkey and Greece  —   a path that has been now largely cut off. Rather, he came to Germany last year via Italy, where he apparently had entered as early as 2012. He applied for German asylum but was rejected in June and later faced deportation. Amri was the subject of a terrorism probe on suspicion of “preparing a serious act of violent subversion,” and he had known links to Islamist extremists, authorities said. Why a failed asylum seeker with such links and no passport was walking German streets is “the question 82 million Germans probably want an answer to,” said Rainer Wendt, Chairman of the German Police Union. He added: “How many more ticking time bombs are roaming around here? . . . We saw how much damage one person can do with a truck. ”  The dragnet for the suspect appeared to initially focus on the German state of North   as well as Berlin, both places where the Tunisian suspect once lived. Police units had been due to stage raids Wednesday, officials said, but they remained mysteriously on hold.     45 years of terrorist attacks in Europe, visualized View Graphic     45 years of terrorist attacks in Europe, visualized  The interior minister in North   Ralf Jäger, said the Tunisian man had bounced around Germany since arriving in July 2015, living in the southern city of Freiburg and later in Berlin.  Although authorities have sought to accelerate the deportation of rejected asylum seekers this year, there is still a backlog in Germany of tens of thousands, many of whom are able to resist because their countries of origin refuse to take them back. Amri, Jäger said, was one of them.  Amri had not been deported because  —   like many asylum seekers in Germany  —   he did not have a passport. The Tunisian government, Jäger explained, initially denied that he was a national and delayed issuing his passport. Pending his deportation, Amri had received a “toleration” status from the government.  Amri’s new Tunisian passport, Jäger said, finally arrived Wednesday. “I don’t want to comment further on that circumstance,” said a visibly angered Jäger.    Importantly, authorities knew that Amri had “interacted” with Abu Walaa, a    of Iraqi descent arrested in November on charges of recruiting and sending fighters from Germany to the Islamic State. Key evidence in Walaa’s case came from an Islamic State defector who had returned to Germany and accused Walaa of helping to recruit him and arrange his travel to Syria.   “Anis Amri was engaging with extremist salafist circles in Germany,” a German security official said. According to Karen Müller, spokeswoman for the Berlin prosecutor, Amri had also been under police surveillance for several months until September of this year, because he was suspected of planning a burglary in Berlin to finance the purchase of  weapons. The suspicion wasn’t confirmed. He was, she said, found only to be a   drug dealer.  The leaking of the suspect’s name and photograph in the press, authorities said, may have upset attempts to find him. Germany’s interior minister, Thomas de Maizière, would tell reporters in Berlin only that Germany had registered “a suspect” as wanted on European databases. He refused to give further details. The two German law enforcement officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive case, said investigators discovered the man’s documents in the cabin of the truck that barreled into the market. It remained unclear whether authorities believe the Tunisian man drove the truck, but police nevertheless made tracking him a priority. Revelation of the asylum seeker’s background sparked outrage among conservative politicians and seemed set to damage Merkel, who is running for reelection next year. “There is a connection between the refugee crisis and the heightened terror threat in Germany,” said Stefan Mayer, parliamentary spokesman on domestic affairs for the Christian Social Union party. “This can also be seen in the case of this Tunisian. ”   Donald Trump on Wednesday appeared to stand by his plans to establish a registry for Muslims and temporarily ban Muslim immigrants from the United States. Speaking outside his    resort in Florida, Trump did not walk back the proposals after he was asked by a reporter whether he was rethinking or reevaluating them in the wake of a fresh terrorist attack in Berlin. “You know my plans,” Trump said. He went on to add that the attack on a Berlin Christmas market, which was claimed by the Islamic State, had vindicated him.  “All along, I’ve been proven to be right. One hundred percent correct,” Trump said. “What’s happening is disgraceful. ”  Germany’s Bild newspaper said Amri had several aliases and was apparently born in the southern Tunisian desert town of Tataouine in 1992. Witnesses described one man fleeing the scene after the truck  —   packed with a cargo of steel  —   roared into revelers at a traditional Christmas market. One suspect, a Pakistani asylum seeker, was arrested Monday night, but authorities later released him because of a lack of evidence. The new information emerged as German investigators raced for clues in the hunt for Amri and other possible suspects in the assault. They pored over forensic evidence and GPS data as they sought to retrace the steps of the runaway attacker. They were   witnesses and analyzing DNA traces found in the truck, as well as on the body of a dead Polish man in the passenger seat.  The Pole worked for a trucking company and was delivering a payload of steel to Berlin. Investigators are going on the assumption that he was taken hostage by the assailant  —   and may even have died a hero. Jörg Radek, deputy chairman of the German Trade Union of the Police, said evidence suggested that “a fight took place in the driver’s cabin. ” As it barreled toward the crowded market, the truck was not driving straight, but “in a zigzag line,” he noted.  The Islamic State on Tuesday claimed responsibility for inspiring the unknown attacker  —   a claim as yet unproven and possibly just opportunistic. But it prompted some politicians to quickly point the finger at Merkel’s refu gee policy, even as others pushed back, calling the accusations a politicizing of tragedy that had no place in progressive Germany.  There were also growing calls for the deployment of more police on the streets with   weapons  —   an unusual move in pacifist Germany. At the normally quaint and picturesque Christmas markets in at least three German cities  —   Mainz, Magdeburg and Dresden  —   concrete barriers were quickly erected to add security. In Magdeburg, police officers armed with automatic weapons were guarding the entrance. Yet others argued that living in a free society was perhaps more important and that Germans were willing to accept a certain measure of risk to preserve that openness.  “If we want to maintain the freedom of our society, we simply have to live with the risk contained in this decision,” Die Tageszeitung said in a Wednesday editorial.  Dan Eggen in Washington contributed to this report.       "
142376,217831,North Carolina lawmakers leave ‘bathroom bill’ in place,Washington Post,Mark Berman,2016-12-21,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161222013856/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2016/12/21/north-carolina-lawmakers-gather-to-consider-repealing-bathroom-bill/
","     North Carolina lawmakers failed Wednesday to repeal a law regulating transgender people’s use of public restrooms, despite convening in a special legislative session for the express purpose of rescinding the controversial law. The legislature adjourned Wednesday evening after a brutal day in which Republicans feuded over whether to fully or partially repeal the measure, and Democrats accused them of reneging on a pledge to eliminate completely the   “bathroom bill,” which requires people to use the public restroom that matches with the sex on their birth certificate regardless of their gender identity. After a series of attempts to come to an agreement, the Senate voted down a bill to repeal the law and the House adjourned without acting. They are both scheduled to convene next in January. Gay and transgender rights groups immediately condemned the outcome of the   session, and criticized Republicans for preserving the “hateful” legislation that had led to boycotts, cost the state millions of dollars in lost tourism revenue and prompted the NBA and the NCAA to move games.  “Today, the public trust has been betrayed once again. Lawmakers sent a clear message: North Carolina remains closed for business,” Chad Griffin, president of the Human Rights Campaign, said in a statement. Republicans, meanwhile, blamed Democrats, who rejected a version of the repeal that would have included a   moratorium on cities passing nondiscrimination ordinances to protect gay and transgender people. They also blamed the   Attorney General Roy Cooper (D) who had paved the way for repeal by negotiating an agreement with the city of Charlotte to pull back a nondiscrimination ordinance it had enacted earlier this year. “Make no mistake: Roy Cooper and Senate Democrats killed the repeal” of the bill, Senate Leader Phil Berger (R) said in a statement. “Their action proves they only wanted a repeal in order to force radical social engineering and shared bathrooms across North Carolina, at the expense of our state’s families, our reputation and our economy. ” The special session came amid intense acrimony in the North Carolina political scene, as Republican lawmakers recently passed legislation aimed at stripping power from the Democratic   who in turn has threatened a lawsuit.   The disaster & shame caused by #HB2 was created by #NCGA for no reason other than hate & fear mongering. Accept nothing but full repeal.  —     Carolina (@ACLU_NC) December 21, 2016   A proposal Berger had introduced Wednesday would have repealed the bathroom bill, also known as House Bill 2 or H. B. 2. But its imposition of a temporary ban on any local government effort to “enact or amend an ordinance” regulating access to restrooms angered groups that had long opposed H. B. 2, which, in addition to its bathroom provision, also reversed local ordinances expanding protections for LGBT people. Gov. Pat McCrory (R) who this month conceded to Cooper, had called the special session on Monday, hours after Charlotte city officials said they would repeal the nondiscrimination ordinance the city passed in February. State lawmakers hastily introduced H. B. 2 in March, and McCrory quickly signed the bill, setting off a firestorm. McCrory, a former Charlotte mayor, has long criticized the city’s measure as “government overreach” and said H. B. 2 was needed to combat that ordinance and protect women. Opponents of the bathroom bill, a group that includes the Justice Department, decried it as discriminatory, and big businesses and sports leagues echoed these concerns, halting planned expansions and relocating numerous games. The   proposed Wednesday did not satisfy gay and transgender rights groups, who pledged to continue to fight a state law that they had criticized as one of the most discriminatory in the nation. “It is unacceptable. It’s a gimmick. It’s H. B. 2. 0,” said Mara Keisling, president of the National Center for Transgender Equality. “It’s not okay and any legislature that would do that wouldn’t really be doing that for only six months. ”   Our #HB2 lawsuit marches on. We will continue to fight this blatant discrimination against #LGBT NCers in court. #NCGA #NCPol  —   Lambda Legal (@LambdaLegal) December 22, 2016   The ugly battle in North Carolina could be a deterrent for other states to either pass broad   measures or enact laws regulating bathroom use by transgender people. Still, transgender rights groups expect a number of states to propose the latter next year. Among them is Texas, where Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick (R ) has said passing a “women’s privacy act” will be one of his top priorities next year.   Earlier Wednesday, the Charlotte City Council held an emergency meeting to repeal its own ordinance in full, a move meant to spur state lawmakers into action. A spokeswoman for the city said the repeal vote Monday had affected only the part of the ordinance dealing with public accommodations, such as bathrooms, which council members thought would “sufficiently [fulfill] the requests of the general assembly” and lead to H. B. 2’s repeal.  Some state Republicans were critical of Charlotte for its partial repeal. Dallas Woodhouse, executive director of the North Carolina Republican Party, posted a statement on Facebook saying that Cooper and the Charlotte City Council “lied to the public about a full repeal,” and his group went on to call this a “dishonest, disgraceful shame. ” Charlotte Mayor Jennifer Roberts (D) pushed back against the party’s statement, saying in an email to The Washington Post that the state GOP “is incorrect and they need to stop playing politics with people’s lives. ” In a statement Wednesday night, the city of Charlotte said officials there are “disappointed with this unfortunate outcome. ” “The Charlotte City Council acted in good faith to do everything it understood was needed to necessitate the state legislature repealing HB2,” the statement said. The socially conservative North Carolina Family Policy Council had urged members Tuesday to call lawmakers to demand that they vote no on a repeal. Dan Forest, the state’s Republican lieutenant governor, said that even if the bill was repealed, “we will fight this battle all over again with another city or county. ”  “The names will change, but the national groups who are pushing this agenda will not stop until their social engineering is accomplished,” Forest, a supporter of H. B. 2, said in a statement Wednesday morning. On the other side, a newspaper in the liberal city of Asheville argued that the compromise was a losing proposition for gay and transgender people  —   as well as the state. “Even if everything goes as planned, the damage done to the state’s reputation is a bell that cannot be unrung,” the Asheville   editorial board wrote Tuesday. “Further, Charlotte’s gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender residents are back where they were a year ago, without the protections they deserve. ”      Demonstrators in Raleigh, N. C. urge the repeal of House Bill (HB2) which has put North Carolina at the center of a national debate over LGBT rights. (Reuters)    Opponents of expanded transgender rights say that allowing explicit protections, particularly in the public sphere, not only breaks with   social mores when it comes to gender and bathrooms but could open the door to sexual predators gaining access to women’s restrooms. Rights groups, however, contend that such arguments are rooted in offensive stereotypes and do not reflect the reality of most transgender people, who have already been quietly using their preferred bathrooms without incident.    Protesters decrying the bill gathered outside the governor’s mansion in March. (Jill   News & Observer via AP)  After the bathroom bill was signed, musicians including Bruce Springsteen, Pearl Jam and Ringo Starr canceled shows in North Carolina, while Cirque de Soleil scrapped several performances in the state. The NBA, which has a franchise in Charlotte, moved this season’s   Game from that city because of “the climate created by” H. B. 2. The NCAA took even more extensive action, relocating the seven championship games set to take place in North Carolina during this season, including two rounds of the lucrative men’s Division I basketball tournament. Big businesses, including Google and Apple, spoke out against the law. PayPal, a   online payment firm, and Deutsche Bank, a German financial giant, called off planned expansions in North Carolina. These expansions would have brought a combined 650 jobs to North Carolina and been worth millions of dollars to the state, officials said.

","         NEW HAVEN, Conn.  —   A major increase in international enrollment in recent years has intensified the competition for entry to America’s top private colleges and universities, as   numbers of applicants angle for the limited supply of seats. That tension is particularly evident in the eight prestigious Ivy League schools: Federal data shows that their freshman classes grew slightly from 2004 to 2014  —   5 percent  —   while the number of incoming foreign students rose 46 percent. At the same time, applications to the schools shot up 88 percent. At Yale University, where just 6 percent of 30, 000 applicants are accepted, the foreign share of the freshman class has grown from single digits to 11 percent. As Yale’s undergraduate enrollment has edged upward since 2004, foreigners have accounted for almost all of the growth, reflecting a deliberate strategy to deepen Yale’s engagement with the world. “We want to bring together an in cred ibly diverse student body  —   diverse in every way,” said Jonathan Holloway, dean of Yale College. “If we want to train the next generation of global leaders, we better have the globe here. ” Foreign and domestic demand grew so high that Yale has embarked on its biggest expansion since its undergraduate college opened to women in 1969. Next fall Yale will open two new residential complexes, a $500 million project to lift enrollment capacity 15 percent.    International growth has fostered an increasingly cosmopolitan culture on campuses across the country, with academic benefits for domestic and foreign students alike. It gives colleges an additional path toward ethnic and racial diversity, opening doors to students from Africa, Asia, Latin America and Europe. But it also injects pressure into the admissions scramble that U. S. high school seniors are starting to experience this month as schools release   decisions.    Harkness Tower at Yale. (Stan   The Washington Post)  Charles Deacon, dean of admissions at Georgetown University, said he is concerned that international enrollment could be nearing an unacceptable level at some schools by potentially crowding out qualified U. S. students. “We’re in a global world,” Deacon said. “There certainly is an argument for the presence of foreign nationals at U. S. universities. But is there a tipping point where this is too many? That is an issue we have to reckon with. ” The international share of freshmen at Georgetown rose from 3 percent in 2004 to 11 percent in 2014, on par with Yale. During that time, Georgetown’s admission rate fell 5 points, to 17 percent. Deacon said those numbers are reasonable for a university in the nation’s capital with a school of foreign service and a global profile.  “We think it works well for us,” he said. U. S. applicants to elite schools are largely unaware of the growth of international enrollment and what it could mean for their chances, said Bruce Vinik, an admission consultant in Montgomery County, Md. He said the subject could draw “pretty strong” reactions from students anxious about whether their   schools will accept or reject them.  “Some kids would probably be upset it has increased competition and made it tougher to get into these colleges,” Vinik said. “Others  —   quite a few, actually  —   would see the benefits” of diversity. Except for a brief period after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, international enrollment at U. S. colleges has grown for generations.  “Based on history, we think the United States will continue to be a destination of choice and foreign students will continue to want to come here, for all the reasons they come here today,” said Allan Goodman, chief executive and president of the Institute of International Education. There were about 427, 000 international undergraduates at U. S. colleges and universities in the   school year, according to the IIE. That was up 79 percent over a decade ago. The top supplier was China, followed by Saudi Arabia, South Korea, India and Vietnam. Among these students is Yifu Dong, 21, a Yale senior from Beijing majoring in history. His father writes columns for a Chinese newspaper, and his mother is a civil engineer. They are a   family, Dong said, and he receives financial aid. “It’s   for me,” he said. “Your ideas are constantly being challenged. I really like this kind of education, the liberal arts. ”    Yifu Dong, 21, of Beijing, attends Yale University. (Stan   The Washington Post)  The foreign influx has helped offset stagnation in the annual supply of graduates from U. S. high schools. Public universities often use international recruiting to help balance budgets when states cut funding for higher education. At the University of California at Berkeley, federal data shows the foreign share of freshmen in 2014  —   13 percent  —   was four times higher than in 2004. Many   private colleges have similar motives, seeking to fill seats with students who can pay full or nearly full price.    But the calculus is different for   private schools with an abundance of qualified applicants. For these schools, going global often appears to be more of a strategic choice than a financial necessity. Some give international students significant financial aid. Federal data on “nonresident aliens” shows the international share of freshmen doubled at Duke University, from 5 percent in 2004 to 10 percent in 2014. The share also doubled at Brown University, to 12 percent, and Columbia University, to 15 percent. It quadrupled at Claremont McKenna College, to 20 percent. The only Ivy League schools with   international shares in 2014 were Dartmouth College (8 percent) and Cornell University (9 percent). The share at highly ranked Stanford University was 8 percent. At the 50 schools that U. S. News and World Report ranks as   national universities or liberal arts colleges, the number of freshman seats in those schools grew 14 percent from 2004 to 2014, to about 65, 000. The number of freshmen who were foreigners more than doubled, to about 6, 900.       Admission rates, meanwhile, plummeted, meaning that it is far more difficult for applicants to gain acceptance. About a dozen schools routinely reject at least 90 percent of applicants, a threshold rarely reached a decade ago. Stanford, the most selective, now turns down 19 of every 20 students seeking admission. For U. S. applicants, the increase in foreign competition adds another layer of difficulty. They’re now up against a growing pool of the world’s best students. The University of Chicago recently set a goal for international enrollment of 15 percent. The foreign share of its freshmen in 2014 was 11 percent, up from 9 percent in 2004. The university’s admission rate plunged in that time, federal data shows, from 40 percent to 9 percent.    The entrance to the University of Chicago quadrangle, in a file photo from 2007.   “To me it would be peculiar  —   given the evolution of problems in the world, the challenges the world faces, and the flow of ideas and capital and everything else  —   if we didn’t have a much more global perspective embedded within the university,” said University of Chicago President Robert Zimmer.  International students are often stereotyped as rich kids from abroad who can pay full freight. Many are wealthy. But enrollment officers at prominent schools deny that foreign recruiting is all about money. “For us, it was really philosophical,” said Katharine Harrington, vice president of admissions and planning for the University of Southern California, where 18 percent of freshmen in 2014 were international, up from 7 percent in 2004. “If this is truly a national and global university, we really do believe the undergraduate population ought to better mirror the world in which our students are going to live and work and make their way. ”  USC’s admission rate fell in that decade from 27 percent to 18 percent. At Emory University, the international share of freshmen tripled over a decade, to 17 percent in 2014. John Latting, Emory’s dean of admission, said the growth reflected a spike in international applications. Fifteen years ago, he said, South Korea was big. Then China emerged. “Now we see India, big time,” he said, with that country supplying 44 freshmen this year in a class of about 1, 360. That’s equal to the number from Maryland. Emory also has become more selective, this year admitting 25 percent of applicants. In 2004, it admitted 42 percent. “Sure, it’s tougher,” Latting said. “It’s tougher for everybody  —   international and domestic  —   to get in. ” The admission rate for international students, he said, is about half the rate for domestic students. At Claremont McKenna, where international enrollment has soared, the school lets in about 1 in 10 applicants. In 2004, more than 1 in 5 were accepted. But Jefferson Huang, vice president for admission and financial aid, said foreign and domestic applicants are accepted in almost equal proportion. “If we wiped out the international student population  —   which would be a horrible, horrible thing to do  —   our domestic student population would still have a frighteningly low admit rate,” Huang said. Huang said the college draws huge interest from Pacific Rim countries because of its location in Southern California, home to vibrant Japanese, Korean and Vietnamese immigrant communities. Globalization is central to the college’s appeal, he said.: “Part of the reason domestic students want to come is because of what we’ve done here. ”  At Yale, U. S. students say contact with international peers is invaluable. Zunaira Arshad, 21, a senior from Illinois, said conversations with classmates from Syria and Turkey enriched her perspective on the Syrian crisis. “I’ve learned to empathize and care about people and think about other people besides myself,” she said. “There needs to be more of that. Please, don’t let it be less. ”    Zunaira Arshad, a senior from Hawthorne Woods, Ill. is pursuing a double major in global affairs and molecular, cellular and developmental biology at Yale University. She says contact with international peers is invaluable. (Stan   The Washington Post)  Yale’s push to globalize accelerated after the school celebrated its tricentennial in 2001. The university is one of a few to say that it considers all applications, domestic and foreign, without regard to financial need and meets full need for all who enroll.  “A big advantage for us from a marketing perspective,” said Dean of Admissions Jeremiah Quinlan. Several international students said they applied to Yale because of that policy. The full price of tuition, fees, room and board exceeds $65, 000 a year. That doesn’t include plane tickets and other expenses. “Their financial aid package was the best,” said Camila Franco, 21, a junior from Buenos Aires majoring in biomedical engineering. “I feel in cred ibly lucky to be here. ”   She said she chose Yale after applying to 11 U. S. schools, drawn to the university’s global atmosphere.    “My roommate is from Burma,” she said. “It has definitely opened up my mind. ”  The university receives about 5, 000 international and 26, 000 domestic applications a year. Foreigners are admitted at a lower rate, Quinlan said. Quinlan said he is elated to be able to offer admission to between 300 and 400 more students next year as the university prepares to open the new residential colleges. “I might be the happiest man on campus,” he said. “Now we will be able to open up increased spots for students from all over the world. ”       political science major Elias Mastakouris of Long Island replants American flags that had blown over in front of Sterling Library at Yale University on Veterans Day.

142378,217833,Donald Trump is holding a government casting call. He’s seeking ‘the look.’,Washington Post,Philip Rucker,2016-12-21,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161222013856/https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/donald-trump-is-holding-a-government-casting-call-hes-seeking-the-look/2016/12/21/703ae8a4-c795-11e6-bf4b-2c064d32a4bf_story.html
","      Donald Trump believes that those who aspire to the most visible spots in his administration should not just be able to do the job, but also look the part. Given Trump’s own background as a master brander and showman who ran beauty pageants as a sideline, it was probably inevitable that he would be looking beyond their résumés for a certain aesthetic in his supporting players.  “Presentation is very important because you’re representing America not only on the national stage but also the international stage, depending on the position,” said Trump transition spokesman Jason Miller. To lead the Pentagon, Trump chose a rugged combat general, whom he compares to a historic one. At the United Nations, his ambassador will be a poised and elegant Indian American with a compelling immigrant backstory. As secretary of state, Trump tapped a neophyte to international diplomacy, but one whose silvery hair and boardroom bearing project authority. The parade of potential   passing a bank of media cameras to board the elevators at Trump Tower has the feel of a casting call. It is no coincidence that a disproportionate share of the names most mentioned for jobs at the upper echelon of the Trump administration are familiar faces to obsessive viewers of cable news  —   of whom the   is one.  “He likes people who present themselves very well, and he’s very impressed when somebody has a background of being good on television because he thinks it’s a very important medium for public policy,” said Chris Ruddy, chief executive of Newsmax Media and a longtime friend of Trump. “Don’t forget, he’s a showbiz guy. He was at the pinnacle of showbiz, and he thinks about showbiz. He sees this as a business that relates to the public. ” “The look might not necessarily be somebody who should be on the cover of GQ magazine or Vanity Fair,” Ruddy said. “It’s more about the look and the demeanor and the swagger. ” As Trump formally announced his vice presidential pick in July, he said that Mike Pence’s economic record as Indiana governor was “the primary reason I wanted Mike, other than he looks very good, other than he’s got an incredible family, incredible wife and family. ”  And in picking retired Marine Gen. James Mattis as his nominee for defense, Trump lauded him as “the closest thing to General George Patton that we have. ”  Mattis has a passing physical resemblance to the legendary World War II commander, as well as to the late actor George C. Scott, who won an Academy Award for his portrayal of Patton in the 1970 biopic. Trump also seems particularly enamored with a nickname that Mattis is said to privately dislike. “You know he’s known as ‘Mad Dog’ Mattis, right? ‘Mad Dog’ for a reason,” Trump said in a recent interview with the New York Times.       (Jenny   Washington Post)   The   however, does not mention Mattis’ other sobriquet, which is “Warrior Monk. ” Or his call sign: “Chaos. ” On the other hand, in Trump’s book, not having the right kind of appearance is tantamount to a disqualifier. During the presidential campaign, he stirred a controversy when he pronounced that Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton lacked “a presidential look, and you need a presidential look. ”  Battling through the GOP primary, Trump frequently made barbed comments about his opponents’ appearances.  Those kind of   standards helped make Trump a success as a   star and international brand, but his critics say they are worrisome in the Oval Office.  His personnel choices show signs of being “cast for the TV show of his administration,” said Bob Killian, founder of a branding agency based in Chicago. “They are all perfectly coifed people who look like they belong on a set. ” But Trump spokesman Miller insisted that some qualifications do not lend themselves to lines on a résumé: “People who are being selected for these key positions need to be able to hold their own, need to be doers and not wallflowers, and need to convey a clear sense of purpose and commitment. ”      (Thomas   Washington Post)   All of which has led him to some unconventional picks. If confirmed by the Senate, ExxonMobil chief executive Rex Tillerson will become the first secretary of state in modern history to come to the job with no experience in government. Then again, Trump himself has none. South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley (R) has little obvious foreign policy experience to qualify her for United Nations ambassador, but she is a rising political star who brings diversity to Trump’s largely white and male picks for top jobs. Given how she and the   had clashed during the 2016 campaign, Haley’s selection also suggests that Trump is willing to bring adversaries into the fold when they suit his needs.  In hiring, Trump has long trusted his own impressions, at times more than a candidate’s expertise or experience.  In 1981, he saw a security guard at the U. S. Open tennis championships masterfully eject some hecklers. Trump asked Barbara Res, one of his top construction executives, to hire the man.  “But you’ve never even met him!” she protested. Trump said he liked how the man looked when he handled the situation. That security guard, Matthew Calamari, has worked for Trump for 35 years and is now chief operating officer of Trump Properties. His son, Matthew Calamari Jr. started with Trump five years ago as a security guard and is now the Trump Organization’s director of surveillance. Trump’s closest aides have come to accept that he is likely to rule out candidates if they are not attractive or not do not match his image of the type of person who should hold a certain job. “That’s the language he speaks. He’s very aesthetic,” said one person familiar with the transition team’s internal deliberations who spoke on the condition of anonymity. “You can come with somebody who is very much qualified for the job, but if they don’t look the part, they’re not going anywhere. ”     John R. Bolton, former U. S. ambassador to the United Nations, at the elevator at Trump Tower on Dec. 2 (Justin   News)  Several of Trump’s associates said they thought that John R. Bolton’s   mustache was one of the factors that handicapped the bombastic former United Nations ambassador in the sweepstakes for secretary of state. “Donald was not going to like that mustache,” said one associate, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to speak frankly. “I can’t think of anyone that’s really close to Donald that has a beard that he likes. ” Trump was drawn to Tillerson and 2012 GOP nominee Mitt Romney for secretary of state because of their presence and the way they command a room when they walk in.    Rex Tillerson (left) and Mitt Romney with Donald Trump (Washington Post illustration using images from Getty, Reuters and iStock)  The   considered Romney despite the former Massachusetts governor’s scathing criticism of him during the presidential campaign. Several Trump associates say he was drawn to Romney, and later to Tillerson, by their “central casting” quality, a phrase the   uses frequently in his private deliberations. People close to Trump said he has been eager to appoint a telegenic woman as press secretary or in some other   role in his White House  —   both because he thinks it would attract viewers and would help inoculate him from the charges of sexism that trailed his presidential campaign.     Clockwise from top left: Kellyanne Conway, Kimberly Guilfoyle, Laura Ingraham and Monica Crowley (Washington Post illustration using images from Getty, Reuters and iStock)  His first choice was his campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, who has resisted the offer. Others under consideration included Laura Ingraham, Kimberly Guilfoyle and Monica Crowley, all of whom are conservative pundits familiar to the viewers of Fox News Channel. The current favorite for press secretary is Republican National Committee chief strategist and communications director Sean Spicer, who has impressed Trump with his tough and unyielding defenses of the incoming administration in hostile interviews on cable news networks. Crowley, meanwhile, has been picked to become communications chief for Trump’s National Security Council, where the deputy director will be K. T. McFarland, another longtime denizen of the Fox green room. Trump is also said to be considering CNBC commentator Larry Kudlow for head of his Council of Economic Advisers. That is normally an    spot given to a prestigious economist, but Kudlow has neither an undergraduate nor graduate degree in the subject.  Kudlow is, however, known for his ardent advocacy of tax cuts, which are also a top priority for the incoming president. In Trump’s administration, the job description may be to formulate his policies  —   and also help sell them on TV.

","           Donald Trump on Wednesday appeared to stand by his plans to establish a registry for Muslims and temporarily ban Muslim immigrants from the United States. Speaking outside his    resort in Florida, Trump did not walk back the proposals after he was asked by a reporter whether he was rethinking or reevaluating them in the wake of a fresh terrorist attack in Berlin. “You know my plans,” Trump said. He went on to add that the attack on a Berlin Christmas market, which was claimed by the Islamic State, had vindicated him. German authorities are seeking a    Tunisian migrant, who they say has ties to Islamist extremists, in connection with the attack, which killed 12 people and injured dozens. “All along, I’ve been proven to be right.    correct,” Trump said. “What’s happening is disgraceful. ”  Trump has long called for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States and has expressed openness to a registry of Muslims already in the country. A year ago, in a statement, Trump said he wanted a “total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country’s representatives can figure out what is going on. ” The proposal was sharply criticized by Republicans and Democrats alike. And later, Trump’s senior aides and surrogates sought to soften the proposal, suggesting that Trump would support a ban on immigration only from countries that had been ”compromised by terrorism.” But given an opportunity on Wednesday to clarify his remarks, Trump suggested that his plans stood as he had articulated them early in his campaign. The statement proposing a “complete” shutdown of Muslim immigration remains on Trump’s website. And Trump has not clarified how exactly he would address the issue as president. The issue is the source of anxiety for Muslims and advocates across the country. “I think that at this point, we don’t quite know what he means when he says Muslim ban,” said Faiza Patel, who   the liberty and national security program at the Brennan Center for Justice at NYU’s Law school. “A lot of people have interpreted that as he intends to revive the NSEERS system, which was made   a few years ago,” she added, referring to the registry system developed by current Trump adviser Kris Kobach, which civil rights groups and security experts said unfairly targeted Muslims and provided few security benefits. Jaime “Mujahid” Fletcher, who founded IslamInSpanish, a center for Muslim Latinos in Houston, said the issue of a registry came up last week when he and other area Muslim leaders met with FBI agents in Houston. “We met with the head of the FBI in their office,” Fletcher said. “It was all about this new administration coming in: what can we expect from them? Is this going to be a change in the way they approach our community?” He said the meeting was reassuring. Muslim leaders said they felt that a registry would take America backward and the FBI seemed to agree. “They didn’t foresee us going back to the past. They were reassuring. This is the way they see it,” Fletcher said. It was good to hear, but area Muslims are still concerned, he said. “Obviously the community feels there are orders and commands from higher up and if those are sent down to a local level, will they act? And how much of what they think now could change in the future?” In response to other questions from reporters outside    Trump said that he had last spoken to President Obama two days ago.        Donald Trump called the attack in Berlin on a Christmas market an attack against ”humanity.” A Tunisian man who is still at large is suspected of carrying out the attack, which killed 12 and injured dozens more. (Reuters)   He was also asked about his characterization of the Berlin attack as an attack on Christians. “ISIS and other Islamist terrorists continually slaughter Christians in their communities and places of worship as part of their global jihad,” Trump had said in a statement issued after the attack on Monday. On Wednesday, Trump appeared unfamiliar with the statement issued in his name. “Who said that?” Trump countered, challenging the reporter. “It’s an attack on humanity. That’s what it is. An attack on humanity, and it’s got to be stopped. ”"

"," Some things Donald Trump says enrage me, while others get under my skin. The pronouncement that does both is his regular claim that until he prevailed, Americans were not free to say “merry Christmas” to each other. He was at it again last week in West Allis, Wis. during his       Victory Tour. Trump declared: “So when I started 18 months ago, I told my first crowd in Wisconsin that we are going to come back here someday and we are going to say merry Christmas again. Merry Christmas. So, merry Christmas everyone. ”  Here’s what bothers me: Long before Trump came along we were entirely free to say “merry Christmas” to each other. Our political leaders could say it, too.  On her MSNBC program last weekend, my friend Joy Reid demonstrated that President Obama was no   guy trying to hide remembrances of the birth of Jesus Christ behind some noxious wall of secularism. She showed not one but 20 moments when the president said the words “merry Christmas. ”  As for me, I’ve never felt the least reluctant to say “merry Christmas”  —   as long as I know the person I’m talking to is a Christian who observes the holiday.      (McKenna Ewen, Whitney Shefte, Dalton   Washington Post)   And there’s the rub. We all know that Trump has simply picked up the “war on Christmas” theme driven annually by conservative media. Like so much else these days, this “issue” divides us along partisan lines. A PRRI survey released this week found that Republicans, by more than 2 to 1, want stores and businesses to greet customers with “Merry Christmas. ” Democrats, by a similar margin, prefer them to say “Happy holidays. ” The political commotion around Christmas is partly a response to litigation over what religious freedom demands when it comes to governments setting up displays in public places at this time of year. There are legitimate and heartfelt differences of opinion over what the First Amendment tells us about this. But as is his way, Trump sidesteps all the complexities. He reduces everything to whether or not we can say “merry Christmas” and folds this into his attack on “political correctness. ” The political correctness police are instantly transformed into a phalanx of heathen Scrooges and Grinches. It doesn’t stop Trump that “happy holidays” is popular among retailers not because some Big Brother liberals (let alone government) are telling them to say it. They simply want to sell to a broad group of consumers, many of whom aren’t Christian. If Trump wanted to criticize the commercialization of Christmas, he might start an interesting conversation. But a man who sells his brand for a living probably doesn’t want to go there. What Trump is demeaning is the simple decency that lies behind the decision to avoid saying “merry Christmas” to  . I learned about this not from secular liberals, but from my very devotedly Catholic (and Republican) parents. We lived in the most Jewish neighborhood of our overwhelmingly Catholic town. The idea that you can be, simultaneously, part of a majority and a minority is a common experience in our open and religiously diverse society. My parents taught my sister and me back in the 1950s, long before anyone had heard of “political correctness,” that we should respect our Jewish friends and neighbors by saying “happy holidays” or “happy Hanukkah. ” We proudly celebrated Christmas and were one of the few houses on our block with Christmas lights. But we also wanted to honor the religious commitments of our Jewish friends and neighbors, just as they honored ours.  It was a way of taking everyone’s religion very seriously. My late mom had many conversations over tea and coffee about the nature of God with Emma Dondis, our   neighbor. Mrs. Dondis, as we called her, was a devout Jew who cared a great deal about faith, what it meant and what it required. (I also liked her because she and her son Eli always let us use their basketball hoop.)  As it happens, I love Christmas and started writing this column as we were setting up our tree and the manger recalling the place where a Savior was born when there was no room at the inn. To all who honor Christmas, may this one be very merry. And in a season of peace and good will to all, may Donald Trump enjoy a moment of serene tranquility and reflection. Since he does not strike me or most others as particularly religious, I will err on the cautious side and wish him the very happiest of holidays.   Read more from E. J.

142381,217836,James Comey’s year of unintended — and ruinous — consequences,Washington Post,Dana Milbank,2016-12-21,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161222013856/https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/james-comeys-year-of-unintended--and-ruinous--consequences/2016/12/21/459cb0de-c7bb-11e6-8bee-54e800ef2a63_story.html
"," What a year it has been for James Comey! At the start of 2016, the FBI director enjoyed a reputation as a public servant of high integrity, earning bipartisan acclaim for his stewardship of the nation’s preeminent law enforcement agency. A year later, the FBI, after a series of blows to its credibility, seems increasingly partisan. Comey has shown himself to be an inconsistent leader. And an ugly conclusion is becoming difficult to escape: He singlehandedly caused Donald Trump to win the presidency. Doubt on that last point should have been dispelled this week, after court documents were released Tuesday that showed the justification for Comey’s decision  —   announced to the nation just 11 days before the election  —   that he was reopening his investigation into Hillary Clinton’s emails. We now know Comey’s bombshell was based on nothing: The FBI had no evidence of wrongdoing in the newly discovered emails, found on Huma Abedin’s laptop, and no reason to suspect there was anything on the laptop that the FBI hadn’t already dismissed as insufficient to mount a prosecution. Yet that was the flimsy basis for Comey’s letter to Congress reopening the Clinton probe. The new emails were irrelevant or redundant. But by the time Comey said, just two days before the election, that the FBI found nothing new, the damage to Clinton was done.      (Reuters)   When an election is this close  —   Clinton, in the final tally, won the popular vote by 2. 8 million votes  —   any number of factors could have shifted the outcome: Russia’s hacking, Jill Stein’s Green Party candidacy, Clinton’s weaknesses as a candidate, her   message of continuity in times that demanded populist change. But Comey’s intervention is one thing that almost certainly changed the result. Nationwide, voters who decided in the last week  —   the time when Comey’s announcement dominated the news  —   overwhelmingly went for Trump.   went for Trump by 17 points in Florida and Pennsylvania, by 11 points in Michigan and 29 points in Wisconsin. I doubt Comey meant to give the presidency to Trump. All along, I maintained that he was a man of integrity. But he demonstrated poor judgment. So protective was he of his    reputation that his attempts to guard it caused a series of bad decisions. Ironically, his attempts at preserving his reputation were what hurt him. In June, before Comey’s July statement on the Clinton email issue, 48 percent of Americans expressed confidence in the FBI and 16 percent lacked confidence, according to an   Street Journal poll. Now, six months later, 37 percent have confidence in the FBI, while 27 percent don’t  —   and Republicans and Democrats are almost identical in their views. Comey’s trouble began with his announcement, on the eve of the national political conventions, that no reasonable prosecutor would bring charges against Clinton over the emails. His   recommendation infuriated congressional Republicans. This criticism must have stung, since Comey, a former George W. Bush administration official, then took a series of actions that seemed designed to repair his reputation with Republicans. First, he refused to join an administration statement on Oct. 7 naming Russia as the perpetrator of hacks of American political organizations. He reasoned that the FBI shouldn’t be seen as injecting itself into politics so close to an election. Comey made a mockery of such considerations when he delivered his October Surprise later that month, defying warnings from the Justice Department and ignoring   guidelines by announcing that he was reopening the Clinton probe. It probably wasn’t done to torpedo Clinton, though that was the result. The most convincing explanation: Comey feared that already irate congressional Republicans, if they were to learn that he didn’t disclose the new discovery of Clinton emails, would have trashed his integrity. And Republicans were certain to find out. The Trump campaign’s Rudy Giuliani, the recipient of leaks apparently originating with   agents in the FBI’s New York office, had already signaled that big news was about to break. Since the election, Comey has continued to protect his reputation  —   at considerable cost. Earlier this month, news broke that the CIA had concluded Russia intervened in the election to help Trump. But FBI officials resisted joining the conclusion. Perhaps Comey was again trying to keep his agency and himself above the fray, but the FBI’s mush helped Trump dismiss the CIA’s findings. The matter turned into a partisan fight rather than the   concern it should be. After several days, and the intervention of the director of national intelligence, Comey finally acknowledged the obvious: that the FBI, too, believes the Russians tried to help Trump. Did Comey mean to become Trump’s elector, and now his protector? Probably not. But in the end, motives count for less than outcomes. And Comey’s have been ruinous.

","  “To change anything in the Navy is like punching a feather bed. You punch it with your right and you punch it with your left until you are finally exhausted, and then you find the damn bed just as it was before you started punching. ”    —   Franklin Roosevelt, 1940     SAN DIEGO  What the former assistant secretary of the Navy said is descriptive of the entire military. Each service’s culture, and interservice rivalries, and bureaucratic viscosity are resistant to reform. Which is why the next secretary of defense, retired Marine Corps Gen. James N. Mattis, has the most difficult management challenge in American government.  He comes from a service whose core mission,   combat, involves conflict at its most granular. He will now rely on companies such as General Atomics here, whose business is leveraging technology to produce maximum potential military lethality with minimal costs. The   ardently advocated substantially increased defense spending, and just as ardently favors unrestrained entitlement spending. For about $500, 000 in expenditures, the   attackers did more than $2 trillion in damage to the United States and the world economy. The linked physical and cyber infrastructures of complex societies are vulnerable to such asymmetries. General Atomics’ scientists toil to redress this imbalance with, for example, the Predator and other remotely piloted aircraft (RPAs).  But they bristle at the word “drone,” which they think falsely suggests mindlessness on the part of aircraft that perform three “ISR” missions  —   intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance. RPAs can hover for 40 hours over a Middle East target and deliver, with Hellfire missiles, a munitions payload equal to an  ’s. The “fast movers”  —     and the like  —   must refuel coming and going from the Persian Gulf, and most have returned to their aircraft carriers without expending their ordnance. A Reaper, another type of RPA, can deliver what an   the most expensive fighter aircraft, can. The Reaper is only half as fast, but is speed  —   aviation’s expensive goal since World War II  —   so important? An increasing amount of the Reaper’s and the  ’s work, including sensing and jamming, is done at the speed of light, which is roughly 560, 000 times faster than the  ’s airspeed. RPAs, which have logged more than 4 million flight hours looking, listening and attacking, can discover what the enemy is planning and doing, and can deliver precision strikes with minimal collateral damage. They could have been an inexpensive and   way of intervening in Syria by enforcing a     zone that would have protected President Bashar  ’s enemies and victims.  But because RPAs are unmanned, they clash with important components of the military culture. Marine jets from Air Station Miramar roar over General Atomics, making what has been called “the sound of freedom,” but some scientists here call it the sound of obsolescence.  The Navy is using   electromagnetic energy to replace steam catapults to launch   aircraft off carriers with less stress on the planes, and hence lower maintenance expenses. Now the Navy is acquiring rail guns that use such energy to fire   to     projectiles at 5, 000 miles per hour. They hit with the impact of a train slamming into a wall at 100 miles per hour. The   hence   projectiles, which cost just $25, 000, can radically improve   capabilities: A barrage of them could counter an enemy’s more expensive   missiles.  The daunting challenge posed by defense against the proliferating threat of ballistic missiles is that it is prohibitively expensive to be prepared to intercept a swarm of incoming missiles. New technologies, however, can revolutionize defense against ballistic missiles because small, smart projectiles can be inexpensive. It takes 300 seconds to pick up such a launched missile’s signature, the missile must be tracked and a vector calculated for defensive projectiles. A single   projectile can dispense more than 500   tungsten impactors and be fired at hypervelocity by electromagnetic energy. Their impact force  —   their mass times the square of their velocity  —   can destroy expensive missiles and multiple warheads.  Mattis will be trying to take control of the often uncontrollable Pentagon, with its interservice rivalries and intricate problems of matching slowly developed weapons to rapidly metastasizing threats. The good news, such as it is, is this:  The nation just experienced a raucous presidential campaign during which there was silence about the crisis of the entitlement state  —   an aging population’s pension and   entitlements swallowing government resources, with alarming national security implications. But technology, pursued determinedly, has the potential to make peace through making deterrent strength less expensive.  Read more from George F. Will’s archive or follow him on Facebook.

142383,217838,Germans face a new threat — and their democracy faces a test,Washington Post,Editorial Board,2016-12-21,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161222013856/https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/germans-face-a-new-threat--and-their-democracy-faces-a-test/2016/12/21/7b670d6c-c79e-11e6-85b5-76616a33048d_story.html
"," THROUGHOUT HISTORY, violent, authoritarian movements have tried to exploit the freedom, openness and diversity of democratic societies for undemocratic purposes, turning their most cherished strengths into potentially mortal vulnerabilities. If any country understands this, it is Germany, where National Socialists first destabilized the Weimar Republic through demonstrations and propaganda and then took it over via the ballot box. During the Cold War,    terrorist groups shook West Germany to its core  —   before effective law enforcement, their own blunders and, crucially, repudiation by mainstream citizens ultimately defeated them. In the wake of Monday’s murderous attack on a Christmas market in Berlin, which left 12 innocent people dead, Germans, amid their necessary and justified mourning, must face the fact that they once again face such a threat. The threat is new and modern, in the sense that it apparently comes from the same Islamist extremist terrorist movement that has already claimed too many lives in the United States, Europe and around the world. The Islamic State took responsibility for the massacre, and the prime suspect is a Tunisian man whose application for asylum in Germany was recently rejected due to his alleged terrorism links. Yet this violent threat is fundamentally similar to those of the past, in that it can succeed only if it induces democracy to fail.   The question, then, for all Germans, starting with Chancellor Angela Merkel, is how to make sure today’s terrorists meet the same defeat that the Red Army Faction met during the 1970s. The first step, as Ms. Merkel had begun to recognize already in response to previous violent incidents, is to address the weaknesses of her   policy toward asylum seekers from the Middle East and elsewhere. This brought more than a million newcomers to the country last year amid abundant, almost giddy voluntary aid from many Germans  —   before the mood soured amid organizational chaos and   criminal acts by some newcomers.  Ms. Merkel’s response to the refugee crisis was admirable, but sustainability, especially political sustainability, of the policy must now be the objective. That means better, swifter screening of migrants, better integration of those who qualify to stay as refugees and the removal of those who lack an authentic asylum claim. Germany may need a more general attitude adjustment toward security; due to privacy concerns, for example, it has been slower than the United States and United Kingdom to adopt video surveillance of public spaces.  What Germans cannot and must not do is permit terrorists to sow internal division, much less succumb to the siren song of the   right wing, which has been gaining strength across Europe and moved immediately to exploit the attack ahead of the September 2017 national elections. To be sure, striking these balances will be more difficult for Ms. Merkel and her people in a world where Donald Trump has ridden   demagoguery to the presidency of Germany’s most powerful ally. Unavoidably, though, the burden of proving that democratic values are not only consistent with society’s safety but also, in the long run, its best guarantee now belongs to the chancellor. She must bear it, no matter how lonely that job may sometimes feel.

Not this time.",Washington Post,Charles Lane,2016-12-21,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161222013856/https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/republicans-always-do-what-the-koch-brothers-tell-them-right-not-this-time/2016/12/21/0667d66c-c7a9-11e6-85b5-76616a33048d_story.html
"," In this uncertain world, there are still a few unalterable facts of political life. For example, Republicans always do what Charles and David Koch, the billionaire bankrollers of   politics nationwide, tell them.  Then again, maybe not. As it happens, the Koch brothers are dead set against the House Republicans’ business tax reform plan, yet GOP leaders are pushing it anyway. At issue is the proposed   cash flow tax (DBCFT) which despite its   name is anything but a tepid idea. To the contrary, it could affect   business models across Corporate America. Here’s the plan: Instead of today’s corporate tax, which charges rates up to 35 percent on worldwide income, adjusted for deductions and loopholes, the DBCFT would impose a flat 20 percent tax only on earnings from sales of output consumed within the United States (with an immediate   on capital investment and no deduction for net interest).  It gets complicated, but the upshot is that the cost of imported supplies would no longer be deductible from taxable income, while all revenue from exports would be.  This would be a huge incentive to import less and export more, significant change indeed for an economy deeply dependent on global supply chains, and which routinely runs an overall merchandise trade deficit.  Meanwhile, the plan would discourage companies from shifting earnings to subsidiaries in   countries and encourage American and foreign companies to operate within the United States.  Authors of the plan like the increased taxation of imports  —   “border adjustment” in   argot  —   not only because of these new incentives, but also because, without border adjustment, the huge cut in the top rate would blow up the deficit. Indeed, the plan would cost $1. 2 trillion more over 10 years but for border adjustment, according to an analysis by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center.  Et voila: finally a system of corporate taxation that raises revenue efficiently, discourages debt and promotes capital investment right here in the USA. Yes, in the short run, there would be winners  —   agricultural exporters, say  —   and losers  —   big retailers of imported consumer goods such as Walmart.  Overall, however, firms and consumers alike would be no worse off, advocates say: That’s because the dollar would eventually strengthen in response to   changes in the flow of trade, offsetting higher   costs of imports and depriving exporters of any unearned windfall. So what’s the Koch brothers’ beef? Their   is a bit obscure: Koch Industries is privately held, and its financial data are not publicly disclosed. Still, the conglomerate is quite obviously a major player in chemicals and petroleum refining, sectors that import nearly half of their supplies and thus could take a   hit from the GOP tax plan, according to a JPMorgan Asset Management study. Publicly, however, the Kochs maintain they would “greatly benefit,” as a recent statement from their top lobbyist put it. Their worry is that the plan “will distort the market, increase consumer prices and create an uneven playing field for companies and consumers,” with “devastating”   economic consequences. Koch Industries has funded a report by the Brattle Group, an economic consulting firm, arguing that border adjustment would drive up gasoline and diesel prices.  They have a point, in the sense that the GOP plan depends on a lot of variables  —   dollar appreciation chief among them  —   that might not pan out under   conditions.  As the JPMorgan study notes, the greenback would have to rise 25 percent to offset what would be a new 20 percent tax on imported inputs  —   propelling the U. S. currency to its highest level on record.  The international consequences of that are unforeseeable, but unlikely to be totally benign for everyone. Bear in mind that many other countries  —   China comes to mind  —   can and will manipulate exchange rates to protect their own   interests.  Trading partners could also challenge the GOP plan as a discriminatory subsidy at the World Trade Organization. That’s because it includes a deduction for wages paid by U. S.  firms, importers and exporters alike  —   a break that would obviously not be available to competitors abroad. Neither   Donald Trump nor   in the Republican Senate have embraced the House GOP plan yet; it may never come to fruition, in which case the surprising little debate between the Kochs and their presumed flunkies will have been academic.  Still, the tiff is interesting as a case study of internal GOP politics  —   and of the U. S. economy’s “path dependency. ”  Theoretically free to reinvent our national business model, we are actually constrained by countless accumulated policy decisions of the past and all the accumulated investments and other commitments that were made in reliance on them. Change is scary, even for the richest men in the world.  Read more from Charles Lane’s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook.

"," IN MAY 1988, when Vice President George H. W. Bush was running for president, he was appalled to read in the newspapers that a lawyer claiming to have influence with him had been hired by a New York defense contractor. The vice president wrote a letter to his son George, published by the New York Times, admonishing him to beware of newfound friends who will “ask for things” and reminding him to avoid any sign of impropriety. The family of   Donald Trump would be wise to absorb the letter and spirit of Mr. Bush’s message. In recent weeks, three of Mr. Trump’s grown children, who play a prominent role in his business and political affairs, have been toying with dubious fundraising events that could be a channel for  . Mr. Trump should lay down the law hard and fast: No one can use his family as a shortcut to   business. Family members have often been ethical burdens for presidents  —   the problem did not begin yesterday. But Mr. Trump seems to be especially vulnerable as he moves from private life to public service. He has done little to draw clear lines: His tax returns are still not public, and he has yet to disclose how he plans to avoid conflicts of interest once in office. His grand     philosophy may have been wonderful in real estate, but in public life he will be held to a high standard: to avoid impropriety and the appearance of impropriety. In order to satisfy that and retain public trust, he cannot leave the back door of the White House ajar for influence peddlers. Two recent episodes involving the Trump family are worrisome. The first was an auction offering a coffee with Ivanka Trump, the  ’s daughter, for contributions that would go to the Eric Trump Foundation, run by Ms. Trump’s younger brother, to benefit St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital in Tennessee. The auction essentially advertised access for money, a real temptation to impropriety, regardless of the merit of the charity. Wisely, after being online for 10 days, the auction was called off Dec. 16. Then it was disclosed that a recently formed conservation charity was luring donors with promises of access to the president at an event in Washington on the day after the inauguration as well as a multiday hunting or fishing trip with his oldest sons, Donald Jr. and Eric, in exchange for half a million dollars or more for the charity. On Tuesday, the family issued a statement saying the event had “not been approved or pursued” by them, but reports suggest it was the brainchild of two Dallas friends of the Trump sons. They have decided not to attend. If these missteps are a sign of inexperience, the Trumps must learn quickly. Mr. Bush warned his son in 1988 that they would face a lot of “microscopic probing. ” The Trumps are now in that realm and ought to embrace the ironclad rule that in public service, access and influence are not for sale.

","      More Americans have signed up to have health plans through the Affordable Care Act as of Jan. 1 than in previous years, despite spiking insurance prices and a pledge by   Donald Trump to dismantle the law. Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell announced on Wednesday that 6. 4 million people had chosen Affordable Care Act health plans by the deadline this week for coverage starting New Year’s Day  —   an increase of 400, 000 from a year ago, though fewer   customers enrolled. Yet, as Burwell said the figures signify that “doomsday predictions about the marketplace are not bearing out,” Obama administration officials and health policy researchers who support the law have been taking precautions before Trump takes office. Since shortly after last month’s election, think tank and university researchers have been downloading Affordable Care Act data, reports and regulatory guidance housed online at HHS  —   in case the new administration removes them as part of its efforts to wipe out the law. At a Nov. 30 gathering of health policy researchers at the Urban Institute in Washington, Jeanne Lambrew, a domestic policy adviser to President Obama for health reform, encouraged participants to save the material while they still had access to it, according to a researcher who was present. “It wasn’t, ‘Strike the panic button,’ ” said the researcher, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the meeting was confidential. “She did mention, “Oh, if you guys aren’t downloading documents and data, you probably should be.’ ”  The safeguarding of   records, first reported by Politico, coincides with an archiving campaign underway by environmental researchers who are trying to ensure that government climate measurements are not erased by the incoming administration. Trump’s Cabinet appointees include several figures who dispute the scientific consensus around global warming. According to several health policy researchers working to preserve Affordable Care Act records, the material includes raw data on enrollment and insurance benefits prices, analyses by HHS’s research arm and myriad interpretations the department has issued over the past six years about how the law should be carried out. “I asked my team to go back and make sure we had saved copies of everything we use regularly on our servers, instead of relying on web links,” said Caroline Pearson, a senior vice president at Avalere Health, a D. C.  consulting firm. “If we believe that the ACA is going to be repealed and the exchanges aren’t going to have the political favor they do now, it seems likely that the data about the exchanges could be taken down. ” In the current administration’s final weeks, another researcher said, HHS officials are also trying to hasten the release of previously undisclosed health data. White House spokeswoman Katie Hill declined to comment on officials’ interest in preserving information. In releasing the latest Affordable Care Act   figures, Burwell predicted that enrollment is on pace to reach the 13. 8 million that HHS projected for this fourth   season in the insurance marketplaces created through the law.  The 6. 4 million includes new and returning customers who have selected coverage in the 39 states that rely on HealthCare. gov, the federal exchange’s website. Those people will need to pay their first premium for their insurance to take effect.       (Jenny   Washington Post)   The number does not include consumers who currently have coverage under the health law and soon will be automatically reenrolled because they have not picked a health plan for 2017. A year ago, HHS automatically enrolled slightly more than 2 million such people, who later were given a chance to keep or turn down that insurance. Larry Levitt, a senior vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation, said Wednesday that, given the latest data, “there are certainly no signs of the marketplace collapsing in response to premium increases and uncertainty over the future of the law. ” The enrollment season began Nov. 1 and is scheduled to end Jan. 31. That means the final   days will take place after Trump becomes president. Asked whether current HHS leaders have provided information to Trump’s transition team to help it finish the enrollment period, Burwell and Andy Slavitt, acting administrator of the department’s Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, sidestepped the question. The agency’s “staff is obviously quite good and quite strong and quite capable,” Slavitt said. “We obviously will do anything asked of us to help the new team. ”  $(function() );  "

","Russia’s popularity among Americans has once again dropped to Cold   depths, according to a new poll from the Chicago Council on Global Affairs released on Wednesday.      The poll found Americans giving Russia an average rating of 32 when asked to rate their feelings toward Russia from 0 to 100. That score is down from an average of 40 in the organization’s June survey, and marks the lowest score on this measure since 1986, when Russia’s rating stood at 31. The survey comes after publication of a CIA assessment that Russia intervened in the 2016 election, in part to help Donald Trump become president. That conclusion was endorsed by the FBI and Director of National Intelligence last week. Trump has said he doesn’t believe the CIA’s findings, calling them “ridiculous” in a Fox News Sunday interview earlier this month. Compared with other countries, Russia continues to be significantly less popular with the American public than its closest neighbors and its largest international rival. Russia’s overall rating 32 is 11 percentage points behind China’s 41 mark, and far behind Mexico’s 55 and Canada’s 76.    Chicago Council poll Dec.   2016  Among the seven countries tested in the Chicago Council poll, only North Korea ranks below Russia at 20. Russia’s current score also ranks above Iran’s average rating of 26 when it was included in the survey. Republicans and Democrats appear to have reacted differently to Russia since the election. Democrats have recoiled most sharply from Russia in the past six months, with their average rating of the nation dropping 12 percentage points since June, from 40 to 28 on the    scale. Republicans’ ratings have hardly budged, from an average rating of 38 this summer to 35 today.     Although Republicans have not mimicked Democrats, the Chicago Council poll contrasts with other polling this month that found Republicans warming toward Russia’s president and the country overall. An   poll found a growing percentage of Republicans rating Vladimir Putin favorably since 2014 (a longer   comparison) and a shrinking share saying Russia is either unfriendly or an enemy than last summer. In the Chicago Council poll, only 15 percent of Republicans rate their feelings toward Russia as positive (between 51 and 100 on a   scale) slightly down from 20 percent in June. Over 6 in 10 Republicans rate Russia below 50 on this scale (63 percent) a number that rises to 70 percent among Democrats. Regardless of skepticism toward Russia, the new poll found large majorities saying they favor cooperation with Russia to end the conflict in Syria (78 percent) limit Iran’s nuclear program (79 percent) and reduce nuclear weapons worldwide (80 percent). Nonetheless, the historically negative marks for Russia suggest the public is deeply skeptical of the country, making the prospect of closer ties under a Trump administration a difficult sell to the broader public. This Chicago Council survey was conducted online Dec.   among a national sample of 1, 005 adults. The sample was drawn through GfK Custom Research’s Knowledge Panel, which was recruited through   sampling methods. Overall results have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points; the error margin is roughly 5. 5 points among   Democrats and Republicans. "

","     The Washington Post has 17 foreign bureaus staffed with correspondents covering war, terrorism,   politics and refugee crises. But it’s often the small moments, the intimate encounters with people at the heart of these stories, that prove the most memorable. We asked our correspondents to reflect on the stories that meant the most to them this year. Here’s what they said:   ’I was on the beach at 4 a. m. each day, binoculars in hand.’ Griff Witte, London bureau chief    A Greek man helps refugees out of the water after the engine of a boat carrying around 50 Syrians fails in August 2015 near Molyvos, on the island of Lesbos, Greece. (Alessandro Penso for The Washington Post)  I visited the Greek island of Lesbos half a dozen times between the summer of 2015 and the spring of 2016. Each time the situation was completely different. On my first visit, as the number of refugee arrivals was just beginning to spike, I was on the beach at 4 a. m. each day, binoculars in hand. On my third day, I saw my first boat  —   a flimsy little dinghy that nearly capsized as its cargo of 49 people careened into shore. The next time I visited, just over a month later, I stepped on the beach and scoured the horizon. There were 10 rafts on the water, each marked by blotches of   orange that transformed into individual men, women and children as the craft drifted closer to shore. Luckily, the surge in refugees had been accompanied by a surge of volunteers from across Europe, all ready to welcome the new arrivals. By the time I came back for this story in March, however, the mood in Europe had shifted. Most of the volunteers were gone, as was the warm welcome. Instead, Europe was threatening to send people back across the sea. Just weeks after this story was written, I watched from shore as authorities did exactly that.    ’There were so many names to write down, so many details of short lives.’ Liz Sly, Beirut bureau chief    Ahmed Khazaal, 12, shows his Barcelona team jersey, left, and the Real Madrid jersey of his brother, Mohaned Khazaal, 10, who was killed by a suicide bomber. (Ahmad Mousa Qasem for The Washington Post)  In April I reported a story that will haunt me for a lifetime. Brief news agency reports had said that an Islamic State suicide bombing at a soccer stadium south of Baghdad had killed around 30 people, some of them children. That was all. Even for Iraq, it was just another bombing. The international news media was consumed at the time by the attack on the Brussels airport, but I decided to go report on the Iraqi bombing. I did not expect what I found. This was not a regular soccer match that had been bombed, but a children’s game, an   tournament in a village. The spectators and the players were children. So were 29 of the 43 dead. The bomber also was a child. In a tiny community, almost every home had lost a son. The weight of the grief was beyond comprehension. In some ways it was the easiest story I have ever reported. The names and photos of the dead boys were emblazoned on a wall beside the spot where they died. No digging was required to find their families. All we had to do was walk among the houses nearby. Parents too stunned to speak served tea. We drank so much tea. There were so many names to write down, so many details of short lives. All of the boys had been passionate about soccer, had dreamed of becoming stars. Later, I had to unscramble which of them had supported Barcelona, which ones Real Madrid. Now, whenever I catch sight of one of those teams playing on the TV, my heart tugs.    ’They were on their way to harvest caterpillar fungus.’ Simon Denyer, Beijing bureau chief    The family of Chu Tsering, 47, pose for a portrait in the surroundings of Xiaosumang Township, on May 31. (Giulia Marchi for The Washington Post)  It was July on the Himalayan plateau. We had just crossed a snowy pass high in the mountains when a family rode past on their motorbike: a father and three children. The man wore a cowboy hat, his children woolly hats or baseball caps, and everyone had a trowel stuffed into their belts and cloaks. They were on their way to harvest caterpillar fungus, a strange hybrid species worth its weight in gold, much in demand in China for its   and aphrodisiac properties. We joined them as they combed the grassy mountain slopes, eyes peeled for the telltale stalks that revealed the presence of this unique Tibetan mushroom, buried just beneath the soil. As the day wore on, we chatted about their lives and their culture. A sacred, snowy mountain dominated the skyline, lines of Tibetans crossed the slopes on the same quest, and, high above us, a herd of yaks grazed, black dots on the high slopes.    ’I wanted to shine a light on the things these women go through.’ Anna Fifield, Tokyo bureau chief    Suh, a    woman, carries her daughter   on her back as they illegally crossed the border from Laos into Thailand at night. (Sin Huh)  This was a   story to write. I spent several days in Vientiane, Laos, with four women who had escaped from North Korea and then escaped again from China, and were on their way to freedom. Hundreds or thousands of women live in the shadows in China, in constant fear of being repatriated to North Korea  —   where they would face harsh punishment. They live in terrible circumstances in the meantime. I wanted to shine a light on the things these women go through and the perilous journey they have to make to escape. But it was personally moving, too. One of the women, Ms. Suh, had an    daughter who was with them. The girl,   didn’t have a single toy. While I was talking to her mom, she drew with my pens and highlighters in one of my notebooks. Afterward, I bought her a soft teddy bear. I’m a mom too, and I couldn’t stand the thought of this little girl not having anything to play with. She was delighted. I was due to meet the women again in Bangkok, but after they crossed the Mekong river into Thailand, they got caught by the police. The mom sent our intermediary photos of them in the prison van and then in the jail  —   and there was   holding the teddy bear.    ’This article reminded me why I got into journalism.’ Michael Birnbaum, Brussels bureau chief    Pollster Lyubov, 47, right, questions Igor, 52, in a corridor of an apartment building on March 2 in Moscow. (Alexander Zemlianichenko Jr. for The Washington Post)  When you live in Russia, you constantly hear about President Vladimir Putin’s approval rating. The Kremlin keeps a close eye on it and does everything possible to keep it  . Some people even argue the concern over the president’s popularity amounts to a crude form of democracy, even if choices don’t happen at the ballot box but instead with pollsters’ questionnaires. So I wanted to see how polling agencies actually did their surveys. One   polling group let me tag along with a pollster on a freezing morning as she knocked on doors across a vast   apartment complex. The verdict? Putin is really popular, even if Russians are worried about the price of groceries and drugs, corrupt local officials and the lack of opportunities for the future. But almost everyone we met held Putin above politics, as though he has transcended workaday concerns and transformed himself into a symbol of the state. For a lot of people, asking whether they liked Putin seemed to be like asking whether they liked Russia itself. Reporting this article reminded me why I got into journalism.    ’This young man could not comprehend that he had come this far only to be turned away.’ Anthony Faiola, Berlin bureau chief    Yazidi asylum seekers from Shengal, Iraq, outside an Ikea house one several news camps that Greece has built over the last three weeks. (Jodi Hilton for The Washington Post)  This is not my most widely read piece this year, and probably not the most impactful. But as a journalist who values giving voice to the voiceless, I felt this story about asylum seekers stuck in Greece because of Europe’s decision to shut its doors captured the high human cost of the policy. Greece’s prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, calls his country a “warehouse of souls” stranded in migrant camps. I most clearly recall a young Afghan economics professor, a    struggling to keep up appearances with his pristine shirt and spotless sweater despite his squalid surroundings. He was gentle, shy and genuinely confused. This young man could not comprehend that he had come this far only to be turned away. He seemed to sincerely fear for his life if he returned to Afghanistan because of his   leanings, which could make him a target in a nation battling Taliban insurgents. We so often write about political decisions on the international stage. I’d like to think this piece managed in some small way to illustrate the toll these decisions can take on the lives of individuals and families.    ’It took months to find the right case.’ Annie Gowen, India bureau chief    A girl from the Northern Indian state of Haryana was one of four whose supporters say they were raped at the order of a panchayat, village council, as punishment to the entire community over a land dispute. (Enrico Fabian for The Washington Post)  I tried for over a year to write about village councils in India that often administer their own brand of vigilante justice outside the criminal justice system. It took months to find the right case. Some people lied. Finally, I found a case where the proof was irrefutable: A local activist had a cellphone video of a village council member beating a teen after learning she had been raped by her father. The council members blamed the young woman for the attack and berated her for not quickly reporting it. It broke my heart when she told us she thought she deserved the beating.    ’His highest duty was to protect his men and his country.’ Loveday Morris, Baghdad bureau chief    Iraqi soldiers fire artillery toward Islamic State positions from a location outside Makhmour, Iraq, on April 18. (Alice Martins for The Washington Post)  I first met Col. Ihab Hashem   back in early 2014, he’d been injured in an Islamic State car bomb and gave a candid critique of the disarray in the Iraqi army at the time. He described in painstaking detail disastrous missions in western Iraq. A few months later the army spectacularly collapsed in Mosul. After that he always seemed to be in the thick of the fighting against Islamic State. I often wondered how he was still alive after so many near misses. I had been planning to talk to him for this story that looked at the progress of the Iraqi armed forces, but Ihab was killed in battles near Fallujah as I was reporting it. His family and colleagues said that before he died he had requested a tank from the Defense Ministry, but had been asked for a $2, 000 bribe to secure it. It was exactly the kind of incident that he’d never shied from highlighting, saying his highest duty was to protect his men and his country.    ’They were amazed at how green Israel looked compared to the parched Gaza Strip.’ William Booth, Jerusalem bureau chief    Faisal and Huda Buhasi rest on a bus after their trip to the mosque. (William   Washington Post)  This was a quiet little story, just a glimpse into the life of the Palestinians who live in the Gaza Strip. But it took us months to set up. We needed to coordinate with the Israeli military, which canceled several trips. My friend, our Gaza stringer and translator, Hazem Balousha, needed permission from Israeli security to enter Israel. He had to coordinate with the Palestinian Authority, too, to get on a bus. Hamas had to at least nod its approval. Once aboard the bus, the elderly Palestinians were warm and forthcoming about what it meant for them to see Jerusalem and Al Aqsa mosque again after so many years. I will always remember how they were amazed at how green Israel looked compared to the parched Gaza Strip.    ’She was candid, articulate and also fascinatingly alien.’ Nick Miroff, Latin America correspondent    Yurluey Mendoza, 33, a FARC guerrilla fighter from the southern bloc, washes in the base camp in the Savannas of Yari during the 10th conference of the FARC in Colombia. (Joao Pina for The Washington Post)  Back in September, I spent a couple days with Yurluey Mendoza, a guerrilla with the leftist FARC movement, who has been fighting in Colombia’s jungles for the past 20 years. She was candid, articulate and also fascinatingly alien, like someone rescued from a desert island. Yurluey made a powerful impression on me, and she was the first person I thought about when Colombian voters rejected their government’s peace deal with the FARC a few weeks after our encounter. Yurluey was looking forward to peace. She was physically and mentally tired of the war, and had multiple injuries and battle scars from her years in combat. I wonder what she would do next, and what she might be thinking. But of course I couldn’t pick up the phone to give her a call. I suppose she’s still in the lurch like everyone in Colombia now. The government has salvaged its peace deal with the FARC by winning approval in Colombia’s congress. But for now Yurluey and the FARC’s other 6, 000 or so fighters are still in the jungles, waiting for lawmakers to approve the amnesty law that would afford them the legal protections they want before they begin laying down their weapons. When that happens, I’d like to find Yurluey again, and see how she’s coping with life after war.     ’We loved seeing the United States through their eyes. Readers did, too.’ Emily Rauhala,   correspondent    Chen Aiwu, 64, at Great Salt Lake in Utah. (Family photo)  In an otherwise brutal year, my colleague Xu Yangjingjing and I had the pleasure of writing about Chen Aiwu, 64, and her husband, Wang Dongsheng, 66, Chinese retirees who won hearts on their epic American road trip. So often, the story of U. S.  relations is told at a distance with spokesmen for the State Department and the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs in starring roles. There is so much more to the relationship  —   as Chen and Wang’s journey shows. We loved seeing the United States through their eyes. Readers did, too. Many of you wrote to say how nice it was to read their story, a rare bit of “good” foreign news.    ’It’s often difficult to put the ongoing suffering into context.’ Erin Cunningham,   correspondent    Afghan children arrive outside the U. N. center on the outskirts of Kabul. (Andrew Quilty for The Washington Post)  Afghanistan’s story for the past few decades has largely been one of conflict and displacement, so it’s often difficult to put the ongoing suffering into context or to explain to readers why it matters. But that does not mean we should shy away from covering the war, particularly as the U. S. military scales back its presence and support. What was important for me in covering this new wave of displacement was the ability to at least partially access the story, in a country where that has become increasingly difficult  —   if not impossible  —   due to rising threats to civilians and journalists. My colleague Sayed Salahuddin and I were able to meet displaced Afghans    observe the conditions they were living in, and document the effort to assist new refugees crossing the Afghan border. Because of this, and accompanying images from photographer Andrew Quilty, our story ran on the front page, bringing attention to an important but underreported crisis.    ’At no point did any of the mothers or relatives caring for these infants express anything other than love.’ Dom Phillips, Rio de   correspondent    Cleane Serpa, 18, holds    cousin Maria Eduarda, born with microcephaly, at her aunt’s home in Recife, Brazil, on Jan. 9. (Lianne   Pictures for The Washington Post)  We were among the first foreign media to go to Recife to report on Brazil’s microcephaly outbreak, linked to the Zika virus. It was both emotional and inspiring to meet the generally   families struggling to deal with a daunting new reality  —   that their newborn babies were disabled. And yet at no point did any of the mothers or relatives caring for these infants express anything other than love and a determination to deal with the challenge. That’s something that Lianne Milton was able to capture in her remarkable photos. Recife, a big, noisy city in Brazil’s northeast, felt like it was on alert, with troops checking houses for stagnant water. Many of the people we talked to had caught one of three related   diseases that are hard to distinguish between  —   Zika, dengue and chikungunya  —   or had friends or relatives who had. Brazil’s microcephaly outbreak is a story we have returned to again and again. And with scientists and researchers still trying to understand why so much of this rare birth defect is concentrated in a limited area of northeast Brazil, it’s a story that is likely to continue.    ’It was a current affairs event that always fascinated me as a child.’ Ruth Eglash, correspondent based in Jerusalem    Shay Gross stands next to a photo of himself as a    when he returned to Tel Aviv after the hijacking at Entebbe during a ceremony in the Peres Center for Peace in Jaffa, Israel, on June 27. (Jim   Pressphoto Agency)  Having the opportunity to accompany Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to Entebbe, Uganda, this past summer was certainly one highlight of 2016. That was not only because it was a chance to visit Africa and be able to record the Israeli leader’s emotional recollection of the brother he lost during Israel’s dramatic hostage rescue operation there in 1976, but because it was a current affairs event that always fascinated me as a child. Before the trip, I had the chance to meet with some of the former hostages. Like me, they were children at the time an Air France jet was hijacked by German and Palestinian terrorists  —   but they actually lived through the nightmare. One of their stories will always stay with me, that of Anat Brodesky Charniak. One minute she was in the terminal building, she recalled  —   the next, Israeli special forces burst in. Being only six at the time however, what was her most vivid concern? That she did not have time to put on her shoes.    ’I was fascinated to see the way the entire country stopped for a night.’ Karla Adam,   correspondent    From left, Gord Downie and Gord Sinclair of The Tragically Hip perform on Aug. 10 in Toronto. (Arthur   )  As a native Canadian, I pitched this story about a quintessentially Canadian event. I should mention that I live in London and don’t normally write about Canada. But in the lead up to the event, whenever I bumped into someone from my native land, we ended up chatting about this  —   always a sign there could a story there. It’s a story about Gord Downie, the lead singer of the Tragically Hip and Canada’s unofficial poet laureate. He is dying and the band gave one last concert. I was fascinated to see the way the entire country stopped for a night  —   this seldom happens, barring a major hockey game  —   and I wanted to explore why this band, which never really caught on in the United States, meant so much to Canadians.    ’This young   woman is embracing the oldest and most dreaded   in India.’ Rama Lakshmi,   correspondent    A peppy new song flaunting her caste pride by Ginni Mahi has become something of an anthem for many young people in India’s marginalized lower caste communities, called the Dalits. (Rama   Washington Post)  I like this story because this young   woman is embracing the oldest and most dreaded   in India, turning it into a point of pride in her hit rap song. It is a very important moment of empowerment and aggressive   for members of the Dalit group, who were called the “untouchables” for centuries. What was especially interesting was the way the “Chamar Pride” songs are mirroring the “Black Pride” narrative in the United States. Ginni Mahi’s embrace of the “chamar” word resembles the manner in which African American singers have used the “ . ”    ’The mood in my home town foreshadowed much uglier things to come.’ Rick Noack,   writer    Samir   20, in his room in Berlin. (Hani Zaitoun for The Washington Post)  When the influx of refugees into Germany started to take on unprecedented dimensions in summer 2015, I happened to be in my home town, Dresden, in the east of the country. That city had become the center of Germany’s   movement, Pegida. Whereas hundreds of people welcomed refugees at Munich’s central train station and applauded their arrival, residents of Dresden appeared more suspicious. The mood in my hometown foreshadowed much uglier things to come: arson attacks on asylum seekers’ homes and violent protests. Months later, German authorities warned of a “climate of fear. ” Refugees I spoke to in fall 2015 said they felt unwelcome in some parts of Germany but were thankful to Chancellor Angela Merkel for allowing them into the country. It was around that time that my editor, Tiffany Harness, suggested that I follow six refugees as they tried to navigate their way through their first few months in the country. During that time, terrorist attacks shocked the country and the continent, and   movements across the world gained momentum. Germany has changed since the summer of 2015. The six profiles I published in September along with Hani Zaitoun  —   a Syrian refugee himself  —   are only a snapshot of the refugee surge. But their accounts are worth considering amid the ongoing debate on immigration, in which we often miss the voices of those most affected by it. "

","     Snow on Christmas creates the magical scenes that have inspired songs and stories. Even some people who detest snow are enamored by visions of a glistening white landscape on Christmas Day. So which fortunate locations in the Lower 48 will enjoy a white Christmas this year? Presently about 40 percent of the nation has some snow cover and these numbers shouldn’t change too much by Dec. 25.    Snow cover on Dec. 21. (NOAA)  Between Wednesday and Christmas, forecast models suggest snow cover will shrink some in the Northeast and Midwest, and expand in the West. Cities likely to witness a white Christmas include: Burlington, Buffalo, Detroit, Chicago, Milwaukee, Des Moines, Minneapolis, Bismarck, Casper, Billings and Boise.    GFS model forecast of snow cover and depth between Dec. 21 and Dec. 25.  Many of those locations already have snow cover or will gain it over the next few days. The major   will be a storm coming into the West on Friday and Saturday that will dump a lot of snow in the Sierra Nevada and the Rockies. Locations that will not have snow include much of the Interstate 95 corridor from Boston south, the Southern Plains, Southeast and  .  The 40 percent snow cover anticipated on Christmas this year is very close to the   average (39 percent) based on NOAA data. Since 2003, the snowiest Christmas occurred in 2009, when 63 percent of the nation had snow cover while the least snowy Christmas happened in 2003 when nearly 80 percent of the Lower 48 awoke to bare ground.    (NOAA)  2009 was made particularly snowy in the East by a historic snowstorm that slammed the   on Dec.  .  No such anomalous storm has occurred this December. The areas that will end up snowy on Christmas Day will end up matching fairly closely those that are most likely to, based on the past.    Historical chances of a white Christmas.

142390,217846,A supervolcano caused the largest eruption in European history. Now it’s stirring again.,Washington Post,Sarah Kaplan,2016-12-21,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161222013856/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/speaking-of-science/wp/2016/12/21/a-supervolcano-caused-the-largest-eruption-in-european-history-now-its-stirring-again/
","     The Italian name for the caldera  —   Campi Flegrei, or “burning fields” —   is apt. The 7.   cauldron is the collapsed top of an ancient volcano, formed when the magma within finally blew. Though half of it is obscured beneath the crystal blue waters of the Mediterranean, the other half is studded with cinder cones and calderas from smaller eruptions. And the whole area seethes with hydrothermal activity: Sulfuric acid spews from active fumaroles; geysers spout water and steam and the ground froths with boiling mud; and earthquake swarms shudder through the region, 125 miles south of Rome. And things seem to be heating up. Writing in the journal Nature on Tuesday, scientists report that the caldera is nearing a critical point at which decreased pressure on rising magma triggers a runaway release of gas and fluid, potentially leading to an eruption. Forecasting volcanic eruptions is a famously dicey endeavor, and right now, it’s impossible to say if and when Campi Flegrei might erupt, according to lead author Giovanni Chiodini, a volcanologist at the National Institute of Geophysics in Rome. But now more than ever, the caldera demands attention: An eruption would be devastating to the 500, 000 people living in and around it. The site’s last major eruption happened over the course of a week in 1538, when it expelled enough new material to create the cinder cone mountain Monte Nuovo. But the caldera itself is some 39, 000 years old, formed by an eruption larger than anything else in the past 200, 000 years of European history. A 2010 study in the journal Current Anthropology suggested that this prehistoric outburst  —   which spewed almost a trillion gallons of molten rock and released just as much sulfur into the atmosphere  —   set off a “volcanic winter” that led to the demise of the Neanderthals, who died out shortly afterward.  Today, the Campi Flegrei caldera is increasingly restless. For half a century, scientists have measured “bradyseism” events  —   slow movements of the ground  —   that are indicative of molten rock slowly filling the mountain’s magma chamber. Significant uplift in the past decade prompted Italian authorities to raise the supervolcano’s alert level from green (quiet) to yellow (scientific attention) in 2012. “These areas can give rise to the only eruptions that can have global catastrophic effects comparable to major meteorite impacts,” Giuseppe De Natale, head of a drilling project to monitor the caldera, told Reuters after that change was made in 2012. Now, Chiodini and his colleagues have identified the volcano’s “critical degassing pressure”  —   a vital data point in understanding the likelihood of an eruption. As molten rock from the Earth’s interior rises through the crust, it is subject to less pressure, and this decline in pressure causes volatile gases dissolved within it to be released. At the critical degassing pressure point, this process accelerates tenfold. Huge amounts of steam are injected into the surrounding rock. If the magma loses too much water, it may harden and cease its upward motion, stopping the eruption in its tracks. Alternatively, the injections of steam could destabilize the rock, accelerate the deformation process, and ultimately cause the volcano to blow. Chiodini said scientists have seen an increase in ground deformation and   seismic activity around the caldera in recent years. This pattern compares with activity seen around similar volcanoes before their eruptions.  This doesn’t mean residents of Naples should be heading for cover. “In general, unfortunately, volcanology is not a precise science,” Chiodini wrote in an email. “We have many uncertainties and   previsions are at the moment not possible! For example, the process that we describe could evolve in both directions: toward   conditions or to the finish of the volcanic unrest. ” What’s more, volcanoes operate on time scales far beyond the scope of most scientific records. Campi Flegrei has had a major eruption only twice in the past 40, 000 years, and both happened long before the invention of the first writing systems, let alone seismometers. There are written accounts of the 1538 eruption, but there are limits to the scientific insight those descriptions they provide. What they lack in data, however, they make up for in vividness. Take this recollection, written by Italian philosopher Simone Porzio: “The large tract of land which lay between the foot of the mountain . . . and the sea . . . was seen to rise and take the form of the newly produced mountain. And on the same day, at the second hour of the night, this mount of earth opened like a mouth, with a great roaring, vomiting much fire and pumice and stones. ” Read more: In breakthrough experiment, scientists shine a light on antimatter Drone video captures killer whales eating a shark alive A researcher discovered how cave men cleaned their teeth.

142391,217847,The real reason grocery stores are running out of whipped cream this Christmas,Washington Post,Caitlin Dewey,2016-12-21,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161222013856/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/12/21/the-real-reason-you-cant-buy-whipped-cream-this-christmas/
","     If you were planning to serve whipped cream with your holiday desserts this year, you might want to acquaint yourself with the homemade kind. Thanks to a nationwide shortage of nitrous oxide, a critical ingredient in aerosol whipped creams, some major manufacturers have announced that they won’t be able to keep up with holiday demand. Among the companies that expect to see shortfalls are ConAgra, which makes   whipped cream   and Dean Foods, which sells whipped creams under a range of local brands. But the impact of the shortage will likely be more widespread than that, experts say. Dairy cases from Boston to Omaha have already gone empty. The story behind the whipped cream shortage  —   which involves laughing gas, a tragic explosion and a federal investigation  —   reveals one of the industrial food system’s core weaknesses: the increasing concentration of power among a few companies in a few areas and at a handful of plants. “This story is a metaphor for the vulnerability of the entire food system,” said Daniel Block, a professor at Chicago State University who has studied the geography of food distribution. “It serves as a sort of canary in a coal mine, in the case [there] was a real industrial disaster. ”  A key ingredient in whipped cream is nitrous oxide, sometimes called “laughing gas” for its ability to relax people and ease pain when getting teeth pulled. But it also acts as a propellant to get whipped cream out of the can and a preservative to keep it from going rancid. Just two companies, Air Liquide and Matheson   produce nitrous oxide for all of the United States and Canada. Together, they operate five nitrous oxide plants, which supply the three packing facilities that can the majority of America’s whipped creams. At each of these highly consolidated nodes, even a small disruption could impact a large number of products further down the supply chain. “It’s very concerning how vulnerable we’re making our food system to weather, fuel shortages, accidents, strikes, foodborne illnesses,” said Philip Howard, a sociologist at Michigan State University who studies consolidation in the food system. “There are many variables that make it possible that the food on our grocery shelves this week won’t be there the week after. ” On Aug. 28, the Air Liquide nitrous oxide facility in Florida  —   operated by its subsidiary Airgas  —   experienced a fatal explosion that left one man dead. The incident, which is still under federal investigation, reduced the company’s nitrous oxide output in “the ” spokeswoman Sarah Boxler said  —   though she did not give a specific timeline and said that the explosion handicapped the facility “indefinitely. ” Air Liquide has allocated its remaining supply to medical clients first and   its clients in food manufacturing. With a limited supply of nitrous oxide, ConAgra and Dean Foods said they had to slash their whipped cream production, leaving peppermint hot chocolates and gingerbread cakes naked in the midst of the holiday season. “We are proactively managing the production of   and are doing the best we can to make it available to as many consumers as possible,” said Lanie Friedman, a spokeswoman for ConAgra. “We should have our full supply up and running by February. ”  Neither Kraft, which makes Cool Whip, nor Saputo, which sells whipped cream under the Land O’Lakes label, responded to questions about whether they too would see shortages. But because most aerosol whipped cream brands are made at the same large packing facilities, it’s likely that a shortage that impacts one label impacts all of them. “The nitrous oxide shortage has impacted the majority of food suppliers who distribute aerosol products,” said Reace Smith, a spokesperson for Dean Foods. “Our   is working closely with suppliers and allocating the supply based on greatest need. ” Manufacturers say the shortages will strike consumers on a    basis, depending on demand and preexisting inventory. Right now, Smith added, restaurants, hospitals and schools  —   not grocery stores  —   are taking priority. And yet, even after   is back in stores, the core problem will remain: the concentration of food production among a few companies in a few areas and at a handful of facilities. For instance, dairy farms  —   which supply the cream in whipped cream  —   are growing larger and less numerous, as are the dairy cooperatives that distribute their product. The number of dairy manufacturing plants fell by 75 percent between 1970 and 2005, according to the Department of Agriculture. Howard said they see a close parallel in the Eggo waffle shortage of 2009, which deprived consumers of the frozen breakfast food for several months. Kellogg’s, which makes Eggo, eventually revealed the cause was a flood in one manufacturing facility and the outbreak of listeria in another  —   problems that would have had a less dramatic impact, Howard argues, if Kellogg’s had a less concentrated production process.  A similar  —   albeit vastly more dangerous  —   scare broke out around spinach in 2006, when an E. coli outbreak infected 199 people in 26 states. Investigators traced the bug back to a single manufacturing facility in San Juan Bautista, Calif. which processed the spinach sold by 40 different brands across the country. As a result of the ensuing recall, consumers learned that even competing brands, like Earthbound, Dole and   often came from the same places and were processed in the same plants. “If there is a problem at a single facility, there’s a big impact,” said Paul Wolfe, a policy specialist at the National Sustainable Agriculture Coalition, which advocates on behalf of midsize farmers. He calls the   shortage a “symptom of the consolidation taking place” everywhere from pork slaughterhouses to California pear orchards. Reversing the trend will not be easy, Wolfe acknowledged. NSAC has lobbied for more antitrust enforcement in the agricultural sector, particularly in chicken and livestock processing, where the market is dominated almost entirely by four large firms. Howard said he would also like to see regulators reduce subsidies for large companies and do more to empower competition from small producers. He points to craft beer as one industry where such initiatives have worked. Despite the mergers of large beer companies like   InBev and SABMiller, small and independent breweries have flourished, benefiting from federal and local tax incentives that target smaller operations. The number of breweries in the country reached a record high 5, 005 this year, according to the Brewers Association. In the meantime, consumers will still be able to get whipped cream this season if they’re willing to compromise or look around. For instance, brands that have already built up their inventory will be spared, such as Natural by Nature, an organic brand sold along the East Coast. There will also be no impact on   whipped cream products, such as Cool Whip tubs. The best solution, however, might be whipping your own  —   no nitrous oxide required.

","     Three weeks before her wedding day, Cheyann Shaw uploaded a video to YouTube, a space the fitness fanatic regularly filled with workout clips and health tips. But this time was different: She was now using the social video platform for a more emotional and profound purpose. “I’m going to cry,” she said in the video, “but  —   I was told that I have cancer. ” Shaw has stage 4   serous ovarian cancer, a rare and   but stubborn strain that can be resistant to chemotherapy treatments. Over the past four months, she started chemo  —   then realized it wasn’t working. She lost her hair  —   and filmed the moment she shaved her head. She has been diagnosed and   and moved from Florida to Washington state to be closer to her family and specialists. She has undergone surgery to remove her reproductive organs, appendix, spleen and part of her colon, along with a tumor from her abdomen that was the size of a small beach ball. And, she said, she has learned that the ovarian cancer is still in her lymph nodes. She has been sharing her swift decline from a   bodybuilder to a   cancer patient to show that having cancer “doesn’t mean you stop living. ” “I decided to document everything right after I got diagnosed because I wanted to show people what cancer does to a body,” she told The Washington Post last week. She also wanted “to show people that with a positive mind, you can beat this. ”      Cheyann is a bodybuilder and social media star diagnosed with stage 3 ovarian cancer. She has been documenting her cancer fight through videos and photos shared on YouTube and Instagram. (Cheyann Clark)    Shaw, 23, is a real estate assistant for her husband, Kaleb, an agent in Kissimmee, Fla. outside Orlando. She has always been an athlete, playing basketball, softball and soccer. She once raced BMX. Then, about three years ago, she got into fitness. She had her first bodybuilding competition last year, she said, and was preparing for more shows over the summer when her ovarian cancer was diagnosed. Shaw said she had started having symptoms, as early as fall 2015; but in June, she found a lump on her abdomen. Her   told her it was probably a cyst or some torn abdominal muscles from working out too hard. But the next month, she was making trips to the emergency room, with sharp pains and an inability to keep anything down. In August, she said, her doctors found the disease. “Today, August 3rd, 2016 is the day that has changed my life for the moment,” she wrote on Instagram. “I found out today that I have been diagnosed with cancer. . . . I never in a million years thought this would happen to me, especially since I am only 23, but I know I will win this battle. ”    (Courtesy of Cheyann  )  Ever since, Shaw has been posting photos, videos and messages to keep family members, friends and supporters updated on a journey that she warned would be unashamedly raw. “I’m literally going to show you the good, the bad and the ugly,” she said on YouTube, adding, “I’m literally showing you guys everything just so everybody is more aware of ovarian cancer because they do call it ’the silent killer. ’”  Ovarian cancer is uncommon, with about 20, 000 U. S. women diagnosed each year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Most common in postmenopausal women, ovarian cancer begins in the ovaries but can still spread throughout the abdomen. In advanced stages, it is more difficult to treat, according to data from Mayo Clinic. The CDC reports that “ovarian cancer causes more deaths than any other cancer of the female reproductive system, but it accounts for only about 3% of all cancers in women. ” Shaw’s doctor, Renata Urban, said the bodybuilder has epithelial ovarian cancer, in which cancer cells form from the tissues of the gynecologic tract. Urban, who treats gynecologic oncology patients through the Seattle Cancer Care Alliance, said there is no routine screening for ovarian cancer. It is often not diagnosed until the disease is in stage 3 or 4. For patients who are in the advanced stages, she said, the   survival rate is between 30 and 50 percent. The survival rate for epithelial ovarian cancer “is not high,” Urban told The Post. But, she said, younger patients have been found to have better outcomes. “Epithelial ovarian cancers are generally found in older women, so, for her age, it’s uncommon,” Urban said of Shaw. “She’s been extremely courageous and has such a positive attitude. ”  Shaw showed her first chemo treatment on social media. “It wasn’t as scary as I thought,” she wrote on Instagram. She bragged on YouTube about her new   diet of ice cream and macaroni and cheese to help her keep on the pounds during her treatments. And she posted a photo of her first day back in the gym.    (Courtesy of Cheyann  )  In other posts, she has aimed to shed a tragic but truthful light on cancer. “I’m human, I cry and I’m scared,” she wrote in one post, adding: “Cancer has taken so much from me already and on nights like tonight, I try to remember that it is okay to cry; it’s good to cry. I don’t have to be strong all the time, but I will not let cancer take my light and my smile. ”  In September, she posted a video showing the moment she walked into a hair salon to have her head shaved because, she said, “it just bums me out to see my hair falling out. ” “It’s the moment of truth  —   I’m getting my hair cut, er not cut, I’m getting my head shaved,” said Shaw, with her long,   hair. The following month, she appeared in a video from her bedroom in Seattle, saying she had moved there from Florida. She had learned that hers was a rare form of ovarian cancer, she said, and that it was not responding to chemotherapy treatments, which had taken a harsh toll on the body she had worked so hard to sculpt. At her lowest, she weighed 102 pounds, and her body had started eating its own muscles for nutrients, she said. She’s now 107. “I’m skin and bones,” the    Shaw said. On Halloween, she went for surgery  —   filming the moment she went to the hospital, and posting photos after it was done. “Surgery was 5. 5 hours,” she wrote after the operation. “I did have to get a blood transfusion because I did lose a lot of blood. They got all the cancer they could see out, took my spleen, appendix, full hysterectomy, and part of my colon out. I am not cancer free however. There is cancer is a couple lymph nodes. This doesn’t mean I am going to die, it just means I have to fight a lot harder. Scared is an understatement, but I know GOD is with me and I will be fine. ” “Some people may see the cancer being in my lymph nodes a step backwards,” she added, “but I just see it as just another bump in the road. I will never question GOD because I know he is at work to heal me and the devil will try whatever he can to get me to turn my back on the Lord; which will never happen. I will beat this, just have a little longer and harder road to travel on. ” A week later, she posted a picture showing her surgery scar on her   stomach. “When they were in surgery they did find out I’m actually Stage 4 because the cancer was in my spleen and I do have cancer in my lymph nodes, but I’m not worried,” she wrote. “Just another bump to get over and with GOD by my side I’m not scared. I’ll be fine and GOD will get me through this. I have a story to tell and I’m not done telling it and GOD knows that. ” Shaw has started a more targeted form of chemo to attack the cancer in her lymph nodes. “My life has been turned upside down,” she told The Post. “It’s been hard. ” Shaw said her cancer is not terminal, but “there is a chance it may be terminal if some of the methods we have in place don’t work. ” In her most recent video, she sat at the foot of her bed, answering questions about her struggles and her future plans. She said that if and when her doctors clear her, she wants to get back to bodybuilding, repairing and restoring herself after her body was ravaged by disease. “After cancer, I definitely plan on doing more competitions and continuing to build my body because, obviously, I don’t like where it’s at now,” she said. ”But I love myself and I love my body because I truly believe that if my body wasn’t where it was when I first began, I truly believe I’d be a lot weaker than I am now. So definitely, bodybuilding has saved me. ”"

","     John D. Whiting ( ) worked as a tour guide, businessman, writer and photographer throughout the Middle East. Whiting was a member of the American Colony in Jerusalem, which had been established by Christian religious pilgrims from the United States and Sweden as a utopia. An extensive visual history of the colony exists due to the American Colony Photo Department ( ) and its successor, the Matson Photo Service, in which Whiting participated as a photographer and businessman. The photo department proved lucrative for the colony as the demand for images from the region increased and profits were used to improve living conditions for the colonists. He, along with other photographers in the department, kept extensive visual diaries that  include photographs taken primarily during the 1930s depicting daily life in the Middle East, as well as life in the colony. Photographs in this collection show Whiting’s travels from June 30 to Dec. 31, 1938, including a trip to Syria for National Geographic, Palestine (  Israel, the West Bank and the Gaza Strip) and Lebanon.

142394,217854,"In a day of tweets, Trump suggests major change on national security issues",Washington Post,Karen DeYoung,2016-12-22,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161223013722/https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/in-a-day-of-tweets-trump-suggests-major-change-on-national-security-issues/2016/12/22/4d709da8-c873-11e6-8bee-54e800ef2a63_story.html
"," Before lunchtime Thursday,   Donald Trump said he would expand the U. S. nuclear arsenal, upending a reduction course set by presidents of both parties over the past four decades, and called for the United States to veto a pending U. N. resolution that criticized Israel’s settlements policy. The policy prescriptions, communicated in morning tweets, followed calls since last month’s election to reconsider the   U. S. relationship with Taiwan and to let China keep an underwater U. S. vessel seized by its navy. Trump declared within hours of this week’s Berlin terrorist attack that it was part of a global Islamic State campaign to “slaughter Christians” and later said it reaffirmed the wisdom of his plans to bar Muslim immigrants. Late Thursday, Trump suggested in another tweet that the U. S. military’s     plans for a new stealth fighter, Lockheed Martin’s   might be reconsidered, saying he had “asked Boeing to   a comparable   Super Hornet!” With weeks to go before he becomes president, Trump has not hesitated to voice his opinions on national security issues of the day and to publicly advise the current president on what to do about them. Ultimately, the nuclear statement was tempered by a Trump spokesman. And the likely fallout from a tentative decision by the Obama administration to break years of precedent and abstain on the Israel resolution was avoided when Egypt, its sponsor, abruptly postponed it just hours before a scheduled Security Council vote. But the  ’s pronouncements have privately riled a White House that has repeatedly insisted in public that the transition has been smooth sailing. Asked last week whether he was trying to help Trump, a professed admirer of Russian President Vladi mir Putin, understand Russia’s responsibility for the   carnage in Aleppo, Syria, President Obama said he would “help   Trump with any advice, counsel, information that we can provide so that he, once he’s sworn in, can make a decision. ” “Between now and then,” Obama said firmly, it was up to him to decide what to do. “These are decisions that I have to make based on the consultations that I have with our military and the people who have been working this every day. ” Even as the White House has held its tongue, however, others have not. Trump provided no details in his tweet calling for the United States to “greatly strengthen and expand its nuclear capability. ” But “if he means what he says,” said Joe Cirincione, president of the Ploughshares Fund, a   security foundation, “this could be the end of the   process that reduced 80 percent of our Cold War arsenal. ” Former congressman John Tierney ( .) executive director of the Center for Arms Control and   said in a statement, “It is dangerous for the   to use just 140 characters and announce a major change in U. S. nuclear weapons policy, which is nuanced, complex, and affects every single person on this planet. ” Under New START, the treaty negotiated by Obama with Russia and ratified by the Senate in 2010, the United States and Russia by February 2018 must have no more than 1, 550 strategic weapons deployed. While there is widespread agreement that the U. S. deterrent must be modernized, little enthusiasm has been expressed elsewhere for increasing the number of nuclear warheads. Trump spokesman Jason Miller later said that was not precisely what Trump meant. Rather than calling for more nuclear weapons, Miller told Yahoo News, he was referring to “the threat of nuclear proliferation” and “the need to improve and modernize our deterrent capability. ” The  ’s U. N. tweet was more explicit and more immediate. “The resolution being considered . . . should be vetoed,” he said in a   tweet referring to the Egyptian measure. The resolution condemned “the construction and expansion of settlements” in the West Bank and mostly Palestinian East Jerusalem, along with “the transfer of Israeli settlers, confiscation of land, demolition of homes and displacement of Palestinian civilians. ” Saying the settlements have “no legal validity,” it demanded that Israel “immediately cease all settlement activities. ” Although consideration of such a measure has been circulated at the United Nations for weeks  —   and similar measures have for years brought a consistent U. S. veto  —   it was not until Wednesday night that word began to circulate that the United States might abstain and allow it to pass. While successive administrations have considered the settlements an impediment to an   peace process, the Obama administration has grown increasingly irate over what it feels is Israel’s flouting of its concerns. Over the past six months, Israel has announced plans to add hundreds of units to existing settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. A July announcement that 770 new homes were to be built in the East Jerusalem settlement of Gilo drew particularly sharp U. S. criticism. At the same time,   voices in the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu are pushing for legislation that would legalize settlements built on privately owned Palestinian land. The “legalization bill” stems from a   demolition of the Amona settlement, which sits on land owned by a Palestinian farmer. Amona was meant to be demolished next week, but on Thursday it received an additional month of reprieve from the court. Residents brokered a deal with the government to move their homes to a nearby location, essentially creating a new settlement. During the campaign, Trump frequently criticized what he described as the administration’s failure to fully support Israel. Last week, he named David Friedman  —   a New York bankruptcy lawyer who has given strong financial support and other backing to the Israeli settlement movement and has said Trump supports Israeli annexation of Palestinian territory  —   as his ambassador to Israel. During the campaign, Trump also charged that Obama had helped promote terrorism by supporting “the ouster of a friendly regime in Egypt”  —   that of   autocrat Hosni Mubarak  —   and more recently by failing to fully back the military government that overthrew Mubarak’s elected replacement. In an interview last weekend with a Portuguese news agency, Egyptian President Abdel Fatah   said that Trump “has shown deep and great understanding of what is taking place in the region as a whole and Egypt in particular. I am looking forward and expecting more support and reinforcement of our bilateral relations. ” Once it became clear late Wednesday that the settlements vote was scheduled for Thursday afternoon, Trump officials said the transition gave the administration a “ ” that the   was going to publicly call for a U. S. veto. At the end of the day Thursday, it was not entirely clear what led Egypt to withdraw the resolution. At the State Department, spokesman John Kirby said that Egypt had pulled it back in order to have “discussions with its Arab League partners” over the wording of the text. Secretary of State John F. Kerry, who supported an abstention and was clearly expecting to deliver a   speech announcing it, along with an outline of future prospects for Middle East peace, canceled his plans. Elsewhere within the administration, officials said Israel had twisted Egypt’s arm and threatened to work against its interests in Congress. Several Arab officials said they were convinced that the United States had pressured Egypt to postpone the vote. In Israel, where a   cabinet meeting was convened Wednesday to consider the possibility of a U. S. abstention, Netanyahu sent out a    tweet calling for a U. S. veto. It was quickly followed by Trump’s own,   tweet. Deriding “the imposition of terms set by the United Nations,” Trump said in a later statement that passage of the resolution would put Israel “in a very poor negotiating position and is extremely unfair to all Israelis. ” Later in the day, a transition official told the Reuters news agency, Trump spoke by telephone with Sissi.

","       Donald J. Trump piled on fresh criticism of the Pentagon’s most sophisticated aircraft on Thursday, suggesting that he might abandon the   Joint Strike Fighter in favor of an alternate plane due to high costs. In a message on Twitter, Trump said that cost overruns in Lockheed Martin’s $400 billion program to develop the stealth aircraft had prompted him to ask Boeing, another major defense manufacturer, to “  a comparable   Super Hornet. ”   Based on the tremendous cost and cost overruns of the Lockheed Martin   I have asked Boeing to   a comparable   Super Hornet!  —   Donald J.

His criticism of   Lockheed and another major aircraft firm has roiled the defense industry and laid a marker for a hard line from the White House in dealings with major players doing business with the government. Even before Trump launched his public assault, the   the Pentagon’s most expensive weapons program, has come in for widespread criticism for design flaws and spiraling costs.      After   Donald Trump took aim at Lockheed Martin’s   stealth jet project, two of the $100 million fighter jets landed in Israel. They were greeted by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and U.

","       Donald Trump named Republican National Committee official Sean Spicer as White House press secretary, filling what is likely to be a challenging position given Trump’s sometimes hostile relationship with the media and his propensity to bypass staff to communicate directly with the public on Twitter. Spicer, the RNC’s communications director since 2011 and chief strategist since 2015, has become an increasingly visible presence on Trump’s team since the GOP nominee won the election on Nov. 8. Noted for his combative television interviews, he helps to lead daily transition news media calls and has a close relationship with RNC chairman Reince Priebus, Trump’s incoming chief of staff. Trump also announced that longtime aide Hope Hicks, his campaign press secretary, will serve as director of strategic communications, and Dan Scavino will continue his current role as director of social media. Jason Miller, who leads the transition calls, will be communications director.  Spicer, Miller, Hicks and Scavino will all hold the title of assistant to the president, in addition to their other titles. “Sean, Hope, Jason and Dan have been key members of my team during the campaign and transition,” Trump said in a statement. “I am excited they will be leading the team that will communicate my agenda that will Make America Great Again. ” The announcement left open how Spicer, Miller and Hicks will divide up the communications work. Traditionally, the White House press secretary has served as the main conduit between the president and global media through daily news conferences. Priebus suggested last week that this practice could change in the new administration. “Look, I think that many things have to change, and I think that it’s important that we look at all of those traditions that are great, but quite frankly, as you know, don’t really make news,” Priebus said in an interview with conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt. “And you know, even looking at things like the daily White House briefing from the press secretary, I mean, there’s a lot of different ways that things can be done, and I can assure you we’re looking at that. ” Spicer went a bit further in a recent interview with Fox News. “I think you have to look at everything. And so I don’t know that it [the White House press briefing] needs to be daily. I don’t know that they need to be on camera. And I think that’s a view shared by a lot of former White House press secretaries, a view by some in the media, in fact, that the White House press briefings have become somewhat of a spectacle,” Spicer told anchor Megyn Kelly on Dec. 15.

","     The Obama administration on Thursday took the unprecedented step of creating obstacles to a   but poorly understood plan by   Donald Trump to establish a Muslim ban or registry  —   by dismantling the registry system that already exists. The Department of Homeland Security issued a “final rule” to formally dismantle the regulatory framework for the National Security   Registration System (NSEERS) a preexisting government program that was used to register and monitor visitors from “ ” countries from 2002 to 2011. Civil rights advocates, who have been calling for such action, say the program, enacted under former president George W. Bush, already amounted to a registry for Muslims through discriminatory targeting. Obama shelved the program in 2011, but the regulations that allow it to function were never dismantled. Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, who helped the Bush administration create the program after the   terrorist attacks and now advises Trump, has been photographed holding a proposal for NSEERS’s reinstatement while meeting with Trump. The move is the latest in a string of recent efforts by the Obama administration to safeguard current policies and Democratic values that they expect Trump to target. Last week, the Department of Health and Human Services finalized a regulation to block discrimination against Planned Parenthood in the allocation of federal grants, and on Tuesday, the president announced a ban on offshore oil and gas drilling in areas of the Arctic and the Atlantic Ocean.  The Department of Homeland Security said Thursday that it was removing the “outdated regulations” that allowed the program to function. “The Department of Homeland Security is removing outdated regulations relating to an obsolete special registration program for certain nonimmigrants,” the agency said Thursday in a document first reported by the New York Times and confirmed by the agency. The program’s end was a long time coming. “NSEERS was a huge waste of time, money. But no one remembers it. Everyone talks about a Muslim registry, but we had one,” said Mirriam Seddiq, a criminal defense and immigration attorney. Civil rights activists and immigration attorneys say the program disproportionately targeted Muslim men. The program mandated that men over the age of 16 from one of 25 countries on a list were required to register if they were living in the United States.   of those countries were Muslim majority countries. Registration, which involved fingerprinting, interrogations and sometimes     was required, regardless whether the people had broken the law. Those men who overstayed their visas or failed to comply with annual registration requirements or more frequent   were deported. Nearly 180, 000 people registered with the program when it was in place; more than 83, 500 of them were already residing in the United States when the program was enacted. Activists from MoveOn. org and smaller groups, who staged a protest against NSEERS outside the Justice Department last week, say that 13, 000 of them were deported  —   claims that the Department of Homeland Security have neither confirmed nor denied. The DHS inspector general in 2012 recommended abandoning it on the grounds that it was “inefficient and ineffective. ” But, said a senior U. S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations, “with the heat of the rhetoric of a Muslim registry, with the   of religious tests as a kind of purity filter and patriotism filter, a renewed, energized push was begun” to get rid of it. The push was supported by senior administration officials and career civil servants alike across the government, from the White House to DHS to the Justice Department to the FBI and the intelligence community, several senior U. S. officials said. “This is huge,” said Elizabeith Goitein,   of the Brennan Center for Justice’s Liberty and National Security Program. “It’s not going to prevent Donald Trump from trying to institute a Muslim registry, but it will make the process longer and harder. It also sends an important signal to Muslim American communities that they shouldn’t be treated differently, that they shouldn’t be signaled out as automatically suspect. ”        Donald Trump called Monday’s attacks in Europe ”terrible” as he spoke to reporters at    on Wednesday. One reporter asked Trump if the assassination of Russia’s ambassador to Turkey caused him to ”rethink” his policy on immigration and a ban on Muslims. ”You’ve known my plans all along, and I’ve been proven to be right,” Trump said. (Reuters)   Trump’s transition team did not respond Thursday to a request for comment on the measure, and to clarify its intentions in regards to a registry or ban. Asked by reporters about the ban proposal Wednesday, Trump appeared to reaffirm his commitment to the idea, saying: “You know my plans all along. ” His former campaign manager and   White House counselor Kellyanne Conway then told CNN Thursday morning that Trump would not pursue a ban based on religion but rather on country of origin. The incoming administration’s website also contains conflicting statements on this subject. Experts say if Trump wanted to relaunch NSEERS, he could do by having the Department of Homeland Security issue a new administrative rule, which would require a public comments period, which tend to last 30 to 60 days, said Naureen Shah, the director of the Security and Human Rights program at Amnesty International USA, and would likely invite litigation by civil rights attorneys, on the grounds that the program would be discriminatory, in violation of the constitution."
142398,217858,The attorney general could have ordered FBI Director James Comey not to send his bombshell letter on Clinton emails. Here’s why she didn’t.,Washington Post,Sari Horwitz,2016-12-22,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161223013722/https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/the-attorney-general-could-have-ordered-fbi-director-james-comey-not-to-send-his-bombshell-letter-on-clinton-emails-heres-why-she-didnt/2016/12/21/7824d00a-c5fd-11e6-85b5-76616a33048d_story.html
","      Twelve days before the presidential election, FBI Director James B. Comey dispatched a senior aide to deliver a startling message to the Justice Department. Comey wanted to send a letter to Congress alerting lawmakers that his agents had discovered more emails potentially relevant to the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s private email server.  The official in Deputy Attorney General Sally Q. Yates’s office who received the FBI call immediately understood the explosive potential of Comey’s message, coming so close to the presidential election. Federal attorneys scrambled into offices on the fourth and fifth floors of Justice Department headquarters, where they huddled to figure out how to stop what they viewed as a ticking time bomb. “It was DEFCON 1,” said an official familiar with the deliberations. “We were in cred ibly concerned this could have an impact on the election. ” Aides at Justice and the FBI  —   located in offices directly across the street from each other on Pennsylvania Avenue  —   began exchanging increasingly tense and heated phone calls, nearly a   throughout the afternoon and evening of Oct. 27 and into the next morning. Justice officials laid out a number of arguments against releasing the letter. It violated two   policies. Never publicly discuss an ongoing investigation. And never take an action affecting a candidate for office close to Election Day. Besides, they said, the FBI did not know yet what was in the emails or if they had anything to do with the Clinton case. Remarkably, the country’s two top law enforcement officials never spoke. As Comey’s boss, Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch could have given the FBI director an order to not send the letter. But Lynch and her advisers feared that Comey would not listen. He seemed to feel strongly about updating Congress on his sworn testimony about the Clinton investigation. Instead, they tried to relay their concerns through the Justice official whom the FBI had called. Their efforts failed. Within 24 hours of the first FBI call, Comey’s letter was out.  Nearly two months later, the effect of that letter on the 2016 race is still being debated. Clinton told donors recently that she blamed a pair of “unprecedented” events for her loss. One was the Russian hacking of Democratic Party officials. The other was Comey’s letter. Corey Lewandowski,   Donald Trump’s former campaign manager, said in a speech at Oxford University shortly after the election that what Comey did was “amazing” and gave Trump the “spring in his step” he needed to win the election.      (The Washington Post)   An examination of how a single letter from the FBI became a political bombshell reveals that it was the result of two law enforcement leaders failing over months to navigate the unusually ugly politics of 2016. Having a presidential candidate under active criminal investigation was extraordinary. But Comey and Lynch repeatedly underestimated how much their actions would reverberate in a closely contested presidential race.  Lynch’s meeting in June with Bill Clinton on a tarmac in Phoenix led to a crisis in leadership at the department over how to handle the Clinton email investigation. Rather than formally recuse herself, Lynch left ambiguous who would be making final decisions on issues regarding Hillary Clinton. Into that vacuum stepped Comey, an FBI director who prides himself on having a finely tuned moral compass that allows him to rise above politics. Weeks before the letter, Comey had advised against the Obama administration public statement admonishing Russia for the Democratic Party hacks, arguing it would make the administration appear partisan too close to the election. But to him, the Clinton email investigation was different. Battered by Republican lawmakers during a hearing that summer, Comey feared he would come under further attack if word leaked about the Clinton case picking up again. He was surprised by the intensity of the reaction to his letter, according to people familiar with Comey’s thinking. His reputation fell further after the FBI acknowledged three days before the election that the emails amounted to nothing. Comey has taken the harsher beating in public for his decision, but some political observers and former Justice officials say that Lynch deserves at least as much scrutiny. Jack Goldsmith, a Harvard Law School professor and senior fellow at Stanford University’s Hoover Institution, said that the controversy shines a light on Lynch’s compromised position and failed leadership as attorney general. “If she thought [the letter] violated department policy or was otherwise a bad idea, she could have ordered him not to send the letter,” said Goldsmith, who noted that soon after the letter was released, Justice officials proceeded to criticize Comey when Lynch had the power all along to stop him. “It was an astonishing failure of leadership and eschewal of responsibility, especially if Lynch really thought what Comey did was wrong. ” A former senior FBI official who worked closely with Comey for several years said that Comey’s sense of obligation to Congress was the key factor driving his decision. He had testified under oath months earlier that the Clinton investigation was closed. But another factor that day was that Lynch’s credibility had been compromised months earlier in Phoenix. “Anybody who’s ever worked with Jim Comey knows that he has an independent spirit,” the official said. “But he still very much believes in the chain of command. If he has a boss who’s asking him to do something that’s in the scope of the law and reason, he’s going to follow it. He would have followed protocol. Had the issue with Loretta Lynch on the tarmac not happened, things would be different. People forget that. ” The tarmac    Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch, shown in Phoenix on June 28, spoke to Bill Clinton on the tarmac at the airport. (Nancy  )  It was a sweltering June day in Phoenix, and Lynch’s plane had just landed at the airport. She and four staffers had flown west for a series of meetings with local police officers. The staffers walked down the plane stairs first and stepped into a van on the tarmac. The plan was for Lynch  —   and her husband, who was also on the trip  —   to follow quickly afterward and step into another vehicle. As the staffers waited for about five minutes in the van, checking their smartphones, they suddenly saw a man with silvery white hair approaching the plane. At first, the staffers could not tell who it was. But then, as the man got close to the airplane steps, one of the staffers said with surprise, “Is that Bill Clinton?” It was. Clinton had just wrapped up a fundraiser for his wife and arrived at the tarmac to fly out of Phoenix. His Secret Service detail tipped him off that Lynch was there, too, and he sent word that he wanted to say hello. Lynch felt she could not say no to the former president, who 17 years ago promoted her to U. S. attorney. Once inside the plane, Lynch said that she, Clinton and her husband discussed their travels, Clinton’s grandchildren, golfing and Brexit. But as the visit dragged on, Lynch became anxious. The Justice Department was still conducting an investigation into Hillary Clinton’s email practices during her tenure as secretary of state. Lynch had just wanted to say a quick hello to Bill Clinton, and now they had been talking for close to half an hour. Her aides outside were also concerned. One of them got out of the van and walked back onto the plane to tell Lynch that they needed to get moving. Lynch would later insist that she and Clinton did not discuss the investigation into his wife. But the optics were immediately damaging. Republican legislators raised questions about whether Lynch and the Justice Department’s investigation had been compromised.  Four days later on July 1, Lynch acknowledged in an interview with Washington Post editorial writer Jonathan Capehart that her meeting with the former president “cast a shadow over how [the Clinton] case may be perceived” and she “certainly would not do it again. ” Then, in an effort to allay any concerns, Lynch said she would “fully accept” the recommendations of career prosecutors and the FBI on how to proceed with the Clinton case. Capehart pressed her to explain. Did that mean she would review their recommendation and make her own judgment? No, she said. He asked further. Did that mean she was recusing herself from the case? Lynch did not give a clear answer. Those close to Lynch said that she planned all along  —   before the tarmac incident even  —   to accept the recommendations of the FBI and career prosecutors. To this day, aides say she does not see any connection between her meeting with Bill Clinton and what Comey would do next. ‘Extremely careless’    FBI Director James B. Comey, shown at the agency’s headquarters in Washington on July 5, filled the leadership vacuum created by Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch, some analysts say. (Cliff   Press)  Four days after Lynch’s remarks, Comey, known for his independent streak, called reporters to FBI headquarters on Pennsylvania Avenue to announce the conclusion of the   Clinton investigation. It was a stunning event both because of what he said and how he said it. Usually, in a   case, the FBI makes a recommendation to the Justice Department, and then the attorney general  —   not the FBI director  —   announces in a news conference the final decision on any charges. It is rare for officials to hold a briefing when prosecutors decline to pursue a case. In this case, Lynch and other Justice officials did not even find out that Comey was holding a briefing until shortly before he began speaking. At the news conference, Comey stood wedged between two FBI flags as he read a prepared speech to reporters. “I have not coordinated this statement or reviewed it in any way with the Department of Justice or any other part of the government,” Comey said. “They do not know what I’m about to say. ” He proceeded to sharply criticize Hillary Clinton for her use of a private email server while she was secretary of state, calling her behavior “extremely careless. ” But he said that the bureau would not recommend criminal charges against her. “Although there is evidence of potential violations of the statutes regarding the handling of classified information, our judgment is that no reasonable prosecutor would bring such a case,” Comey said. Justice officials were shocked. They had never seen an FBI director deliver such remarks. “He was out there on his own,” said a former   Justice Department official. “That was unheard of, unprecedented. Lynch did not recuse herself but also was not fully participating, which left a vacuum that the FBI director decided to fill. ” Comey, though, felt that given the highly politicized nature of the case, the FBI needed to practice radical transparency for the public to trust the government’s findings on the case. “I think the confidence of the American people in the FBI is a precious thing, and I want them to understand that we did this investigation in a competent, honest and independent way,” Comey said in a   internal memo sent to all FBI employees shortly before he spoke. “Folks outside the FBI may disagree about the result, but I don’t want there to be any doubt that this was done in an apolitical and professional way and that our conclusion is honestly held, carefully considered, and ours alone. ” Two weeks before the Republican National Convention, Comey’s announcement ignited a blast of criticism from Republicans and Trump supporters who said the investigation’s outcome had been influenced by politics. “The system is rigged,” Trump tweeted. Two days later, Republicans on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee grilled Comey for five hours. In September, he was brought before the House Judiciary Committee. “My first question is this, would you reopen the Clinton investigation if you discovered new information that was both relevant and substantial?” Rep. Lamar Smith ( .) asked Comey during the hearing. “It’s hard for me to answer in the abstract,” Comey replied. “We would certainly look at any new and substantial information. ” ‘Case reopened’    Part of a Nov. 6 letter from FBI Director James B. Comey to Congress is shown. Comey tells Congress that a review of new Hillary Clinton emails has “not changed our conclusions” from earlier this year that she should not face charges. (Jon   Press)  On Oct. 3, FBI agents seized a computer and other electronic devices from Anthony Weiner, the disgraced former congressman who was now being accused of having a sexual relationship online with a    girl. In their search for evidence, the agents stumbled upon something else: 650, 000 emails stretching over several years with thousands possibly tied to Clinton’s private server and associated with Clinton and Weiner’s estranged wife, Huma Abedin, a senior aide to the Democratic presidential nominee. Within days, Comey was notified of the discovery. At that point, the agents and their supervisors did not know how many of the emails could be relevant, if they contained classified information or were duplicates of evidence that had already been investigated. They also could not peer into the contents of any Abedin or Clinton emails because they only had a search warrant for   evidence. The agents were directed by FBI officials to do more work and report back to Washington when they had a better idea of the scope of the material on the computer and how much might be linked to Clinton. Two more weeks went by as the bureau brought in their computer forensic experts to further examine what appeared to be on the computer, but not look at the contents of the emails. Finally on Oct. 27, three weeks after the emails had first been discovered, agents made a presentation to Comey in his office. They still had no idea what was in the emails, only that there were thousands associated with Abedin, including some correspondence with Clinton. To learn if there was classified information on the emails, they would need a search warrant. Comey agreed it was time. He also began wrestling with whether to notify lawmakers. He worried that getting a warrant would alert more people to the probe, increasing the chances of a leak to the media. He feared a huge outcry if anyone learned the FBI was again investigating Clinton’s emails without informing Congress. Comey would later privately tell lawmakers that he was “stuck in a really bad place. ” FBI officials contacted career prosecutors who had worked the Clinton email case to ask what they thought about sending the letter. Don’t do it, they advised. Meanwhile, Justice officials decided that neither Lynch nor her deputy, Yates, should order Comey to not send the letter. They were not sure how Comey would respond to such a command. And they too feared leaks. Lynch and her advisers were nervous about how it would look if people found out that she, a Democratic presidential appointee, told Comey to keep secret from Congress a new development in the Clinton investigation. Instead, they tried to convince Comey that he had never promised to update Congress at every turn. He had merely said he would “look at” any new information in the case. When that did not work, they made one last effort to contain the damage. Justice officials wanted Comey to simply say that he had new information that might be related to the Clinton probe, and to make clear the FBI did not know whether the new material was significant. The FBI did not take their advice, as Justice officials would learn after they saw Comey’s final letter when he sent it to Capitol Hill. The FBI director said the emails “appear to be pertinent to the investigation. ” Rep. Jason Chaffetz ( ) tweeted, “Case reopened. ” This was exactly the impression from the letter that Justice officials feared most. Half an hour later, Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway tweeted, “A great day in our campaign just got even better. FBI reviewing new emails in Clinton probe. ”  Matt Zapotosky and Adam Entous contributed to this report.     "

","     The problems started after Erich Burger returned from an unforgettable safari in Botswana and Zambia last month. The Baltimore software engineer got sick the day after he got home. He headed to a community hospital after about a week of fever and chills, thinking he might have malaria given his recent travel to Africa. Clinicians took a detailed travel history, admitted him to the intensive care unit as his blood pressure plummeted and ordered blood tests. A   hematology technician discovered when she looked in her microscope that he was suffering from a disease so rare in the United States that it has been seen only 40 times in the past 50 years. The disease is one of the few “universally lethal” infections: It always kills unless it is treated, and it kills quickly. It is often what went wrong that dictates the course of stories about exotic diseases or the challenge of diagnosis. But in this case, the opposite was true: At every step, Burger encountered   workers who did the right thing at the right time, with little precedent for their decisions, while everyone raced the clock.      Erich Burger near Chobe National Park in Botswana. He went on safari and became ill. (Patrick Sosnowski)  Burger, 48, spent about four weeks this fall in Botswana and Zambia with his wife, Bernadette, his brother, Dorsey, a wildlife biologist, and friend, Patrick Sosnowski. It was a reunion of a safari trip they had taken together two decades earlier. They roamed game parks without guides, driving 30 to 60 miles a day in rented Toyota Land Cruisers, spotting wildlife that included lions, elephants, hyenas, even a python. Burger and his wife returned to Baltimore on Nov. 19. When he developed fever, aches and chills the next day, he thought he had picked up a minor bug  —   and that the long flights were catching up with him. He got progressively worse and had to skip Thanksgiving at a relative’s house. On Monday, Nov. 28, Burger went to his primary care doctor. Initial blood tests showed some troubling indicators, such as elevated readings of liver enzymes. The doctor suggested    medication to control the fever. But by Dec. 1, Burger had nausea and was having bad night sweats and difficulty getting out of bed. His wife drove him to the emergency room at Greater Baltimore Medical Center in Towson, Md. the hospital where his doctor is affiliated. Burger could barely stand. His blood pressure had fallen to 70 over 52 millimeters of mercury; a typical reading is 120 over 80. For several hours, Burger received intravenous fluids to stabilize his blood pressure before being admitted to the intensive care unit. “He was very sick. Once that top number is much below 100, it’s often associated with a patient who is in shock,” said David Vitberg, the ICU doctor at GBMC who oversaw Burger’s care. The ER team took his travel history, including the specific countries he had visited. Like Burger, doctors thought malaria was the most likely suspect, even though he had taken   medication. The ICU team started Burger on medication to treat malaria and sent his blood to the lab for a positive diagnosis.    While on safari in Botswana and Zambia, Burger and his group saw a great variety of wildlife, including hippos. (Erich Burger)  A panic alert The order for a blood parasite test was at the top of Gail Wilson’s   list when she arrived for work at 7 a. m. Friday, Dec. 2. She has worked for 22 years as a medical technologist, the last two at GBMC. She knew the procedure would take several hours. The blood smears  —   one thin and one thick  —   needed to dry for three hours first before a stain could be applied that would highlight any parasites. Looking at his blood cells under a microscope, she realized he didn’t have malaria. Instead, she found a rare and lethal parasite most clinicians have only seen in textbooks. Wilson had to look really hard because “there were just a few on my slide and could have easily been missed,” she said. But there they were, some   parasites that looked “like a wavy kind of ribbon with a dot in the middle,” she said. Wilson recognized the distinctive shape from competency exams she is required to take every year. “When I first saw it, I was like, ‘Oh, no,’ ” recalled Wilson. “I knew it was serious and that the patient could die. ” After conferring with colleagues and supervisors, she notified Burger’s nurse that the blood parasite screen was positive for trypanosome parasites. The notification was a panic alert reserved for lab tests that show extreme or unusual results. Wilson realized that Burger had African trypanosomiasis, or sleeping sickness  —   a deadly disease spread by the tsetse fly. It was 10:55 a. m.    This slide shows the parasite, in dark blue, in Burger’s blood. The parasite causes African trypanosomiasis, also known as sleeping sickness, which is fatal within months if not treated. (Courtesy of the Greater Baltimore Medical Center)  Among infections, African trypanosomiasis is in a special category. “Unlike almost any other infection, this is a death sentence if it’s not treated,” said Theresa Shapiro, a clinical pharmacology professor at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, who has spent much of her career studying the disease. Along with HIV and rabies, sleeping sickness is one of the few “universally lethal” diseases: they are always fatal without treatment. The disease has two forms, both transmitted by the tsetse fly, which lives only in rural Africa. The parasites for both forms look identical. West African trypanosomiasis accounts for virtually all reported cases of sleeping sickness, according to the World Health Organization. A person can be infected for months or years without major signs or symptoms of the disease. Initial symptoms include fever, headache, and muscle and joint aches. But left untreated, the disease progresses to the central nervous system after one to two years, leading to personality changes, daytime sleepiness and progressive confusion, according to the CDC. Death usually occurs in about three years. East African trypanosomiasis is more rare but kills within months. Nearly all cases are reported in parts of eastern and southeastern Africa, including Uganda, Tanzania, Malawi and Zambia. People at greatest risk are tourists, hunters and others working in or visiting game parks, where hoofed animals are the main reservoirs for the parasite that causes the disease and tsetse flies are common. Over the past century, the disease has caused several epidemics in Africa, and those hardest hit live in the most remote parts of the continent. In the United States, most cases of sleeping sickness have been in travelers such as Burger, on safari in East Africa. Within seconds of Wilson’s panic alert, the information popped up in Burger’s electronic medical record. Vitberg and the rest of Burger’s medical team happened to be in his room during their daily rounds. “I think I said, ‘Holy cow, I’ve never seen that before,’ ” Vitberg recalled. He knew that making a diagnosis of African trypanosomiasis in the United States was “probably a     career experience. ” He wanted to make absolutely sure. On the laptop, he immediately pulled up an online medical reference, an industry standard known as UpToDate, and rifled through the sections on the disease. He asked Burger whether he remembered being bitten by tsetse flies, “and he was immediately able to tell me he was bitten when he was in Africa,” Vitberg recalled. Burger suspects he was bitten by tsetse flies while walking through game parks. “They’re sizable and they hurt and they tend to land on you and they stay,” Burger said. Once, he had a dozen flies on his back. It was too hot to wear anything but shorts and   he said. Insect repellent is not particularly effective against tsetse flies, which can bite through lightweight clothing. Immediately, the diagnosis shifted from a consideration to near 100 percent confidence. What was worse, Burger’s medical team knew he must have the   East African form of the disease because of his travel history and because he got sick so quickly after infection. But no one knew which stage of the disease he had, and the treatments are different  —   and dangerous. Within minutes, the hospital’s infectious disease doctor, Alina Sanda, started making calls, including to the CDC’s   parasitic diseases hotline, to ask for help. The drugs to treat the disease are extremely toxic, and only the CDC has a supply. Sanda, with seven years as an infectious disease doctor, had only learned about sleeping sickness in theory. “I never took care of a patient with it, so that made me anxious and worried,” she said. Unable to reach someone at the CDC right away  —   she left a message on a recording  —   Sanda contacted an infectious disease colleague at Hopkins for help. Robin McKenzie, an infectious disease specialist, had never treated African trypanosomiasis, either. But she was able to reach an epidemiologist at CDC’s parasitics diseases branch. It was just before 2 p. m. ’The stakes are very high’ At the CDC, epidemiologist Eugene Liu spoke with both infectious disease experts, consulted with another CDC expert and began putting the wheels in motion for the agency to get the medicine and transport it to Baltimore. His background is also infectious disease, but he had also never cared for a patient with African trypanosomiasis. “It is very rare, even for the CDC,” he said. GBMC sent electronic images of the blood smear to Atlanta, and the CDC lab confirmed it showed the lethal parasites. But now a critical question loomed. Which medicines to send? The medications differ depending on the form of the disease and how far the infection has spread. Suramin, discovered in 1920, is used to treat patients with the East African form if the parasites are only in blood. But if the parasites have reached the central nervous system, a much more toxic medication is the only treatment. Called melarsoprol, it is basically arsenic. “Between five and 10 percent of people die from the treatment because it’s so toxic,” said Shapiro, the Hopkins sleeping sickness expert. Untreated, the patients always die. “So the stakes are very high,” she said.    Burger and wife Bernadette on safari. He is recovering from African sleeping sickness after a   technician spotted the parasite in a lab test. (Patrick Sosnowski)  The CDC, which maintains a stockpile of therapeutics to treat rare, serious or   diseases, decided to send both medicines, just in case. By then, the agency’s regular drug service was closed. Liu had to get the medicines from an emergency supply at the Parasitic Diseases Branch. He wrapped 10 ampuls of the melarsoprol and five vials of suramin in bubble wrap and put them in a package marked with a    “emergency medical supply” label. The agency’s Emergency Operations Center arranged for the medicine to be flown on a Delta Air Lines flight leaving Atlanta at 10 p. m. for   International Airport. Liu waited outside the agency’s security gate for the courier. There would be no charge for the medicine or the emergency transportation. The only way to tell whether Burger had parasites in his central nervous system was by performing a spinal tap to collect the clear fluid that circulates in the space surrounding the spine and brain. But there was concern about when to do the spinal tap. If the infection had not yet spread to the central nervous system, injecting a needle into Burger’s back could make things worse. “Often when you do a spinal tap, as you push the needle through the skin and muscle, you drag in red blood cells from those tissues,” Vitberg said. That could introduce parasites from the blood into the spinal column. By then, it became clear that Hopkins, an academic medical center with more resources and expertise, would be better equipped to treat Burger than GBMC, a community hospital. Burger arrived by ambulance at Hopkins on Friday evening. The medicines from the CDC arrived a few hours later, at 1:30 a. m. Saturday, Dec. 3. Burger got his first dose of suramin on Saturday, an intravenous treatment that lasted four hours. That allowed the drug to reduce the level of parasites in his blood so doctors could do a spinal tap the next day to check for parasites or evidence of infection in his spinal fluid. The results showed no parasites and no sign of infection. “That was a big relief for me,” Burger said. Within days, he was feeling better. On Dec. 8, he was discharged, one week after he showed up in the emergency room. He still needs one more treatment, on Friday. And doctors must monitor him closely because the drug can be toxic to the kidneys and liver. He has developed an itchy rash on his arms, legs and chest. But he feels lucky and grateful to the CDC and the personnel at both hospitals, especially to technician Wilson who first spotted the parasite. She, more than anyone, saved his life. He’s thinking of framing the electronic image of the parasite from her blood test, but he may hold off. He still needs to have a spinal tap every six months for the next two years to make sure the parasites aren’t lurking in his nervous system. And he doesn’t want to press his luck. And yet, he would not hesitate to travel to Africa again. “Really, my answer has always been, of course I’ll go back to Africa,” said Burger, who has made several trips, starting when he was 15. “I don’t want to go through life too frightened of the risks to actually live and enjoy. I’m not going to stop traveling because a fly bit me. ” Read more: Behind the scenes of a U.

","  BEIRUT  —   Syria’s government declared Thursday that it had regained full control of Aleppo after the last rebel fighters and civilians evacuated the key city as part of an agreement brokered by Russia and Turkey. The Syrian military announced on state media that “security and stability” had been returned to eastern Aleppo, once the largest rebel stronghold. The “terrorists”  —   a term used by the Syrian government to describe nearly all of its opponents  —   had exited the city, the military said.  President Bashar  ’s consolidation of Aleppo marks the end of the opposition presence in the city for the first time since 2012, in perhaps the most important battleground in the country’s raging civil war and a major blow to the rebellion to unseat Assad.  With crucial military and economic aid from Russia and Iran, Assad’s grip on power now looks much firmer compared with the uprising against him that erupted in 2011. The Syrian leader and his allies are poised to consolidate their hold on areas of the country under their control and further squeeze the beleaguered rebellion elsewhere. His critics in the United States, Turkey and Saudi Arabia must increasingly grapple with a Syria, or at least major parts of it, that is now firmly under his control.

","   John McCain, a Republican, represents Arizona in the U. S. Senate.             The words “never again” ring hollow as the city of Aleppo, Syria, has fallen to regime forces of Bashar  . A brutal siege that has ground on for years was finally brought to a bloody end by a surge of Russian airpower, Iranian shock troops and assorted regional militia fighters. As we eulogize the dead of Aleppo, we must acknowledge the United States’ complicity in this tragedy. President Obama speaks of the need to “bear witness” to injustice. He did little else for Aleppo. To what have we borne witness? To the use of smart bombs to target women and children, hospitals and bakeries, aid warehouses and humanitarian convoys. To the development and popularization of barrel bombs  —   oil drums packed with shrapnel and explosives, dropped indiscriminately from aircraft to kill and maim as many civilians as possible. To the tactic of   airstrikes designed to kill rescue workers, such as the intrepid White Helmets, who rush to the scene of an attack to save the innocent. And now to the busloads of refugees pouring out of Aleppo and the tens of thousands left behind to the tender mercies of the Assad regime and its Russian and Iranian allies. Obama has borne witness to all of this, and more, and done nothing to stop it. As with past atrocities, Aleppo’s destruction inspired much   talk and the illusion of action. Endless meetings in the gilded palaces of Geneva and Vienna and elsewhere. Red lines drawn and transgressed with no consequences. Statements like this: “Should we really accept the notion that the world is powerless in the face of a Rwanda, or Srebrenica?” the president asked the U. N. General Assembly in 2013. “If that’s the world that people want to live in, they should say so, and reckon with the cold logic of mass graves. ”  That reckoning is now upon us. The mass graves are before us, and the name Aleppo will echo through history, like Srebrenica and Rwanda, as a testament to our moral failure and everlasting shame. Even in a conflict that has killed nearly 500, 000 people, driven half of Syria’s population from their homes, created the worst refugee crisis in Europe since World War II and spawned the terrorist army of the Islamic State  —   even amid all this horror and depravity, Aleppo stands out. Aleppo may be lost, but the war in Syria is far from over. It will likely get worse as the Assad regime, Iran, Russia, Turkey, the Kurds, the Gulf states and others intensify their fighting over what is left of Syria’s carcass.  The United States still has a choice to make. The longer we wait to help end the war, the worse our options will become. But no one should believe that we have no choice. We must acknowledge that we have a stake in what happens in Syria. It is not just about the suffering of others, as moving as that is. It is about the national security of the United States: The resurgence of   in Syria affects us. The rise of the world’s most advanced terrorist organization affects us, as we saw in Paris and San Bernardino, Calif. A refugee crisis that destabilizes allies such as Israel and Jordan and threatens the foundation of Western democracies affects us.  We must also acknowledge that Assad, Russian President Vladimir Putin and Qasem Soleimani, commander of Iran’s Quds Force, will never be viable counterterrorism partners. In fact, the opposite is true. The Syrian regime, Russia and Iran are not fighting the Islamic State. Their indiscriminate slaughter of Syrian civilians is what created the conditions for the Islamic State’s emergence. The bloody siege of Aleppo will be a windfall for terrorist radicalization and recruitment. To think that we can destroy the Islamic State by throwing in our lot with those who are strengthening it every day is a dangerous fantasy.  Finally, we must acknowledge that ending the conflict in Syria will not be possible until Assad and his foreign backers realize they cannot succeed militarily. And make no mistake: Succeeding militarily is what they are trying to do. The fall of Aleppo will only encourage them to turn their guns on their next targets in Syria. We must recall the wisdom of former secretary of state George Shultz: “Diplomacy not backed by strength will always be ineffectual at best, dangerous at worst. ” Just because America cannot stop every horror in the world does not absolve us of the responsibility of using our great power to end the worst injustices where we can, especially when doing so would benefit our own interests and make the United States and our partners more secure. We do not need to become the world’s policeman to defend our interests. But we cannot wall ourselves off from the chaos of our dangerous world. And if we try, the instability, terror and destruction at the heart of that chaos will eventually make their way to our shores.

"," Bob Gates has worked in senior national security positions for the past five presidents, Republican and Democratic. So it’s noteworthy  —   and to me, encouraging  —   that he is advising   Donald Trump, too.  Gates, a former defense secretary, CIA director and deputy national security adviser, spoke with me by telephone Wednesday about the advice he’s giving Trump and his team  —   and the opportunities and pitfalls ahead.  At the top of Gates’s   list is striking the right balance between improving relations with Russia and appearing too cooperative with a belligerent President Vladimir Putin. “I think the challenge for any new administration would have been how to thread the needle  —   between stopping the downward spiral in U. S.  relations, which had real dangers, and pushing back on Putin’s aggressiveness and general thuggery,” Gates said.  “If you only want to stop the downward spiral, you empower Putin to feel that he can do whatever he wants. I worry that if you don’t have pushback  —   let him know there are limits, and that the U. S. will react, militarily, if necessary  —   then the chance of being taken advantage of is larger. ”  Gates said that if he had been defense secretary when Russian jets made “dangerously close passes” over U. S. warships in the Baltic Sea in April, “I’d have recommended that we send a message to Moscow that the next time you do it, I’ll ‘paint’ you [with targeting radar] and I may shoot. ”  If Trump is seen as too eager to cooperate with Russia, Gates cautioned, it will create perceptions in Europe, China, North Korea and Iran that “this guy isn’t prepared to back up his words with the tough action that’s necessary. ”  Trump made a surprising, and somewhat ominous, pushback against Moscow on Thursday. After Putin said he planned to “strengthen the military potential of strategic nuclear forces,” Trump tweeted: “The United States must greatly strengthen and expand its nuclear capability until such time as the world comes to its senses regarding nukes. ”  Gates told me Thursday that he wished Trump had used the word “modernize,” rather than “expand,” but that “what he said is okay, given Putin’s recent comments. ”  Gates has shared the role of informal counselor to the Trump transition team with two other veterans of the Bush administration, former secretary of state Condoleezza Rice, who talks regularly with Vice   Mike Pence, and former national security adviser Stephen Hadley. The three have a consulting firm, RiceHadleyGates, which has proposed candidates for Cabinet and   jobs, including Rex Tillerson and retired Marine Gen. James N. Mattis, the choices for State and Defense, respectively.  Gates, Hadley and Rice have also talked with foreign governments that are puzzled about how to approach Trump. In an interview this week, Hadley summarized his basic advice:  “We’ve never had a populist movement or political insurgency quite like this  —   that actually captured the White House. That means there will be more discontinuities in our foreign policy. I’m telling people: ‘Give us some space here and have some strategic patience. And don’t overreact  —   even to Trump’s tweets.’ ” One issue that worries Gates is the multiplicity of people surrounding Trump in the White House, seeking to influence an undisciplined chief executive. “What happens when someone tries to get in to see the president with a proposal or initiative and is rebuffed by one gatekeeper  —   and simply goes through another door? It’s a formula for a disjointed process. ”  “There will be a rough   period,” Gates predicted. Part of the challenge is that Trump believes his success stems from his freewheeling, undisciplined style, and personal messaging through Twitter  —   which makes him resist limits.  Gates credits Trump for choosing strong personalities for the key national security posts: Tillerson, Mattis and retired Gen. John F. Kelly at Homeland Security. “He’s willing to surround himself with very strong figures who . . . will tell the president what he needs to hear. ”  Trump’s insurgent, populist style has worried many foreign governments. But Gates argues that “there is some value in a disruptive approach  —   in the U. S. not being so reliably passive” in responding to events as it seemed during the Obama administration.  Trump, by accident or design, has created a hint of the triangular dynamic among the United States, Russia and China that was a hallmark of Richard Nixon and Henry Kissinger’s diplomacy. Ideally, said Gates, the United States could play off Russia and China so that “they’re both uncertain about where we’re headed. ”  But this subtle play requires a strategic vision and disciplined    —   two qualities that Trump has yet to demonstrate.

142403,217863,Why the white working class votes against itself,Washington Post,Catherine Rampell,2016-12-22,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161223013722/https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/why-the-white-working-class-votes-against-itself/2016/12/22/3aa65c04-c88b-11e6-8bee-54e800ef2a63_story.html
"," Why did all those Economically Anxious Trump voters reject policies that would have helped relieve their economic anxiety? Maybe they believed any Big Government expansions would disproportionately go to the “wrong” kinds of people  —   that is, people unlike themselves. Hillary Clinton’s unexpected loss, particularly in traditionally blue strongholds, has led to lots of rumination about what the Democrats must do to reclaim their political territory. Smarter marketing, smoother organization, greater outreach and fresher faces are among the most commonly cited remedies. But there seems to be universal agreement, at least among the Democratic politicians and strategists I’ve interviewed, that the party’s actual ideas are the right ones.  Democrats, they note, pushed for expansion of   subsidies for   and   Americans; investments in education and retraining;   tax cuts; and a higher minimum wage. These are core,    improving policies. They would do far more to help the economically precarious  —   including and especially white   voters  —   than Donald Trump’s   tax cuts and trade wars ever could. Here’s the problem. These Democratic policies probably would help the white working class. But the white working class doesn’t seem to buy that they’re the ones who’d really benefit.  Across rural America, the Rust Belt, Coal Country and other hotbeds of Trumpism, voters have repeatedly expressed frustration that the lazy and less deserving are getting a bigger chunk of government cheese.  In Kentucky, consumers receiving federal subsidies through the Obamacare exchanges complain that neighbors who are less responsible are receiving nearly free insurance through Medicaid. “They can go to the emergency room for a headache,” one woman told Vox’s Sarah Kliff.  In Ohio, white   focus group participants decried that women who “pop out babies like Pez dispensers with different baby daddies” get “welfare every month” and “their housing paid for, their food. ” These women seem to live large, one participant said, while people like herself are “struggling to put food on the table. ”  Participants in this focus group, held by the Institute for Family Studies, were also skeptical of efforts to raise the minimum wage.  Opponents argued either that higher pay wasn’t justified for   less intense work or that raising the minimum wage would unfairly narrow the pay gap between diligent folks such as themselves and people who’d made worse life choices. “That son of a      is making $10 an hour! I’m making $13. 13. I feel like     because he’s making almost as much as I am, and I have never been in trouble with the law and I have a clean record, I can pass a drug test,” said one participant.  In Wisconsin, rural whites are similarly eager to “stop the flow of resources to people who are undeserving,” says Katherine J. Cramer, a political scientist at the University of Wisconsin at Madison and author of “The Politics of Resentment: Rural Consciousness in Wisconsin and the Rise of Scott Walker. ”  The people Cramer interviewed for her book often named a (white)   neighbor or relative as someone who belonged in that basket of undeservings  —   but also immigrants, minorities and   elites who were allegedly siphoning off more government funds than they contributed. More broadly, a recent   Post survey found that Trump voters are five times more likely to believe that “average Americans” have gotten less than they deserve in recent years than to believe that “blacks” have gotten less than they deserve. (African Americans don’t count as “average Americans,” apparently.) None of this should be particularly surprising.  We’ve known for a long time, through the work of Martin Gilens, Suzanne Mettler and other social scientists, that Americans (A) generally associate government spending with undeserving, nonworking, nonwhite people; and (B) are really bad at recognizing when they personally benefit from government programs. Hence those oblivious demands to “keep your government hands off my Medicare,” and the tea partyers who get farm subsidies, and the widespread opposition to expanded transfer payments in word if not in deed.  Rhetoric this election cycle caricaturing our government as “rigged,” and anyone who pays into it as a chump, has only reinforced these misperceptions about who benefits from government programs and how much.  It’s no wonder then that Democrats’ emphasis on downwardly redistributive economic policies has been met with suspicion, even from those who would be on the receiving end of such redistribution. And likewise, it’s no wonder that Trump’s promises  —   to   millions of (technologically displaced) jobs and to punish all those    moochers  —   seem much more enticing. No American likes the idea of getting a “handout”  —   especially if they believe that handout is secretly being rerouted to their layabout neighbor anyway.

142404,217864,Democrats are intimidated by Trump’s Cabinet of successful superstars,Washington Post,Ed Rogers,2016-12-22,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161223013722/https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2016/12/22/democrats-are-intimidated-by-trumps-cabinet-of-successful-superstars/
","       Donald Trump is getting his share of criticism for appointing effective, wealthy business executives and leaders from the private sector to his Cabinet. Democrats would have you believe that people who have been magnificently financially profitable in America are somehow disqualified from helping shape American policy. But here’s a different way of looking at the Cabinet Trump has assembled: This may be the most successful group of people brought together to serve a common purpose in Washington in at least the last 50 years. The list of those willing to bring their expertise to the aid of their country keeps growing. Trump announced Wednesday that billionaire investor Carl Icahn will serve as a special adviser to the Trump administration, specifically on regulatory issues. He will not draw a salary or be considered a government employee. And that appears to be more than Democrats can bear. They are lambasting this as an insider arrangement that will somehow benefit Icahn. Democratic National Committee spokesman Eric Walker went so far as to say, “The corrupt nature of this arrangement cannot be understated. Voters who wanted Trump to drain the swamp just got another face full of mud. ” Really? How is Icahn generously volunteering his time and knowledge to help rein in President Obama’s excessive era of regulations proof of corruption? If you remember, Obama tapped a number of CEOs to join his President’s Council on Jobs and Competitiveness, including Jeffrey R. Immelt, who served as council chair while he was also the chairman of General Electric. Jim McNerney, chairman and CEO of Boeing, and AOL   Steve Case also sat on the council, along with numerous other American business leaders. If they were able to advise Obama on “ways to create jobs, opportunity, and prosperity for the American people” without being corrupt, why is it that a guy like Icahn can’t help Trump identify ways that regulations may hinder economic growth? And, oh, by the way, Trump might actually listen to Icahn’s recommendations and implement changes to help boost the American economy. I said in 2012 that Obama’s creation of a jobs council was “nothing more than a throwaway talking point for his apologencia to use to try to mask the truth of his   core beliefs. ” The jobs council only met four times before it fell apart. The fact is, Obama used the business leaders on the council as props designed to suggest he cared about business. What a joke. The president who famously declared “You didn’t build that” when talking about productive American business owners wasn’t actually interested in what the council might have had to say. We should be grateful that people like Icahn are willing to participate and give the   advice. And good for Trump for recognizing that involving accomplished business leaders will be beneficial to the economy. This move further reinforces that business is back. Trump’s welcoming of business leaders is wildly different from Obama’s open contempt for entrepreneurs and business owners. We should want the most successful people we have to feel welcome to chip in and, dare I say, work to make America great again."
142405,217865,I’m a Marine veteran. A recently retired Marine shouldn’t be defense secretary.,Washington Post,Ruben Gallego,2016-12-22,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161223013722/https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/im-a-marine-veteran-a-recently-retired-marine-shouldnt-be-defense-secretary/2016/12/22/f8354d7e-c62f-11e6-85b5-76616a33048d_story.html
","   Ruben Gallego, a Democrat, represents Arizona’s 7th District in the U. S. House of Representatives.         As a combat veteran of the Marine Corps and a longtime admirer of Gen. James N. Mattis, I was sad to annouce this month that I could not in good conscience support granting him a waiver to serve as our 26th secretary of defense.  I explained that my decision was motivated not by political considerations but by concern for the enduring American principle of civilian control of the military. I lauded Mattis’s eminent qualifications and leadership skills while affirming that this central tenent of our democracy should matter more than any single individual.  What happened next was revealing.  Despite my considered words, I got an earful from Marines across the country, including men I served alongside in Iraq. They called and wrote letters. They tweeted and texted. In some colorful language that I can’t repeat in this space, they questioned my loyalty to the Marine Corps and to our country. Paradoxically, their passionate defense of Mattis and their anger toward me confirmed my reservations about his appointment. For me, the reaction immediately verified the wisdom of Congress in establishing a   period for former military leaders. The anger that my stance elicited among many of my fellow Marines demonstrated, albeit on a small scale, the danger to our democracy of a defense secretary coming to power with the ardent loyalty of the men and women he recently commanded.  The members of Congress who, in 1947, enshrined in law this period of separation had fresh memories of World War II. Like our Founding Fathers, they recognized that political leaders should derive their authority from the will of the people  —   not the personal fealty of members of the armed forces. As a result, they were wary of a decorated general slipping off his uniform and immediately stepping into an ostensibly civilian role. In addition, they were justifiably apprehensive about installing a secretary of defense who could be perceived as partial to one service over the others.  More than a   later, these concerns are still highly relevant. We should ask ourselves whether the reputation of our military as a highly professional, nonpartisan institution would be tainted if its most respected leaders were allowed to seamlessly segue into political positions. That’s why, instead of simply     Donald Trump’s choice, it is critical that we engage in a meaningful debate before discarding this   precedent. The last time a recently retired military man, the great George Marshall, was permitted to lead the Pentagon, the United States was facing the prospect of ignominious defeat in the Korean War. Even then, congressional leaders specified that his waiver was a   exception to the rule. While our country must confront an array of threats today, none of our national security challenges remotely compares to a massive war in the Far East. This history should inform Congress’s decision about Mattis. When it comes to something as basic as civilian control of the military, I strongly believe waivers should be granted for extraordinary circumstances  —   not extraordinary people. Many of my fellow Democrats disagree. Recognizing Mattis’s exceptional judgment and ability, they believe he could serve as a counterweight to Trump  —   a partial antidote to our new commander in chief’s profound lack of expertise, experience and discipline on matters of national security. I certainly sympathize with this view. However, I am equally concerned about the kinds of decisions that will emanate from the White House if, as appears likely, the national security adviser, the homeland security secretary and the defense secretary are all former generals. The American people should demand a diversity of views and experiences  —   both military and civilian  —   in the Situation Room. When debate on Mattis’s waiver resumes in January, a   precedent will be at stake. Future generations of American leaders  —   perhaps facing circumstances far more perilous than our own  —   will look at how we dealt with this test of our commitment to civilian control of the military. Congress would be wise to uphold this   principle by denying Mattis a waiver to serve as secretary of defense.

"," The fall of Aleppo just weeks before Barack Obama leaves office is a fitting stamp on his Middle East policy of retreat and withdrawal. The pitiable pictures from the devastated city showed the true cost of Obama’s abdication. For which he seems to have few regrets, however. In his    news conference, Obama defended U. S. inaction with his familiar false choice: It was either stand aside or order a massive   ground invasion.  This is a transparent fiction designed to stifle debate. At the beginning of the civil war, the popular uprising was ascendant. What kept a rough equilibrium was regime control of the skies. At that point, the United States, at little risk and cost, could have declared Syria a   zone, much as it did Iraqi Kurdistan for a dozen years after the Gulf War of 1991. The U. S. could easily have destroyed the regime’s planes and helicopters on the ground and so cratered its airfields as to make them unusable. That would have altered the strategic equation for the rest of the war.  And would have deterred the Russians from injecting their own air force  —   they would have had to challenge ours for air superiority. Facing no U. S. deterrent, Russia stepped in and decisively altered the balance, pounding the rebels in Aleppo to oblivion. The Russians were particularly adept at hitting hospitals and other civilian targets, leaving the rebels with the choice between annihilation and surrender. They surrendered. Obama has never appreciated that the role of a superpower in a local conflict is not necessarily to intervene on the ground, but to deter a rival global power from stepping in and altering the course of the war. That’s what we did during the 1973 Yom Kippur War, when Moscow threatened to send troops to support Egypt and President Nixon countered by raising America’s nuclear alert status to Defcon 3. Russia stood down.  Less dramatically but just as effectively, American threats of retaliation are what kept West Germany, South Korea and Taiwan free and independent through half a century of Cold War. It’s called deterrence. Yet Obama never had the credibility to deter anything or anyone. In the end, the world’s greatest power was reduced to bitter speeches at the United Nations. “Are you truly incapable of shame?” thundered U. S. Ambassador Samantha Power at the butchers of Aleppo. As if we don’t know the answer. Indeed the shame is on us for terminal naivete, sending our secretary of state chasing the Russians to negotiate one humiliating pretend   after another. Even now, however, the Syria debate is not encouraging. The tone is anguished and emotional, portrayed exclusively in moral terms. Much less appreciated is the cold strategic cost. Assad was never a friend. But today he’s not even a free agent. He’s been effectively restored to his throne, but as the puppet of Iran and Russia. Syria is now a platform, a forward base, from which both these revisionist regimes can project power in the region.  Iran will use Syria to advance its drive to dominate the Arab Middle East. Russia will use its naval and air bases to bully the Sunni Arab states, and to shut out American influence. It’s already happening. The foreign and defense ministers of Russia, Iran and Turkey convened in Moscow this week to begin settling the fate of Syria. Notice who wasn’t there. For the first time in four decades, the United States, the once dominant power in the region, is an irrelevance. With Aleppo gone and the rebels scattered, we have a long road ahead to rebuild the influence squandered over the past eight years.   Donald Trump is talking about creating safe zones. He should tread carefully. It does no good to try to do now what we should have done five years ago. Conditions are much worse. Russia and Iran rule. Maintaining the safety of safe zones will be expensive and dangerous. It will require extensive ground deployments, and it risks military confrontation with Russia. And why? Guilty conscience is not a good reason. Interventions that are purely humanitarian  —   from Somalia to Libya  —   tend to end badly. We may proclaim a “responsibility to protect,” but when no American interests are at stake, the engagement becomes impossible to sustain. At the first losses, we go home. In Aleppo, the damage is done, the city destroyed, the inhabitants ethnically cleansed. For us, there is no   option. If we are to regain the honor lost in Aleppo, it will have to be on a very different battlefield.

"," MELBOURNE, Australia  —   Police arrested seven suspects who were allegedly planning a series of bomb attacks in the heart of Australian’s second largest city on Christmas Day, an official said Friday. The seven men had been inspired by the Islamic State group and planned attacks on Melbourne’s Flinders Street train station, neighboring Federation Square and St. Paul’s Cathedral, Victoria state Police Chief Commissioner Graham Ashton said. Police had been watching the alleged plotters for some time, and believed they were preparing to use explosives and other weapons, Ashton said. Police believed the threat had been neutralized through the raids Thursday night and Friday morning, he said. Victoria state Premier Daniel Andrews said there will be extra police on the streets of Melbourne on Christmas Day to make the public feel safe.   Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull speaks during a media conference in Sydney regarding a plot to attack prominent sites in the city of Melbourne with a series of bombs on Christmas Day that authorities described as ”an imminent terrorist event” inspired by Islamic State. (David  )  Ashton said police had gathered unspecified evidence in the raids that the plotters were planning to use explosives in their attack.  “We gathered the makings of an improvised explosive device,” Ashton said. He added: “Certainly (there was the) potential for quite a number of people to be injured or killed in this attack. ” About 400 police officers were involved in the raids.

142408,217868,Eric Trump suspends operations of his charitable foundation,Washington Post,David A. Fahrenthold,2016-12-22,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161223013722/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/12/22/eric-trump-suspends-his-foundations-operations/
","     Eric Trump is suspending the operations of his charitable foundation  —   ceasing all fundraising  —   after facing questions about whether the foundation donors might get special access to members of the first family. “No new money will come into the ETF bank account,” Trump wrote in an email message on Thursday. That decision appeared to go beyond a pledge Trump had made a day earlier to the New York Times: In that interview, Trump said he would cease personally raising money for the foundation, but left the broader fate of the foundation uncertain. The Eric Trump Foundation, founded in 2007, raises more than $1. 5 million a year through a golf tournament, online auctions and other events. One recent auction, for instance, offered a   paid internship at the Trump Organization, which came with the chance to sit down for 15 minutes each with Eric Trump and his siblings Donald Trump Jr. and Ivanka Trump. In another auction, the foundation offered a chance to pitch a business idea to Eric Trump over lunch. The Eric Trump Foundation has one paid employee: Eric Trump did not respond to a question about her job status while the foundation is suspended. The foundation does no direct charitable work, but rather passes on the bulk of the money it raises to St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital, a   center in Memphis. St. Jude named a surgery and   unit after the Eric Trump Foundation in 2015, after the foundation made a pledge to donate $20 million over 10 years. In all, the Eric Trump Foundation has donated about $7. 9 million to the hospital. Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that the foundation was auctioning off a coffee with Ivanka Trump  —   the  ’s daughter, and an influential adviser to Donald Trump. The Times reported that bids had risen to more than $72, 000, and that the top bidders were people seeking to influence Trump’s policymaking. That auction was canceled after the Times story ran. That controversy was followed by another one, involving another charity  —   and another apparent offer to sell access to Trump family members. In that case, first reported by TMZ. com, Eric Trump and his brother Donald Trump Jr. were listed as “honorary  ” of a   fundraiser. According to a draft invitation, donors could pay $500, 000 to go on a multiday hunting trip with one or both of the Trump sons, or pay $1, 000, 000 for a private reception with the president. The host of that “Camouflage & Cufflinks” gala was listed as the Opening Day Foundation, a charity registered just days earlier in Texas. As first reported by the Center for Public Integrity, that Texas charity listed both Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr. as directors. The Trump transition team later said none of the Trumps had been involved in the planning of the event. Later, the two Trump sons’ names were removed from the charity’s registration. Both those episodes seemed to show that the Trump family  —   whose members have spent years monetizing personal appearances, both for profit and for charity  —   have not prepared themselves for a new world in which their father is president, and such    arrangements look like  . So far, Donald Trump has not set any explicit limits on his involvement with his global business empire. His two eldest sons  —   who are supposed to run the business empire while Trump is president  —   have also been deeply involved in the presidential transition process, even helping to select some Cabinet secretaries. In interview over email on Thursday, Eric Trump still seemed to be searching for the right way to wall off his personal life  —   including his charitable work  —   from his new, informal role as presidential adviser. After Eric Trump told The Post that he was suspending the entire foundation, The Post asked: Why? Couldn’t Eric Trump simply step away from the foundation, but leave it functioning in his absence? “Maybe that’s an option, but not one I have thought much about,” Eric Trump replied. “I will however think about your suggestion. ” Eric Trump said that the remaining money owed to St. Jude under the $20 million pledge could be covered by Trump Organization properties, including the hotels  —   which regularly ask guests to donate to St. Jude. “The small dollar donations direct to St Jude from the hotels raise millions of dollars a year and would more than fulfill the obligations (we are years and years ahead of the pledge),” Eric Trump wrote. One of the longtime members of the Eric Trump Foundation’s board, Andrew Joblon, said Thursday that he was saddened to learn that the foundation would be suspended. “When I spoke to Eric last night he reassured us that when his father was out of office we could resume our efforts for supporting the cause we have become so passionate about,” Joblon wrote in an email, noting that he and Eric Trump had met with the families of children treated at St. Jude. “It is with great sadness that I type this because we have poured our heart and soul into this cause to help children with severe illness at one of the world’s best institutions,” Joblon wrote in another email. “The only ones losing here are the kids and that to me doesn’t sit very well. Eric, or any of the board members have never leveraged business relationships for donations. ”   Donald Trump, by contrast, has said nothing about the fate of his own charity, the Donald J. Trump Foundation, as he prepares to take office. The Donald J. Trump Foundation was prohibited from fundraising by the New York attorney general, who acted after The Washington Post reported that it had been soliciting funds without obtaining the proper state registration. But recent tax filings made clear that, if the charity begins fundraising again, it could be a conduit for outsiders seeking to influence Trump. In 2015, for instance, a politically active Ukrainian steel magnate used his own foundation to give $150, 000 to Trump’s foundation. The gift came in connection with a brief speech that Trump gave by video to a conference in Kiev. Donald Trump’s charity is also under investigation by New York attorney general, which began after The Post revealed that Trump had used the charity’s funds to buy large portraits of himself, and to pay off legal settlements involving his own   businesses. Tax law prohibits acts of “” in which nonprofit leaders use money meant for charity to buy items for themselves or their businesses. “The Trump Foundation’s fundraising activities remain suspended following the Attorney General’s Notice of Violation. Our investigation is ongoing,” Amy Spitalnick, a spokeswoman for New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman (D) said in a statement. In a recent tax filing, the Donald J. Trump Foundation admitted to the IRS that it had violated the “ ” ban in at least two years, but the charity has provided no more details about when, or how, it violated that law. Hope Hicks, a Trump transition spokeswoman, did not respond to a question about the fate of the Donald J. Trump Foundation sent Thursday morning."

","     Scientists on Thursday announced a milestone in the fight against Ebola, reporting that a major trial of an experimental vaccine shows that it may be “highly protective” against the virus, which has infected nearly 30, 000 people and killed 11, 000 worldwide since 2013. Although the current outbreak has been contained, health officials fear the deadly pathogen could come back and have been racing to develop new ways to stop it should that scenario unfold. The new study, led by the World Health Organization, was based in a coastal region of Guinea known as  . The vaccine showed 100 percent efficacy in protecting those who got it. More than 11, 800 people participated in the trial. “While these compelling results come too late for those who lost their lives during West Africa’s Ebola epidemic, they show that when the next Ebola outbreak hits, we will not be defenseless,”   Kieny, the study’s lead author and WHO assistant director general for health systems, said in announcing the results. When preliminary findings were unveiled in July 2015, WHO Director General Margaret Chan called the vaccine a potential “ . ”  Guinea was one of three West African nations hit hardest by Ebola beginning in 2014. Researchers are running two parallel studies of the same vaccine in Sierra Leone and Liberia, the other epicenter countries. The vaccine used in the study, known as   and licensed by Merck, involves just a single shot. Both the U. S. Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency have designated it for streamlined regulatory approval. A number of other vaccines  —   developed by GlaxoSmithKline and the Beijing Institute of Biotechnology, among other groups  —   also have shown promise and are advancing in human trials. The Guinea trial, described in the Lancet, used an approach known as “ring vaccination,” which the researchers described as the same approach used to eradicate smallpox. It involves tracing all individuals who may have been in contact with every new person diagnosed with the virus, from relatives who live in the same household to visitors and those who may have been in close contact with the infected person’s clothes or linens. In some cases, contacts of contacts also were considered to be at risk.  Ultimately, researchers identified 117 “rings,” or clusters of people, for the study. Each was made up of an average of 80 people. At the beginning of the trial, which took place in 2015 when the virus was still actively spreading in the region, the rings were randomly divided into two groups. One was to get the vaccine immediately and the other after a   delay. When the first results showed that the vaccine was working, everyone was offered it immediately. Those 18 and older got it initially, then children older than 6. The results were striking: In the group of 5, 837 people who received the vaccine immediately, there were zero Ebola cases. In the other group, which included those who got a delayed vaccination as well as those who were never vaccinated, there were 23 cases. Kieny and research team members from Guinea’s Health Ministry and other international partners also noted that vaccination appeared to create a type of “herd immunity” that indirectly protected people who had not been vaccinated. But more research will be needed to confirm this theory, they said. Two serious adverse events were reported after vaccination, with one participant spiking a fever and another suffering an allergic reaction. Everyone else either reported no side effects or very mild ones such as headache, fatigue and muscle pain. No effects were long term. Despite researchers’ caution that more studies are needed to confirm the vaccine’s safety for children and other vulnerable groups, such as individuals with HIV, they already are making plans to accelerate its rollout should future trials further confirm safety and effectiveness. Merck has committed to having 300, 000 emergency doses available soon and to submit the licensing application to regulatory authorities by the end of 2017. In a commentary piece  —   optimistically titled “First Ebola virus vaccine to protect human beings?”  —   virologist Thomas Geisbert of the University of Texas wrote that the study data were so strong that it seemed likely that the vaccine “probably contributed to controlling the 2013 —  16 outbreak of Ebola virus disease in Guinea.” As encouraged as he seemed by the study, Geisbert also raised a number of questions. Researchers still don’t know whether the vaccine is   he said, asking, “Is it still protective, for example,   years after the vaccination?” He also noted that safety questions came up in the early testing. Still, he wrote, “After 40 years we appear to now have an effective vaccine for Ebola virus disease to build upon. ” Read more: The Ebola outbreak may have been bigger than believed, with ‘invisible’ infection Ebola stayed in the semen of one man for 565 days, raising new public health concerns The Ebola virus mutated to better infect humans during the 2014 outbreak"

"," A newly declassified House Intelligence Committee report states that Edward Snowden, a former National Security Agency contractor who passed secrets to journalists, “has had, and continues to have, contact with Russian intelligence services”  —   but says the evidence is classified. Snowden, 33, has been in Moscow since June 2013, when he left the country to avoid prosecution for sharing classified information about NSA and other   programs. His material, provided to outlets including The Washington Post, led to some significant changes to intelligence gathering, such as a ban on the government’s mass collection of Americans’ phone metadata. It also sparked controversy over whether some of the revelations damaged national security. The   report, completed in September and issued in declassified form Thursday with substantial redactions, does not provide any evidence for the assertion. Instead it says the “cited material [is] classified. ” Snowden has said he never gave information to Russian intelligence. He told Yahoo anchor Katie Couric in an interview this month that Russians did try to get him to talk: “And I said, ‘Look, guys, I don’t have any information. I don’t have any documents. I’m not going to cooperate. ’” He said that “the government has left me alone, for the most part. ” Ben Wizner, Snowden’s attorney and a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union, said that if the committee “had any evidence to support that false accusation, they would show it. ” The report also cites a NPR report that quotes a Russian parliament member who, the intelligence committee said, asserted that “Snowden did share intelligence” with the government. Snowden told Couric that the NPR report involved a “mistranslation” in which the individual was “speculating” that Russia’s spy services would approach him. “It didn’t happen,” he said. “I’ve never shared information with Russia’s intelligence services. ” Snowden has said repeatedly that he did not take any documents when he left Hong Kong, where he had initially flown after leaving the United States in 2013. “And while I’m sure they were disappointed,” he said of the Russians, “it doesn’t take long for an intelligence service to realize when they’re out of luck. ” In a June YouTube interview, former NSA deputy director Chris Inglis said he doubted that Snowden was “in the employ of the Chinese or the Russians. ” Said Inglis, “I don’t see any evidence that would indicate that, and even if they were careful in terms of practicing denial and deception, I think there would be certain telltales” that would show that Snowden was giving up intelligence. The committee chairman, Rep. Devin Nunes ( .) said the report gives the public “a fuller account of Edward Snowden’s crimes and the reckless disregard he has shown for U. S. national security. . . . It will take a long time to mitigate the damage he caused, and I look forward to the day when he returns to the United States to face justice. ” The committee’s ranking Democrat, Rep. Adam B. Schiff ( .) said, “Snowden and his defenders claim that he is a whistleblower, but he isn’t, as the committee’s review shows. ” Snowden tweeted his response: “Bottom line: this report’s core claims are made without evidence, and are often contrary to both common sense and the public record. ” The report’s allegations come as Snowden’s supporters are making a push to have President Obama pardon him, arguing he is a whistleblower whose acts revealed government surveillance of breathtaking scope. The committee has urged Obama not to grant a pardon, asserting that Snowden carried out “the largest and most damaging” leak of classified information in U. S. history. "
142411,217872,An interview with the AP photographer who took the iconic shot of Russian ambassador’s assassin,Washington Post,Colby Itkowitz,2016-12-22,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161223013722/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/inspired-life/wp/2016/12/22/an-interview-with-the-ap-photographer-who-took-the-iconic-shot-of-russian-ambassadors-assassin/
","         It was the photograph seen around the world. Like a still from a Quentin Tarantino movie, a man in a suit points his gun forward, his mouth slightly agape and in  . He had just assassinated   the Russian ambassador to Turkey at a photo exhibition in Ankara. The man who captured the terrifying image, who kept his camera trained at the gunman during the chaos and fear, was not even there to cover the event. The   Associated Press photographer was meeting on a whim for dinner with an old friend, who suggested they meet at the photo gallery first. But Burhan Ozbilici, 58, is a pro. He rarely goes out without his laptop and camera. A journalist does not stop being a journalist. And in that moment, his duty to document the event outweighed the grave personal risk of standing in plain sight of a man waving a gun. He has received accolades from all over the world, from people both in the media and outside it, awed by his resolve in the midst of an unfolding crisis.    Burhan Ozbilici (Associated Press)  “What bravery AP’s Burhan Ozbilici showed to capture those photos,” Barry Malone, online editor at Al Jazeera English, said in a tweet. “Wire staff very often unsung and very often the heroes of this trade. ” But a career covering chaos prepared him as best as anyone could be prepared to witness a murder. Early in his journalism career, a year before he started working for the Associated Press, he was covering an event in June 1988 when an assassin attempted to kill   Prime Minister Turgut Ozal. People ran; Ozbilici stayed. The police shot the gunman, and Ozbilici knelt by him and took pictures. “When that happened, everyone was in panic, and of course I saw my life in front of me, my childhood, my teenage years, like a movie scene,” he said Wednesday in an interview in English and Turkish. “Then I had a sense that I never harmed anybody, I never did anything bad, I never stole anything, I am a decent person. That gave me some peace. This also brought me confidence. I said to myself, ‘Nothing will happen to me, and God will protect me. ’” Ozbilici has covered wars and earthquakes and famine and devastation. He has seen death and heartache and people at their absolute lowest moments. He has lost friends who died photographing conflicts. So on Monday evening, when Ozbilici steadfastly began photographing the armed shooter, his experiences kept him grounded. He said he also remembered how his father always told him that if you are ever in a dangerous situation and you have the chance to do good, take the risk. As a boy in Turkey, he said he was always writing and exploring. He loved nature and was filled with curiosity. He was, he said, a journalist even then, keeping a diary of everything he did. His father called him a “wild wolf,” he said, and would tease that he best be careful that the real wolves didn’t eat him. To this day, he has remained fearless. Suzan Fraser, a colleague in the AP’s Ankara bureau since 1996, recalled a time they went to interview a government minister. The official did not like her questions and accused her of being a “foreign agent” working on behalf of “foreign interests. ” As the tense interview neared its conclusion, Ozbilici looked up from his camera and defended her. “Suzan,” she remembers him saying, “you have to show the esteemed minister some understanding. He is not used to being interviewed by independent journalists who dare ask difficult questions. He is used to taking questions from journalists who are close to the government. ” Fraser said both she and the minister were stunned by Ozbilici’s boldness. But Ozbilici is also deeply empathetic. In the two days since the shooting, he has thought mostly of the slain Russian ambassador, Andrei Karlov, whom he described as a calm,   and decent person. “I was so sorry, so sad.   …     He lost his life in front of my eyes,” he said. “I was so sad and wishing people would all learn enough, get enough of a lesson from this tragedy so it never happens again. ” Brian Murphy, a Washington Post editor, who worked closely with Ozbilici when he was on assignment as a foreign correspondent in Turkey, said his friend was often thinking about others. He recalled a time they were covering the 1999 earthquakes that devastated Istanbul, sleeping outside to report on the devastation that befell one town east of the city. “I was working on a story about one block of the town, recounting the deaths and misery  ” Murphy said. “Down the street  —   amid piles of rubble and shattered furniture  —   I saw kids gathered around Burhan. He had brought a bag full of sweets from Istanbul and was giving them to grateful kids who lost their homes and, in some cases, their parents. ” He had similar instincts when earthquakes hit Pakistan in 2005. Most journalists stayed for only short stints because there was no water to bathe or wash clothes in and because food was scarce. But Ozbilici stayed longer than most, cleaning himself in rivers and often putting down his camera to aid wounded people. “To do humanitarian missions is really important,” he said, “and it’s part of journalism. ” So is getting the story. “I thought it was my professional and moral responsibility. I could be wounded or even killed, but I have to do my work,” Ozbilici said of his courage Monday. “I believe in the power of photos. I believe the power of the photo will be more powerful than a million words. ” Gaye Gunes in Washington contributed to this report.

142412,217873,Coach K suspends Grayson Allen — 10 months too late,Washington Post,Barry Svrluga,2016-12-22,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161223013722/https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/colleges/coach-k-suspends-grayson-allen--10-months-too-late/2016/12/22/f6722616-c868-11e6-bf4b-2c064d32a4bf_story.html
"," The first thing that comes to mind regarding serial tripper Grayson Allen is: What makes a person keep doing this? The second, after Duke announced that Coach Mike Krzyzewski had suspended Allen indefinitely following his egregious trip of an Elon (Elon?) player Wednesday night, is: Would a   suspension 10 months ago have stopped Allen’s reckless   behavior?  And, in what might seem ancillary but is far from so for those who care about college basketball: Does anyone remember that Louisville beat Kentucky on Wednesday night? That tense and taut   affair  —   which should have put a focus on college basketball that the sport yearns for in every month not named March  —   was kicked to the side by Allen’s right foot, which intentionally and inexplicably found the back side of the left leg of Elon guard Steven Santa Ana in what became a   victory for the heavily favored Blue Devils. Few situations offer Krzyzewski, his sport’s career leader in coaching victories, no choice. Suspending Allen was one of them. “What Grayson did was unacceptable,” he told reporters afterward, which is akin to pointing out the sun rises in the east.     Elon’s Steven Santa Ana gets tripped by Duke’s Grayson Allen in the first half of Wednesday night’s game. (Chuck  )  So before we trip over ourselves (sorry) in lauding Krzyzewski for taking this step, it’s worth pointing out that he should have taken it Feb. 26. That’s the day after Allen tripped Florida State’s Xavier   which came all of 17 days after he tripped Louisville’s Ray Spalding. Wednesday’s cheap shot, which came after Santa Ana had beaten Allen with a spin move along the baseline, had the entire sport focused not just on Allen, who’s moving his way up the seeding of the “Most Hated Duke Player Ever” bracket, but on how Krzyzewski would handle him. “No more gifts,” Jay Williams said on ESPN. “We’re done with that. He deserves to sit. ” That there is    crime, because Williams played for Krzyzewski’s 2001 national champs. And it’s a measure of how obvious Krzyzewski’s choice was Wednesday. “As a program, we needed to take further steps regarding his actions that do not meet the standards of Duke Basketball,” Krzyzewski said in a statement. Have the standards of Duke [b]asketball changed since February? Because that’s when Allen tumbled to the floor after a drive, then  —   while prone  —   swung out his right leg to trip Spalding, who was trying to push Louisville into a fast break at Duke’s Cameron Indoor Stadium. That’s also when Allen slyly stuck his left leg out behind him to trip   who was innocently headed upcourt in the waning seconds of a Duke win at Cameron. The day after the FSU incident, when Allen officially became a repeat offender, Duke was all but silent on the matter, saying the incident had been “handled internally. ” That turned over the ball to the ACC, which decided Allen deserved a “reprimand”  —   whatever that is  —   but no suspension. “The first time, you call the kid in and say, ‘What the hell’s wrong with you? ’” said former Maryland coach Gary Williams who, like Krzyzewski, is a Hall of Famer. “If you take the temperature around the game, the second time, you suspend him. ” Krzyzewski didn’t. And now, another season, and a new version of the same cheap shot from Allen. Yes, Allen was assessed a technical foul after he kicked Santa Ana. Yes, he was despondent on the bench and contrite in the locker room. Yes, Krzyzewski arranged for a meeting, and an apology, with Allen, Santa Ana and Elon Coach Matt Matheny afterward. And now comes the suspension. But it leaves people wondering: What in the world makes a player as good as Allen continue to do that? “Here’s the thing: Part of growing up when I grew up is you had to prove yourselves on the playgrounds,” Williams said. “If you ever tried to trip somebody like that, you’d have to fight your way off the court. Kids today, they don’t play outside. Everything’s controlled. You kind of miss disciplining yourself as you grow up as a player.  “Allen’s a great competitor. He really competes on the court. Every coach would like to coach players that have the competitive spirit that a guy like Allen has. But at the same time, you can’t do that. Where does that come from?”  This matter isn’t over, for two reasons. One, we don’t yet know how long Allen will sit out from competition. Duke’s next game is its conference opener Dec. 31 at Virginia Tech. The next two are both at home against beatable ACC opponents, Georgia Tech and Boston College.  The test will be after that: Will Krzyzewski hold Allen out of the Blue Devils’ Jan. 10 matchup with dangerous,   Florida State in Tallahassee? What about the next game  —   at Louisville, which showed its potential by beating Kentucky? That’s what Williams, Krzyzewski’s former guard, called for on ESPN: Five games, which would include the Cardinals. But whenever the suspension ends, the matter won’t be over because Allen will be publicly monitored like few players in his sport ever have been. This entire incident is seen through the prism of Duke’s public persona, which is a generation in the making and predates Allen’s birth.  The villains are a long line of Duke players  —   starting probably with Christian Laettner in the early 1990s but extending to Steve Wojciechowski and Greg Paulus and J. J. Redick and so many others. For so many college basketball fans, Krzyzewski provides the connective tissue, so they notice when he blows off most of the handshake line (as he did last season following a loss to Syracuse) or when he lectures an opponent on sportsmanship (as he did with Oregon’s Dillon Brooks following the Blue Devils’ exit from the NCAA tournament in March).  So before conference play starts, we have the themes of the season clearly defined: How long will Krzyzewski punish Allen? How will Allen conduct himself when he returns  —   and absorbs the unbridled scorn of every opposing crowd? And will villainous Duke become healthy and whole enough for a run at what would be Krzyzewski’s sixth national title. Too bad. Because in the days before Christmas, the theme should be: Wasn’t that   game great? "

","     (This story has been been updated.) Santa may need water skis instead of a sleigh this year. A weather buoy about 90 miles south of the North Pole registered a temperature at the melting point of 32 degrees (0 Celsius) early Thursday, as a giant storm east of Greenland drew abnormally warm air northward. Weather models had predicted temperatures could get this warm and this buoy, part of the North Pole Environmental Observatory, provides validation.  “It seems likely areas very close to or at the North Pole were at the freezing point” Thursday, said Zachary Labe, a doctoral student researching Arctic climate and weather at the University of California at Irvine. Data from the buoy (No. 300234064010010, which can be downloaded here) show that air temperatures have risen more than 40 degrees in the past two days, when they hovered near   degrees (  Celsius) which, even then, was above average.    Temperature near 89N latitude Dec.  . (Data from North Pole Environmental Observatory buoy 300234064010010)  The entire Arctic north of 80 degrees, roughly the size of the Lower 48 states, has witnessed a sharp temperature spike reaching levels   degrees (nearly 20 Celsius) above normal. In reviewing historical records back to 1958, one cannot find a more intense anomaly  —   except following a similar spike just five weeks ago.    Temperature compared to normal in Arctic north of 80N latitude. (Danish Meteorological Institute)  Consider the average temperature in this large region is about   degrees (  Celsius) at this time of year, but had shot up to 12 Thursday. Labe said the huge flux of warmth into the region may have contributed to the loss of sea ice at a time when the region is usually gaining ice. Near the Franz Joseph Islands east of Svalbard, satellite imagery shows a large mass of ice vanishing over the last day. “This is pretty dramatic,” he tweeted.   While   satellite obs for #seaice are noisy, this is a pretty dramatic retreat in the last 24 hours near the Franz Joseph Islands pic. twitter.   —   Zack Labe (@ZLabe) December 22, 2016   Data from the National Snow and Ice Data Center indicate the Arctic lost about 57, 000 square miles of ice (148, 000 square kilometers) in the past day, which is roughly the size of Illinois. Labe cautioned, however, the ice loss data are preliminary and require quality control. In Longyearbyen, Norway, which is on the island of Svalbard in the Nordic Seas, the high reached 36 degrees Thursday, according to Weather Underground, beating the old daily record of 33 degrees. Although it is common for large storms to transport large quantities of heat into the high Arctic, inducing large temperature swings, the intensity of warmth  —   more than 40 degrees above normal  —   has caught the attention of scientists. This is the second time in the past five weeks such a steep rise in temperatures has occurred. In   temperatures averaged over the high Arctic were also about   degrees above normal.  An analysis from Climate Central, a nonprofit science organization, found that a warm event of comparable intensity to what occurred in November “would have been extremely unlikely in a climate of a century ago” before   gases in the atmosphere had grown to current levels.    (Climate Central)  “If nothing is done to slow climate change, by the time global warming reaches 2 degrees Celsius (3. 6 Fahrenheit) events like this winter would become common at the North Pole, happening every few years,” Climate Central concluded. A similar spike to the present also occurred last year, when a buoy near the North Pole also showed temperatures at the melting point. This sharp rise motivated a study in the journal Nature, which concluded that the loss of sea ice in the Arctic over time “is making it easier for weather systems to transport this heat polewards. ”  While the Arctic witnesses freak temperature rises, the cold air normally positioned there has sloshed southward into Siberia. Temperatures there have crashed to about 60 degrees below normal, with air temperatures flirting with  .

","        Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton talks with diners at a popular breakfast spot in Manchester, N. H. on Feb. 6. (Melina   Washington Post)  “If your picture [story] isn’t powerful enough, you aren’t close enough,” said photojournalist Robert Capa. Behind every manufactured scene, there are truthful moments. My job, as a photojournalist covering politics, is to find them. I build a visual narrative within the highly orchestrated landscape created by campaign staffers, but I also work to get access to my subject away from the other cameras, the stage, the crowd. I am looking for the contemplative moment backstage, the concerned whisper between candidate and staff, any moment of serendipity or silliness and stamina. That is how I try to peel away a politician’s facade, frame by frame, day by day. Successful visual storytelling begins with access. My writing colleagues also want access to the primary players, of course, but they can and do report great stories without it, by interviewing other sources. Without access, I’ve got nothing. Establishing that ability to get close requires time, trust, consistency and  . In making a pitch to get access, I always explain that I am trying to create a full portrait over time of the candidate and to tell a complete story of a quest full of ambition, determination and exhaustion. I’ve been covering women striving for political power in America’s boys’ club on both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue for decades, and I offered that body of work as my word in building a relationship with Hillary Clinton and her campaign staff over the past two years. I have witnessed women held to higher standards of performance and behavior. Regardless of party, they are required to do their jobs twice as well as male politicians. Their comportment needs to be motherly but not nagging, inspiring but not too emotional. Their physical appearance needs to be perfect. And their skin? Oh, glowing  —   and as thick as rhino hide (as Eleanor Roosevelt would say). In the two years I was on the trail documenting Hillary Clinton’s bid to become the first female president of the United States, I tried each day to resist falling into the visual malaise of documenting the photo op version of a presidential candidate. I reminded myself to always work to reveal the character of the woman and to scrutinize my shoots for any hint of caricature. My instincts always lead me to explore the reasons, emotions and actions  —   Hillary Clinton embracing a moment late in the campaign, refusing to leave a Florida rally in the driving rain so she could meet more voters. Talking to her staff,   and intent, aboard her campaign plane on the day that FBI Director James B. Comey announced that the FBI would reopen its investigation of Clinton’s use of a private email server. Throwing her head back and letting out her patented,   laugh while putting on a Halloween mask. Each day, as she negotiated the line of “electability,” struggling to show her humanity without losing her credibility as a candidate, I witnessed Hillary Clinton earning every line on her endlessly expressive face.

142416,217881,U.S. declines to veto U.N. Security Council resolution for Israel to stop Jewish settlement activity,Washington Post,Carol Morello,2016-12-23,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161224013837/https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/us-declines-to-veto-un-security-council-resolution-for-israel-to-stop-jewish-settlement-activity/2016/12/23/cd4efe72-c939-11e6-bf4b-2c064d32a4bf_story.html
"," The U. N. Security Council on Friday passed a resolution demanding that Israel cease Jewish settlement activity on Palestinian territory in a unanimous vote that passed when the United States abstained rather than using its veto as it has reliably done in the past. The resolution declares settlements constructed on land Israel has occupied since the 1967 war, including in East Jerusalem, to have “no legal validity. ” It said settlements threaten the viability of the   solution, and it urged Israelis and Palestinians to return to negotiations that will lead to two independent nations. The United States’ abstention Friday was a rare rebuke to Israel, and it reflected mounting frustration in the Obama administration over settlement growth that the United States considers an obstacle to peace. With President Obama’s time in office due to end in barely a month, his decision not to veto was a   symbolic statement of that displeasure and a sense of exasperation that the time has come for two states to be carved out of the contested land. The administration’s move also defied Donald Trump’s call on Thursday for the United States to veto the resolution. The incoming Trump administration has signaled that there will be a shift in U. S. policy toward Israel, a point the   hammered home about an hour after Friday’s vote when he tweeted, “As to the U. N. things will be different after Jan. 20th. ”  Trump has supported moving the U. S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. He has appointed David Friedman, a bankruptcy lawyer who believes Israelis should annex and settle the West Bank, as the next U. S. ambassador to Israel.       (Reuters)    It is unclear what, if any, impact this resolution will have. Resolutions reflect the opinion and will of the 15 members of the Security Council, but legal scholars differ about how binding they are. And Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has insisted that Israel will not abide by the terms of the settlements resolution. About 400, 000 Jews live in roughly 150 settlements in the West Bank on land that the Palestinians want for a future state east of the line formed after the 1967 war. An additional 200, 000 Israelis live in East Jerusalem, which Palestinians want to become the capital of their future state. Many Israelis consider the settlements to be in the ancestral homeland of the Jews and refer to them by their biblical names, Judea and Samaria. Most nations consider the settlements illegal. U. S. diplomats characterize them as illegitimate and say they exacerbate tensions between Israelis and the Palestinians who live nearby, thereby undercutting efforts to advance peace. Twice, the Obama administration has made concerted attempts to broker peace negotiations between the Israelis and Palestinians. The most recent, involving nine months of intense diplomacy by Secretary of State John F. Kerry, collapsed in 2014, and nothing has been able to revive the talks.  Throughout the year, the administration has been increasingly vocal in its exasperation. The State Department has issued several sharp criticisms of settlement construction, in July calling it “provocative and counterproductive. ” Since then, more than 2, 600 housing units have been built in settlements.  Still, the United States agreed this year to provide Israel with $38 billion in military aid over 10 years, the largest such package ever. U. S. and Israeli officials both have said security and military cooperation between the two countries has remained excellent, even when Obama and Netanyahu have clashed. The international community has shown increasing impatience with the intractability of the    conflict. Proposals have been put forth in the last year by Egypt, France, and a group made up of the European Union, the United Nations, Russia and the United States. Israel has blamed the impasse on Palestinian refusal to recognize the legitimacy of Israel as a Jewish state. Palestinians blame Israel for occupying lands they consider rightfully theirs. The    vote, with only the United States abstaining, followed an intense campaign from Israel to derail it. It was to have been voted on Thursday, but Egypt withdrew its sponsorship after the country’s president spoke by phone with Trump, who got involved at Israel’s request. Friday’s resolution was sponsored by New Zealand, Malaysia, Venezuela and Senegal. The resolution’s passage brought a swift reaction, particularly in Israel and in Congress.  Netanyahu said Friday that he welcomed Trump replacing Obama, whose administration, he said, had “colluded” in a diplomatic assault on Israel. “Israel rejects this shameful    resolution at the UN and will not abide by its terms,” Netanyahu said in a statement released by his office. “The Obama administration not only failed to protect Israel against this   at the UN, it colluded with it behind the scenes. ” “This is absolutely shameful,” House Speaker Paul D. Ryan ( .) said in a statement, promising that next year “our unified Republican government will work to reverse the damage done by this administration, and rebuild our alliance with Israel. ” But Palestinian diplomats called the resolution a chance to salvage the possibility of two states and exulted in seeing the U. N. pass a resolution reflecting their views. “After years of allowing the law to be trampled and the situation to spiral downward, today’s resolution may rightly be seen as a last attempt to preserve the   solution and revive the path for peace,” Riyad Mansour, the Palestinian ambassador to the United Nations, said Friday.  Kerry said he would speak more in the coming days about the U. N. vote and “the way ahead” for Israel and the Palestinians. “That future is now in jeopardy, with terrorism, violence and incitement continuing and unprecedented steps to expand settlements being advanced by avowed opponents of the   solution,” Kerry said. “That is why we cannot in good conscience stand in the way of a resolution at the United Nations that makes clear that both sides must act now to preserve the possibility of peace. ” Friday’s resolution also condemned Palestinian incitement to violence and all acts of terrorism. Samantha Power, the U. S. ambassador to the United Nations, said the United States would not have allowed its passage without that proviso. She also criticized the United Nations itself, saying it had perpetuated a double standard by repeatedly condemning Israeli actions while remaining silent about Palestinian incitement. In the hours before the vote, Israeli media reported harsh criticism toward Obama and Kerry coming from an unnamed official in Netanyahu’s office. The office accused them of having “abandoned” Israel by refusing the block the resolution with a veto. White House deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes said Friday that the administration’s pursuit of a   solution is “guided by our belief that it is the only way to preserve Israel’s security in the long run. ”  “President Obama has done more for Israel and its security than any previous U. S. president,” Rhodes told reporters.  That argument did not assuage Israeli anger at the U. S. decision not to veto the resolution, a decision the Obama administration still had not shared with the Israeli government a few hours before the vote. According to an Israeli official who spoke on the condition on anonymity because the conversations were private, a White House official told an Israeli official Thursday that the United States is Israel’s best friend. The Israeli replied, “Friends don’t take friends to the Security Council. ”  Eglash reported from Jerusalem. Karoun Demirjian and David Nakamura contributed to this report. "

","  JERUSALEM  —   Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke out forcefully against a U. N. Security Council resolution on Friday that condemns Israeli settlements, calling it “shameful” and saying that Israel would not abide by its terms. The resolution criticizes Israel’s settlement activity in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, areas that the Palestinians hope will be a future state, and says the settlements “altered the demographic composition, character and status of the Palestinian territory occupied since 1967. ” The resolution passed with 14 votes to 0. The United States, in a break with tradition, decided to abstain from the vote.  “The Obama administration not only failed to protect Israel against this   at the U. N. it colluded with it behind the scenes,” Netanyahu wrote in a strongly worded statement, which was unusually released on the Jewish Sabbath eve. Netanyahu and President Obama have had a strained relationship, especially over the issue of Israeli settlements. Hours before the U. N. Security Council met to discuss the resolution, Israeli media reported that an anonymous Israeli official had accused Obama and U. S. Secretary of State John F. Kerry of scheming behind Israel’s back to push the resolution through.      (Reuters)   The resolution, initially brought by the Egyptians, had been scheduled for a vote Thursday. Israeli pressure and a push from   Donald Trump caused the Egyptians to table it. It was revived Friday by other members of the Security Council.  Immediately after the vote, Netanyahu ordered a series of diplomatic steps against countries that   the resolution and with whom Israel has diplomatic relations. He instructed Israel’s ambassadors in New Zealand and Senegal to return to Israel immediately and canceled the Senegalese foreign minister’s planned visit to Israel. He also canceled Israeli aid programs in Senegal. In his statement, Netanyahu also said he looked forward to working with Trump. Since the election, Netanyahu and his ministers have refrained from making public statements about Trump, but subtle words and gestures have suggested that the Israeli leadership is buoyed by the new administration. So far, Trump has indicated he might approach the   conflict in a different manner than Obama. Last week, he nominated his close adviser, New York lawyer David Friedman, an outspoken supporter of Israel’s settlements, as the ambassador to Israel.      (Reuters)    About 400, 000 Jewish settlers live on 125 settlements and 100 outposts in the   West Bank. Over the past six months, Israel has announced plans to add hundreds of units to existing settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. At the same time,   voices in Netanyahu’s government are pushing for legislation that would legalize settlements built on privately owned Palestinian land. Energy Minister Yuval Steinitz said on Israeli TV that the resolution was not only   but also against Israel and Jews in general. “The heart aches after eight years of friendship and cooperation with Obama,” he said. “The U. N. Security Council can’t make a decision on Syria, but on this issue, the U. S. Obama and John Kerry allow it to pass. ” Israel’s ambassador to the United Nations, Danny Danon, expressed disappointment that the United States had not used its veto power in the Security Council to stop the resolution. “It was to be expected that Israel’s greatest ally would act in accordance with the values that we share and that they would have vetoed this disgraceful resolution,” he said. “I have no doubt that the new U. S. administration and the incoming U. N. secretary general will usher in a new era in terms of the U. N.’s relationship with Israel. ” The Palestinians called the U. N. approval of the resolution “a victory. ” Saeb Erekat, a former peace negotiator and the No. 2 in the Palestine Liberation Organization, said the vote was a “clear and unanimous message” to Netanyahu that “your policies will not achieve peace and security for Israel or the region. ” “The only way to peace is through the creation of an independent Palestinian state, and this is what the international community agreed upon today at the Security Council,” he said.

142418,217883,It’s mostly kumbaya so far for Trump and GOP in Congress,Washington Post,Mike DeBonis,2016-12-23,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161224013837/https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/its-mostly-kumbaya-so-far-for-trump-and-gop-in-congress/2016/12/23/49b9b54e-c870-11e6-85b5-76616a33048d_story.html
","   Donald Trump is signaling a   in his battle with the Republican leadership in Congress, which he repeatedly skewered during his   attacks on the Washington establishment.  Trump has, by all accounts, patched up his   relationship with House Speaker Paul D. Ryan ( . ). To fill top jobs in his administration, Trump has chosen five sitting lawmakers, as well as the wife of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell ( . ). And he has passed up opportunities to meddle in congressional business in ways that might have pleased his populist base but frustrated Republican leaders. The detente in Trump’s war on GOP leaders reflects the unifying power of victory, the moderating influence of Vice   Mike Pence and incoming White House chief of staff Reince Priebus, and, most of all, a shared desire to make good on years of Republican campaign promises. “He has made it clear he does not want to be an   president, like Obama,” said Rep. Chris Collins ( . Y.) who was one of the first lawmakers to openly back Trump and now serves on the transition’s executive committee. “He wants to be a legislative president, who gets legislation on his desk to sign into law. ”  Top leaders and their staffs have developed a relationship with Trump’s more   aides  —   Priebus and campaign manager Kellyanne Conway, who will serve as a White House counselor. Ryan has a particularly strong bond with Pence, forged during their 12 years together in the House. But other Trump aides are nurturing different channels of communication that could exacerbate GOP tensions.   House conservatives appear to have a direct line to Trump chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon and senior political aide David Bossie  —   both of whom spent years in the conservative media railing against the GOP establishment. Other Republicans  —   including a group of early Trump backers from New York and Pennsylvania  —   are closer to Trump family members, including    Jared Kushner, who is playing a central transition role and could join the White House officially. Trump is in   contact with Ryan and McConnell, mainly to solicit input on potential appointees, while   transition staffers hash out a legislative blueprint for 2017 with senior congressional aides  —   one that would repeal Obamacare, rewrite the federal tax code and rebuild domestic infrastructure. But the   choreography can only extend so far. Big questions remain about Trump’s personal approach to Congress: Will he be a bipartisan schmoozer and dealmaker? Or will he sit back as Republicans power through a   wish list? Trump has yet to commit to attending the yearly House Republican policy retreat scheduled for late January in Philadelphia  —   a traditional early stop for a new president. A Trump spokesman declined to comment for this article. But it is clear that the members of Trump’s inner circle often are not on the same page, which could spell trouble for his legislative agenda. For instance, members of the   House Freedom Caucus claimed to have Trump’s backing when they defied Ryan and launched an   bid to impeach Internal Revenue Service Commissioner John Koskinen. Priebus intervened in an attempt to halt a floor vote, as reported by Politico, but conservatives forced one anyway. The Freedom Caucus was emboldened  —   and encouraged behind the scenes  —   by Bannon, whose former website, Breitbart, wrote favorably about it, and by Bossie, who supported the impeachment push as president of Citizens United. Impeachment was effectively buried in the end, handing GOP leaders the win. Even as Trump has moved closer to the Republican leadership, not all key decisions are going its way. A top GOP leader got an   lesson on the competing whims of Trump insiders. Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers ( .) the House Republican Conference chairwoman, was personally wooed for a Cabinet position by Pence, and on Dec. 9, a Friday, several media organizations reported that Trump had chosen her as interior secretary. But McMorris Rodgers was never offered the job ahead of a planned visit to Trump Tower the following Monday. On her way up to Trump’s   office, according to a person familiar with the visit, her elevator stopped and she was joined by Trump’s sons Eric and Donald Jr.  —   the latter holding a folder of documents. The sons then entered their father’s office ahead of McMorris Rodgers before she was ushered in. After small talk about that weekend’s   football game, the person said, Trump opened the folder and questioned McMorris Rodgers on statements she had made criticizing Trump during the campaign. The meeting ended within minutes. They next day, Trump announced he had selected Rep. Ryan Zinke ( .) a former Navy SEAL who got to know Donald Trump Jr. through hunting and fishing circles. Trump’s eschewing of McMorris Rodgers and choice of Zinke was a blow to GOP leaders, especially McConnell, who saw Zinke as Republicans’ best chance to unseat Sen. Jon Tester ( .) in 2018. Rep. Tom Cole (Okla.) the veteran House Republican, said the competing factions inside Trump’s inner circle could help him manage a fractious Congress. Different wings of the party, he said, could interact with the White House through different advisers and feel comfortable their views were being heard by Trump. “There can be creative chaos sometimes in administrations,” he said. “This is probably not unlike the way he runs a lot of businesses. . . . He probably seems to like that, likes a little tension in the Cabinet or disagreements with his advisers, because it clarifies the issues in front of him and then he makes the decision. ” Stylistically, Trump seems to be charting a different course toward lawmakers than President Obama, who was criticized for his seemingly aloof personal relations with them. Trump is embracing a more   approach  —   one that has played out in   phone calls, text messages and highly publicized visits to Trump Tower. “I probably talked to him as much since he’s become   as I did [to Obama] in the entire eight years,” said Sen. Joe Manchin III, a moderate West Virginia Democrat who was in contention for energy secretary. Manchin said he left a Trump Tower visit earlier this month with Trump’s direct phone number and budding relationships with Priebus and Bannon, both of whom Manchin praised. “I liked him,” Manchin said of Bannon, a bete noire to most Democrats. “He’s no     straightforward, direct. . . . You might not agree, but at least you know where he’s coming from. ” Priebus, he said, “wants to do some things to move things forward. ” Those relationships are being built, several lawmakers pointed out, even before Trump takes office and has use of some of the most powerful tools of persuasion. “Say what you want about the trappings of the White House and Air Force One and those kinds of things, but some presidents have used that stuff very effectively,” said Rep. Kevin Cramer ( . D.) another early Trump backer, now advising the transition on energy issues. “Donald Trump, with his background in hospitality, as a host, owning facilities, being in the business, he’s the kind of guy who can maximize the tools of relationship probably as well as anybody could. ” Cole said Trump’s   style suggests Congress will not be kept at arm’s length. “A lot of it seems to be in interactive situations with individuals, which of course is what congressmen want to do: They want to talk about what they know and what they do,” Cole said. “My guess is the Trump White House is going to be an interesting White House to visit. You’re going to be invited down a lot more. ” Senior Capitol Hill staffers say they are waiting for Trump to weigh in on key questions before committing to strategies on health care, infrastructure and taxes. But even among Trump’s strongest congressional supporters, there are differing views on how involved Trump ultimately will get in dictating legislation. “I think we know he’s not going to get himself wrapped around the axles,” Cramer said. “As long as we’re delivering the product that gets to his goals, I think that he would defer the details to us. ” Collins, on the other hand, said Ryan and McConnell understand that the GOP is Trump’s party now and that he will ultimately call the shots. “There’s been no kickback whatsoever that would suggest, ‘We’re Congress. You’re the president. We’re going to do what we’re going to do,’ ” Collins said. “It’s just the opposite. It’s, ‘Yes, Mr. President. What do you want us to do first? How would you like us to proceed? Thank you very much.’ ”  "

"," Donald Trump’s sudden embrace this week of a nuclear arms race  —   and his staff’s scramble to minimize the fallout  —   underscored an emerging modus operandi for the  : governance by chaos. Since winning the election, Trump has seemed to revel in tossing firecrackers in all directions, often using Twitter to offer brief but provocative pronouncements on foreign and domestic policies alike  —   and leaving it to others to flesh out his true intentions. In the past week alone, Trump has publicly pitted two military contractors against each other, sowed confusion about the scope of his proposed ban on foreign Muslims, and needled China after its seizure of a U. S. underwater drone. But nothing has created more consternation for many foreign policy experts than Trump’s assertion Thursday on Twitter that the country should “greatly strengthen and expand” its nuclear capability. On Friday, after his staff had tried to temper his comments, Trump doubled down  —   telling a television   host that in an arms race against any competitor, the United States would “outmatch them at every pass. ”      (Peter   Washington Post)   Trump has pledged to shake up both Washington and the world order, and boosters argue that a degree of unpredictability can be useful, particularly when it comes to foreign policy. But the mixed messages and erratic nature of his pronouncements have alarmed even some Republicans, who say it’s important to know how seriously to take the leader of the free world. “We’re just operating in this world where you cannot believe the things he says,” said Eliot Cohen, a foreign policy expert and former George W. Bush administration official at the State Department. “It will have large consequences for our allies and our adversaries, and it’s going to greatly magnify the danger of miscalculation by all kinds of people. ”  Trump’s team has struggled with the new resonance that becoming   has given Trump’s Twitter habit. They have repeatedly said that his statements on social media do not necessarily reflect his official policy and have at times sought to play down the import of his actions. But Trump supporters say the rest of Washington is going to have to get used to his more freewheeling style. “People who expect the past are going to be shocked that there’s a new way of doing things,” said Barry Bennett, a Republican strategist who served as an adviser to Trump during the   campaign. “This is a glimpse of where he’s headed, and in a way, it’s highly transparent, but just not the way Washington has done business for the past 40 or 50 years. ”  But others warn that Democrats and Republicans alike on Capitol Hill could have a hard time reading Trump and discerning his true priorities if he continues to operate as he has during the transition. “It’s difficult to separate the wheat from the chaff  —   what comes out that he really wants and what’s just said at the spur of the moment,” said Jim Manley, a former longtime aide to Senate Minority Leader Harry M. Reid ( . ). “In the past, a   doing something like this would have been unfathomable. ” The imbroglio over nuclear arms began Thursday with a tweet from Trump in which he said the United States “must greatly strengthen and expand its nuclear capability until such time as the world comes to its senses regarding nukes. ” Trump made no mention of what spurred his thoughts, but the tweet followed an address by Russian President Vladi mir Putin in which he said his country’s nuclear stockpile needs fortifying. Trump’s tweet seemed to signal a break with four decades of policy charted by presidents of both parties  —   and it sent his staff scrambling to explain his thinking.  In a television interview Thursday night, Kellyanne Conway  —   named counselor to the president earlier in the day  —   played down its sweep. “He’s not trying to change a policy through Twitter,” Conway told MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow. “What he’s merely saying is that he wants us to be ready to defend ourselves. ” Conway said Trump’s tweet was not necessarily aimed at Russia but directed at “a regime that would do us harm or a rogue nation. ” Trump was not backing down Friday morning, however. On MSNBC’s “Morning Joe,”   Mika Brzezinski relayed a conversation she had with Trump in which he reportedly said, “Let it be an arms race. We will outmatch them at every pass. ”  As they discussed Trump’s nuclear vow, Brzezinski and host Joe Scarborough, a former congressman from Florida, were both dressed in pajamas as they sat in front of a fireplace on their final show before Christmas. Shortly after the segment aired, Sean Spicer, who was named Trump’s White House press secretary on Thursday, suggested that Trump was describing a hypothetical situation and speaking about what would happen if other countries don’t “come to their senses. ” “If another country wants to expand their nuclear capability, the U. S. is not going to sit back and idly by,” Spicer said on NBC’s “Today” show. “But just to be clear: The president isn’t saying we’re going to do this. He said unless they come to their senses. It’s a warning to them that this president’s going to take action. ” Democrats, meanwhile, chided Trump for being cavalier about a topic as sensitive as nuclear weapons.  Taking to Twitter himself, Sen. Bernie Sanders ( .) wrote Friday afternoon that “Congress must not allow the Tweeter in Chief to unleash a dangerous and costly nuclear arms race. ” Rep. Adam Schiff ( .) tweeted: “Dear Donald Trump. You’re new to this so here’s a list of things to tweet about instead of nuclear weapons. 1.) Literally anything. ” In an interview, Schiff said that in his view, “this just isn’t a way to conduct business, certainly not as president or  . It’s dangerous. ”  Doug Wilson, a former assistant secretary of defense for public affairs in the Obama administration, said it remained unclear to him and many others in the national security establishment what Trump was trying to convey. “I’m not sure if he’s talking about expanding the nuclear arsenal or he’s mistaken that for modernizing the nuclear force,” Wilson said. Wilson said that there can be foreign policy advantages to being unpredictable but that “there is a difference in being strategically unpredictable and foolishly unpredictable. ” He said it’s too early to know in which camp to place Trump. On a range of other issues during the campaign and in recent weeks, Trump has made statements that his aides have immediately walked back or softened. In a brief appearance before reporters this week, Trump seemed to suggest that two of his most controversial campaign proposals  —   to ban foreign Muslims from entering the United States and to register those who are here  —   had been vindicated by recent terrorist attacks in Europe. Later, Conway insisted that a ban on Muslims was no longer Trump’s plan. After meeting this week with the chief executives of two of the largest defense contractors, Boeing and Lockheed Martin, Trump announced on Twitter that he had asked Boeing to price out the cost of an   fighter jet  —   which could replace the   jet developed by Lockheed Martin due to cost overruns. The tweet sent Boeing’s stock up and Lockheed Martin’s stock plummeting  —   shaving about $1. 2 billion off the company’s value. Some conservatives praised Trump for using his platform to pursue cost savings for taxpayers. But on foreign affairs in particular, experts warned that Twitter is not the best venue to pursue new policy  —   even if the aim is disruption. Thomas Nichols, a U. S. Naval War College professor who is currently writing a book on U. S. nuclear policy, noted that Trump and his staff have now offered multiple explanations for what he meant in his nuclear weapons tweet. “It’s worse than not having one explanation,” said Nichols, who said he was speaking in his personal capacity. “If you’re going to change policy, then that requires a kind of steely consistency and a lot of disciplined messaging. ” “We’re all spending a lot of time,” he added, “trying to devise the future of America’s nuclear policy out of 140 characters. ” "
142420,217885,"For women, heavy drinking has been normalized. That’s dangerous.",Washington Post,Kimberly Kindy,2016-12-23,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161224013837/https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/for-women-heavy-drinking-has-been-normalized-thats-dangerous/2016/12/23/0e701120-c381-11e6-9578-0054287507db_story.html
","          UNNATURAL CAUSES | SICK AND DYING IN   AMERICA:  Since the turn of this century, death rates have risen for whites in midlife, particularly women. In this series, The Washington Post is exploring this trend and the forces driving it.  The ads started popping up about a decade ago on social media. Instead of selling alcohol with sex and romance, these ads had an edgier theme: Harried mothers chugging wine to cope with everyday stress. Women embracing   bottles of whiskey, and bellying up to bars to knock back vodka shots with men. In this new strain of advertising, women’s liberation equaled heavy drinking, and alcohol researchers say it both heralded and promoted a profound cultural shift: Women in America are drinking far more, and far more frequently, than their mothers or grandmothers did, and alcohol consumption is killing them in record numbers.    White women are particularly likely to drink dangerously, with more than a quarter drinking multiple times a week and the share of binge drinking up 40 percent since 1997, according to a Washington Post analysis of federal health data. In 2013, more than a million women of all races wound up in emergency rooms as a result of heavy drinking, with women in middle age most likely to suffer severe intoxication. This behavior has contributed to a startling increase in early mortality. The rate of    deaths for white women ages 35 to 54 has more than doubled since 1999, according to The Post analysis, accounting for 8 percent of deaths in this age group in 2015.    “It is a looming health crisis,” said Katherine M. Keyes, an alcohol researcher at Columbia University. Although federal health officials and independent researchers are increasingly convinced that even moderate drinking poses health risks, American women are still receiving mixed messages. Parts of the federal government continue to advance the idea that moderate drinking may be good for you. The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, a division of the National Institutes of Health, is overseeing a new $100 million study, largely funded by the alcohol industry, that seeks to test the possible health benefits of moderate drinking. Meanwhile, many ads for alcohol  —   particularly on social media  —   appear to promote excessive drinking, which is universally recognized as potentially deadly. These ads also appear to violate the industry’s code of ethics, according to a Post analysis of alcohol marketing. For example, when   heroine Amy Schumer guzzled Bandit boxed wine in the movie “Trainwreck,” Bandit’s producer, Trinchero Family Estates, promoted the scene on social media. Young women responded with photos of themselves chugging Bandit. Within months, Trinchero said, sales of boxed wines  —   sometimes called “binge in a box”  —   jumped 22 percent. “We saw it first with tobacco, marketing it to women as their right to smoke. Then we saw lung cancer deaths surpass deaths from breast cancer,” said Rear Adm. Susan Blumenthal, a former U. S. assistant surgeon general and an expert on women’s health issues. “Now it’s happening with alcohol, and it’s become an equal rights tragedy. ” Alcohol marketing is regulated primarily by industry trade groups, but dozens of studies have found lapses in their record of enforcing the rules. As a result, an international group of public health experts convened by the World Health Organization’s regional office in Washington, D. C. plans to call in January for governments worldwide to consider legislation similar to laws adopted a decade ago to sharply curtail tobacco advertising. “The industry’s system of   is broken,” said Thomas F. Babor, a professor at the University of Connecticut School of Medicine who is aiding the effort. “The alternatives are clear: Either you have to take their system and put it into independent hands, or you have to go with a partial or full legal ban on alcohol marketing. ”  Officials with the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States (DISCUS) one of the largest U. S. trade groups, defend their record of oversight, saying it has received high marks from federal regulators. “The Council’s Code of Responsible Practices sets more stringent standards than those mandated by law or regulation, or that might be imposed by government due to First Amendment constraints,” council Senior Vice President Frank Coleman said. DISCUS tells members that ads should not “in any way suggest that intoxication is socially acceptable conduct. ” The Beer Institute tells members that their “marketing materials should not depict situations where beer is being consumed rapidly, excessively. ” And the Wine Institute prohibits ads that make “any suggestion that excessive drinking or loss of control is amusing or a proper subject for amusement” or that directly associate use of wine with “social, physical or personal problem solving. ” But these rules appear regularly to be flouted, particularly on alcohol companies’ websites and    feeds, which are soaking up a growing share of the more than $2 billion the industry is expected to spend on advertising this year. And the trade groups acknowledge that they do not investigate or act on possible violations unless they receive a formal complaint.    A woman samples a bottle of wine at a festival in Raleigh, N. C. Companies are gearing promotions to target women, with much of the edgiest marketing appearing on social media. (Bonnie Jo   Washington Post)  Normalizing drinking Some of the edgiest ads appear on social media  —   Facebook, Twitter, Instagram  —   where they can be narrowly targeted toward the inboxes of the most eager consumers. “They can be very specific,” Facebook spokeswoman Annie Demarest said. “The ads could go to married women ages 21 to 60 who read about wine and leisure. They can also target the ads based on location, interests, demographics, behaviors and connections. ” Jokes about becoming inebriated are common. One Twitter ad features a woman with a bottle the size of a refrigerator tilted toward her lips. Its contents: Fireball Cinnamon Whisky. Women also are frequently shown drinking to cope with daily stress. In one image that appeared on a company website, two white women wearing prim,   hats, button earrings and    hair confer side by side. “How much do you spend on a bottle of wine?” one asks. The other answers, “I would guess about half an hour . . . ” At the bottom is the name of the wine: Mommy’s Time Out. Another ad on a company website features a white woman wearing pearls and an apron. “The most expensive part of having kids is all the wine you have to drink,” it says above the name of the wine: Mad Housewife. This spring, Mad Housewife offered a Mother’s Day promotion: a   of wine called Mommy’s Little Helper.    Mommy’s Time Out and Mad Housewife are two wines that are marketed toward women. (Bonnie Jo   Washington Post)  The trend extends to    housewares. A flask promoted on the Mad Housewife site features two women from the “Mad Men” era asking, “Who is this ‘Moderation’ we’re supposed to be drinking with?” An ad on the Etsy marketplace website promotes a stemmed glass big enough to hold an entire bottle of wine with the line: “She will be telling the truth when she says ‘I only had 1 glass.’ ” And Urban Outfitters  —   a retailer that markets to   to     —   stocks   wine glasses that say: “Drink until your dreams come true” and “This is how you adult. ” Urban Outfitters did not respond to calls and emailed messages. Alcohol marketing experts see a feedback loop between alcohol advertising and popular culture. They cite Trinchero’s repurposing of Schumer’s scene in “Trainwreck” as a prominent example. “The rise in hazardous drinking among women is not all due to the ads. But the ads have played a role in creating a cultural climate that says it’s funny when women drink heavily,” said Jean Kilbourne, who has produced several films and books about alcohol marketing to women. “Most importantly, they’ve played a role in normalizing it. ”  Multiple experts on alcohol marketing said Trinchero’s use of the scene to promote its wine violated industry standards. Wendy Nyberg, Trinchero’s marketing vice president, defended the company’s behavior, saying Trinchero officials had no role in the production of “Trainwreck” and no control over how their wine was portrayed. It’s “easier when you control the messaging,” she said, adding: “We have to promote moderation in everything that we do. We stick to the code of ethics. ”  The owner of Mommy’s Time Out did not respond to requests for comment, and marketing promotions sent to the company for a response have been removed from the company’s public Facebook page. Damian Davis, the owner of the   Rainier Wine, which produces Mad Housewife, said he does not think his ads crossed a line. “We treat wine like a lifestyle product. I grew up in a big Catholic family, and having it with dinner was a way of life,” Davis said. “I certainly don’t encourage binge drinking. It certainly is a drug, and it can be dangerous. ” Even responsible drinking campaigns can send conflicting messages. A Facebook ad for Smirnoff Ice  —   ranked among the five most popular beverages by young female drinkers  —   shows a stack of caps from four   bottles. The tagline: “Know Your Limit. ”    “That’s binge drinking,” said David Jernigan, who runs the Center for Alcohol Marketing and Youth at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore. Jernigan, who advocates limits on alcohol marketing and has come under frequent attack from the alcohol industry, uses the Smirnoff ad in a presentation he calls “Virginia Slims in a Bottle. ” “Not only is that not responsible drinking,” he said. “That’s hazardous drinking. ” In a statement, Diageo, the maker of Smirnoff Ice, defended the ad, saying that by “saving the bottle caps, you keep track of how much you have had. Each individual has their own individual limits and for each individual these limits can vary based on time period of consumption, food intake and many other factors. ” Officials with Fireball Whisky declined to comment. ‘No gender equity’ As it happens, drinking can be especially hazardous for women. Women tend to have smaller bodies than men, and differences in physiology that make    levels climb faster and stay elevated longer. Some studies have found that women have lower levels of the stomach enzymes needed to process the toxins in alcoholic beverages. As a result, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, women are more prone to suffer brain atrophy, heart disease and liver damage. Even if a woman stops drinking, liver disease continues to progress in ways it does not in men, said Gyongyi Szabo, a professor at the University of Massachusetts Medical School. And research definitively shows that women who drink have an increased risk of breast cancer. “There is no gender equity when it comes to the effects of alcohol on men versus women,” Szabo said. “Females are more susceptible to the unwanted biological effects of alcohol when they consume the same amount of alcohol and at the same frequency  —   even when you adjust for weight. ” Many women don’t know this  —   nor do they understand what constitutes excessive drinking, said Robert D. Brewer, leader of the CDC’s alcohol program. For women in the United States, anything more than one drink a day is considered excessive. That’s one ounce of distilled spirits, 12 ounces of beer or five ounces of wine. Four drinks consumed within two hours is considered binge drinking. That’s about   of a bottle of wine. “Most people do not understand what binge drinking looks like, and they don’t yet recognize how dangerous it is,” Brewer said. “Smoking, eating unhealthy foods, not exercising  —   people get what that can do to your health. But we are in a way different stage with binge drinking. ”    Women sample and drink wine at a festival in Raleigh, N. C. Women consume the majority of wine in the United States. (Bonnie Jo   Washington Post)  The alcohol industry and some government agencies continue to promote the idea that moderate drinking provides some health benefits. But new research is beginning to call even that   claim into question. This year, Jennie Connor, a professor at the University of Otago Dunedin School of Medicine in New Zealand, published a paper that found “strong evidence” that drinking as little as two servings of alcohol a day can cause cancer at seven sites in the body  —   mostly in areas where human cells come in direct contact with alcohol. Connor’s research included a survey of dozens of studies of the issue by prominent organizations, including the World Cancer Research Fund, the American Institute for Cancer Research and the International Agency for Research on Cancer.  In an earlier paper examining alcohol and cancer in the New Zealand population, Connor found that about a third of   cancer deaths among women were associated with less than two standard drinks per day.  About the time this work was appearing, DISCUS chief scientist Samir Zakhari produced research casting doubt on its validity. Zakhari also wrote an opinion piece directly attacking Connor’s study, using earlier research to dispute her findings. Connor fired back at Zakhari in an   published in a New Zealand newspaper, noting that Zakhari relied on  —   and misrepresented  —   her own earlier research. “The author cites Health Promotion Agency research showing how wrong I am,” she wrote. “If he had opened the report, he would have discovered that I wrote it. ”  Zakhari scheduled and then canceled an interview with The Post to discuss his criticism of Connor and other alcohol researchers. “I occasionally write   or letters to the editor, most often in response to news coverage that contains flawed science,” he ultimately said in a statement. The CDC’s Brewer, however, said that Connor’s research  —   and other recent work highlighting the health risks of drinking  —   is persuasive.  “The current and emerging science does not support the purported benefits of moderate drinking,” Brewer said. “The risk of death from cancer appears to go up with any level of alcohol consumption. “The guidelines talk about   consumption, but there is no such thing. ”  Julie Tate contributed to this report.

"," For 73 years  —   through wars in Europe and Asia and civil rights battles at home, through the assassination of a president and the rise of     —   they shared a bed. He’d be gone sometimes, flying missions during World War II and the Korean and Vietnam wars, but he always came back to her. So now, as he lies in a hospital bed unable to say or do much, she lies beside him. Like many hospitals, Fort Belvoir Community Hospital, where retired Army Col. George Morris, 94, is receiving    care, allows family members to sleep in a patient’s room on a foldout couch. But for George’s wife, Eloise, 91, a cancer survivor who has suffered two broken hips and a broken shoulder, that would be hard. So the hospital made a special exception when they admitted him this month: They admitted her as a patient, too  —   a “compassionate admission,” their doctor calls it. Standard rooms are normally private, but Eloise’s hospital bed was rolled in and pushed up against George’s  —   a final marriage berth for a husband and wife who met as teenagers in rural Kentucky in the late 1930s. He spotted her first. “I was a sophomore in high school and I’d gone to see a play in a country school,” said Eloise, sitting up in her reclining bed, a birdlike woman in oversize bifocals whose hair is hardly touched by gray. George rested in his bed beside her. “He saw me and went home and told his mother, ‘I just met the girl I’m going to marry.’ He said, ‘I looked her over real well and I couldn’t find anything wrong with her but one crooked tooth.’ ” A movie date and a picnic followed. Eloise can’t recall the movie  —   she was too distracted by the thrill of holding his hand in the dark. The picnic, however, was unforgettable. “Here comes George and he had something in his hand with a crank on the end and I wondered what this was. ” It was something she’d never seen before  —   a portable phonograph, and when he turned the crank it started playing “Sweet Eloise,” a popular song at the time. He turned that crank all afternoon. “Oh, I thought that was great. ” The town of Russell Springs, Ky. where she lived on a farm, was eight miles from Columbia, where he lived. He didn’t have a car, so he’d walk the distance to see her. By 15 she was wearing an engagement ring and had no doubts about what she was doing. “He had thick eyebrows and devilish eyes, and I hadn’t seen any guys my way that ” she said. “I thought that he was more intelligent than any man I’d ever met. ” They married and had two sons and a German shepherd who played outfield in family softball games. After stints in Tokyo and Alaska, they eventually settled in Annandale, Va. Those legendary eyebrows are wispy now, the devilish eyes   as he lies beside a tray of juice and apple sauce. But every now and then as she spoke he chimed in, his voice rising alongside hers like an echo. “We had some lean times but some great times,” she said. “We didn’t have a lot of material things, but we could sure have a sweet time. There was lots of love around. George could always make me feel so protected. ” It was a stark contrast from her youth  —   her father left her mother before she was born, and she grew up an only child, helping her mother and grandparents tend to the sheep and cows and chickens. As partners, the two complemented each other. “He was  . I don’t mean  . But his father would say, ‘Eloise knows how to make George think he’s boss.’ Some people might call that tricky, but I know how to keep people happy. I know how to keep George thinking that he’s making the decisions. ” Being married to an airman had its challenges. He took her up once in a   Mustang fighter plane and it nearly killed her. “I couldn’t hear and I was very sick to my stomach. When he did the roll, that was fine, but when he did the loop, well, I kind of blacked out and my mouth opened and I just couldn’t stand it. ” George had a lot of friends who didn’t come back from the wars. During Vietnam, “he said one of the saddest things was when he brought the dead soldiers home  —   he said that was heartbreaking because they were so young. ” He retired in the 1970s. The secret to seven decades of love? “Be happy, whether you’re happy or not. Laugh. ” Like they did the time they were posted somewhere new and they arrived before their belongings  —   including their sheets and pillows. “We cut up the newspaper and put our heads on one duffle bag, and every time we moved, the paper in it would rattle and we laughed all night,” she said, grinning. “We really, really loved each other. We were lonely, lonely when we were apart, and when he’d come home, it was just heaven. ” Their sons have since died  —   the older one three or four years ago, the younger one several months ago  —   and most of their grandchildren,   and a    live in other towns. Although they visit sometimes, it is mostly just the two of them. Admitting Eloise so she could be with George was not a hard decision, said the couple’s doctor, U. S. Army Maj. Seth Dukes. “We take care of the people who’ve taken care of our country,” he said. “And we extend that to their loved ones. ” At this point, Dukes said, George is dealing with a combination of medical issues, and the goal is to keep him comfortable. For Eloise, it’s hard to see him unable to talk or eat much. “The expression on his face has changed; his eyes just look fixed,” she said. “It’s heartbreaking to see somebody lose everything, especially the days that he doesn’t know me. ” But her presence seems to comfort him. “He talks in his sleep, and when he starts I just put my hand on his and he stops. ” And during the day, she talks to him. “Even though I don’t know if he can hear me, I always thank him for looking after me so well. ” An aide peeked in. Eloise seemed tired. So she did what comes most naturally: She lay down beside her husband and reached for him, their hands now mottled and roped with veins, but their fingers still knowing how to intertwine. "

","  “The thing that is in Room 101 is the worst thing in the world. . . . The worst thing in the world varies from individual to individual. ”    —   George Orwell, “1984”    PHILADELPHIA  For Christos and Markela Sourovelis, for whom the worst thing was losing their home, “Room 101” was Courtroom 478 in City Hall. This “courtroom’s” name is Orwellian: There was neither judge nor jury in it. There the city government enriched itself  —   more than $64 million in a recent   span  —   by disregarding due process requirements in order to seize and sell the property of people who have not been accused, never mind convicted, of a crime.  The Sourovelises’ son, who lived at home, was arrested for selling a small amount of drugs away from home. Soon there was a knock on their door by police who said, “We’re here to take your house” and “You’re going to be living on the street” and “We do this every day. ” The Sourovelises’ doors were locked with screws, and their utilities were cut off. They had paid off the mortgage on their $350, 000 home, making it a tempting target for policing for profit.  Nationwide, proceeds from sales of seized property (homes, cars, etc.) go to the seizers. And under a federal program, state and local law enforcement can partner with federal authorities in forfeiture and reap up to 80 percent of the proceeds. This is called  —   more Orwellian newspeak  —   “equitable sharing. ” No crime had been committed in the Sourovelises’ house, but the title of the case against them was Commonwealth of Pennsylvania v. 12011 Ferndale St. Somehow, a crime had been committed by the house. In civil forfeiture, it suffices that property is suspected of having been involved in a crime. Once seized, the property’s owners bear the burden of proving their property’s innocence. “Sentence first  —   verdict afterwards,” says the queen in “Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland. ”  In Courtroom 478, the prosecutors usually assured people seeking to reclaim their property that they would not need lawyers. The prosecutors practiced   suggesting how people could regain limited control of their property: They could sell it and give half the proceeds to the city. The “hearings” in Courtroom 478 were often protracted over months, and missing even one hearing could result in instant forfeiture.  The Sourovelises were allowed to return to their house only after waiving their rights to statutory or constitutional defenses in a future forfeiture action. Such action was forestalled when their case came to the attention of the Institute for Justice (IJ)   litigators who never received the “You can’t fight city hall” memo. It disentangled the Sourovelises from the forfeiture machine, shut down Courtroom 478 and now is seeking a court ruling to tether this machine to constitutional standards.  There might somewhere be a second prominent American who endorses today’s civil forfeiture practices, but one such person is “very unhappy” with criticisms of it. At a 2015 Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on forfeiture abuses, one senator said “taking and seizing and forfeiting, through a government judicial process, illegal gains from criminal enterprises is not wrong,” and neither is law enforcement enriching itself from this. In the manner of the man for whom he soon will work, this senator asserted an unverifiable number: “95 percent” of forfeitures involve people who have “done nothing in their lives but sell dope. ” This senator said it should not be more difficult for “government to take money from a drug dealer than it is for a businessperson to defend themselves in a lawsuit. ” In seizing property suspected of involvement in a crime, government “should not have a burden of proof higher than in a normal civil case. ”  IJ’s Robert Everett Johnson notes that this senator missed a few salient points: In civil forfeiture there usually is no proper “judicial process. ” There is no way of knowing how many forfeitures involve criminals because the government takes property without even charging anyone with a crime. The government’s vast prosecutorial resources are one reason it properly bears the burden of proving criminal culpability “beyond a reasonable doubt. ” A sued businessperson does not have assets taken until he or she has lost in a trial, whereas civil forfeiture takes property without a trial and the property owner must wage a protracted, complex and expensive fight to get it returned. The Senate Judiciary Committee might want to discuss all this when considering the nominee to be the next attorney general, Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions.  Read more from George F.

142423,217888,The United States just made Middle East peace harder,Washington Post,Elliott Abrams,2016-12-23,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161224013837/https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-united-states-just-made-middle-east-peace-harder/2016/12/23/d0ecc3ea-c923-11e6-bf4b-2c064d32a4bf_story.html
","   Elliott Abrams is a senior fellow for Middle Eastern Studies at the Council on Foreign Relations and was a deputy national security adviser in the George W. Bush administration; Michael Singh is the   senior fellow and managing director at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, and was senior director for Middle East Affairs at the National Security Council from 2007 to 2008.        Sizing up the   conflict upon assuming office, President Obama decided Israeli settlements were the problem, and he insisted on a total freeze on construction. What followed were eight years of deadlock, the deterioration of U. S. relations with Israelis and Palestinians alike, and widespread disillusionment with the   solution. Despite this track record, Obama is leaving off where he began: I n a departure from Washington’s typical role as Israel’s defender at the United Nations, the United States refused to use its veto and allowed the adoption of a Security Council resolution condemning Israeli settlements. For his part,   Donald Trump had urged that the United States veto the resolution. Trump’s argument wasn’t merely that Obama should defer to his successor’s views or that the resolution was  . It was that the measure would impede rather than advance   peace  —   and he was right. First, the resolution fails to distinguish between construction in the   blocs  —   that is, settlements west of Israel’s security barrier in which about 80 percent of settlers live  —   and construction east of the barrier. Building in the major blocs is relatively uncontroversial in Israel and rarely the subject of Palestinian protests.  President George W. Bush sought to move peace talks forward in 2004 by asserting what all sides had already tacitly acknowledged  —   that there could be no return to the 1967 lines in light of the blocs’ existence, and that any negotiated border would have to reflect this reality. By refusing to confirm Bush’s position, Obama dragged the process backward and harmfully reopened old debates.  This regression is enshrined in the resolution, which “underlines that it will not recognize any changes” to the armistice lines, and demands the cessation of all settlement activities everywhere. This is unnecessary and unrealistic  —   Israelis will not bring life to a halt in towns that no one disputes they will keep  —   and is more likely to obstruct than facilitate the revival of peace talks.  Second, the resolution rewards those who argue for “internationalization” of the conflict  —   that is, for using international forums such as the U. N. European Union or International Criminal Court to impose terms on Israel, rather than resorting to negotiations. For the resolution does indeed dictate terms to Israel, not merely condemn settlement activity. It adopts, as noted above, the position that the 1967 lines, rather than today’s realities, should form the basis of talks  —   despite the fact that many Israeli communities east of those lines are decades old and that Jews have had a   presence in the West Bank for thousands of years.  It implicitly prejudges the disposition of East Jerusalem  —   one of most contentious issues dividing the parties  —   by characterizing Israeli construction as settlement activity, a stance Israelis reject. The resolution would demand an absolute halt to construction in East Jerusalem, even in the Jewish Quarter of the Old City, something no Israeli government ever would agree to do. Yet the resolution is conspicuously silent on Israeli concerns. There is no call for other states to recognize Israel’s existence  —   much less its status as a Jewish state  —   and end the conflict against it. On incitement and terrorism, it strikes a false balance by calling on “both parties” to refrain from them, despite the fact that Israel prosecutes its citizens who resort to terrorism while the Palestinian Authority lionizes them.  Ironically, though from an Israeli perspective this language may favor the Palestinians, reasonable Palestinians may suffer from it. Because the resolution, untethered as it is to any prospective diplomatic initiative or opening, will fail to yield improvements on the ground, it will further discredit the very notion of diplomacy and compromise as paths to peace and weaken those who champion them. Finally, U. S support for the resolution lends legitimacy and encouragement to the U. N.’s disproportionate and   focus on Israel. The United States has historically criticized this bias, which borders on the absurd: For example, Israel was the only country criticized by a special U. N. commission on the status of women, despite being the only state in its region where women enjoy equal rights.  Decades of such discrimination have not made Israel more accommodating to its critics, and this resolution won’t either. Instead it will reinforce Israelis’ mistrust of the U. N. thus eroding the Security Council’s capacity to contribute to the peace it professes to advance. A U. S. veto of the resolution would not have been an endorsement of settlements. Rather, it would have been an affirmation that this is an issue that can only effectively be addressed through negotiations. The best way to encourage those negotiations is not to prejudge their outcome or set timetables, but to create the right regional conditions for them by countering spoilers such as Iran and the Islamic State who oppose peaceful coexistence, as well as the right local conditions for them by reinvigorating programs aimed at building confidence through economic and security cooperation. Peace in the Middle East will not be accomplished through a U. N. vote. Rather, it will require renewed U. S. leadership in the region and the rebuilding of relationships of trust with all of our partners there. This is where the next administration should start.

","   It is one of the common questions of   theology (which is generally more insightful and useful than   theology): If God really exists, why doesn’t he show himself in some dramatic, undeniable way?  In response, author and minister Frederick Buechner proposes a thought experiment. What if God were to rearrange the stars in such a fashion that they spell out “GOD IS” in the sky, maybe to the accompaniment of soaring celestial music? For some time, Buechner speculates, the houses of worship would overflow, wars would stop and there would be “a good many tears of regret. ” And then one night, as Buechner tells it, a child with a wad of bubble gum in his cheek (speaking French in Buechner’s version) turns to his father and says: “So what if God exists? What difference does that make?” Then the message and music would fade, “or maybe they would continue for centuries to come,” says Buechner, “but it would no longer make any difference. ”  Many of us, having seen the shining words at one point or another in our lives  —   knowing in our bones that we once knew, beyond all the doubts of philosophy, that GOD IS  —   have eventually turned away with a shrug. We continue with the normal, instinctual tendencies and occupations of homo sapiens, summarized by the “Four F’s”  —   fighting, fleeing, feeding and . . . mating. We worry about finances, politics and our health, living as though our tiny lives on a small planet near an average sun in a galaxy of a hundred billion stars among 100 billion galaxies really matter to anyone. And we see only futility and cruelty in the countless lives shortened by disease or disaster, or afflicted by poverty or conflict.  We have every reason and right to question where God can be found in a world that offers no certainty written in the sky.  Where is God in the oppression of whole peoples by cruel and corrupt dictators who care nothing for the lives of the innocent? Or among more than 60 million refugees torn from their homes and forced to live as resented strangers?  Where is God in the cruel stigmas we apply to one another when it comes to AIDS, or    births or other matters of sexuality?  Where is God in the normal, often boring, occasionally squalid, preoccupations of everyday life? In the temptations and ambitions that can lead us away from our true purpose? In the anxiety and depression that stalk our days?  Where is God in the death of a friend? In being doubted by a friend? In being betrayed by a friend?  Where is God in our march toward death, either slow or fast, but always onward? When optimism becomes delusion, and hope finally fails, and we are left feeling forsaken by a silent God?  Where is God in the lowly places, in the denial of lodging to a pregnant woman, in the smell of hay and manure, in the pain of childbirth, in the smack on the bottom of an infant who begins to breathe and cry?  “Behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people. For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Savior, which is Christ the Lord. ”  By any standard, this is an odd scenario for the entrance of divinity  —   to an occupied country, of disputed parentage, forced to flee as a refugee, living and working 30 years in silence, eventually betrayed by a friend, judicially tortured and dying in utter abandonment. On a small planet, near an average star.  But this form of arrival does something important. It dusts off and reclaims every aspect of human experience and reorients our sense of low and high, weak and powerful. It is poverty given preference. It is the possibility of transcendence breaking in on any common day. It is the unexpected humility of God.  We cannot assume, of course, that this is real or true. But for countless millions who have accepted it, this story has divided B. C. and A. D. in their own lives. It has provided courage and comfort in the midst of the ordinary, the unjust and the unthinkable. It has given assurance that pain, while real, is not permanent.

142425,217890,How to defend America the Indivisible,Washington Post,Danielle Allen,2016-12-23,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161224013837/https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/how-to-defend-america-the-indivisible/2016/12/23/d7930944-c530-11e6-bf4b-2c064d32a4bf_story.html
","   Danielle Allen is a political theorist at Harvard University and a contributing columnist for The Post.       Rare indeed, and bracing, are the moments that strip us of certainties and force us back to consideration of our most fundamental values. Such was 2016. Donald Trump campaigned to an America now largely dependent on televisual and social   sources of information and misinformation. Institutions  —   such as newspapers, political parties and universities  —   that have traditionally helped test and vet evidence and argument hit, and now must face, the limits of their influence. As a society, we find that our disagreements are deep and that many of us, perhaps even most of us, too easily personalize them. We are dangerously near treating one another as aliens. Where to from here? The single most helpful resource I have hit upon this fall is an old book by the Roman politician and intellectual Cicero. It’s called “On Duties. ” In it, Cicero offers guidance on navigating turbulent political times. Remember, he says, your distinct roles and their specific responsibilities. It is fine, he says, to take on first one role, and then another, the persona of the father and then of the politician, for instance, or the persona of the philosopher and then the citizen. None of us needs to be just one thing. But as we move from role to role, we must have clearly in view the responsibilities that pertain to each. One’s duty is to perform the responsibilities of the roles one has entered into. The mission of universities is to educate. The responsibility of professors derives from that mission. The grounding commitment is to truth. The mission of a news organization is to record accurately the course of events, including patterns of deception and duplicity. Again, the grounding commitment is to truth. The mission of a citizen, an American citizen, is to defend America, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. The grounding commitment is to human moral equality, as in the Declaration of Independence. This, too, entails a dedication to truth. “We hold these truths to be ” reads the Declaration, as it introduces the fact of human moral equality. America the Indivisible spreads opportunity wide and embraces all colors, all creeds within the sunshine of equal regard. America the Indivisible looks at the divisions between rural and urban communities and seeks out   solutions. America the Indivisible looks at patterns of racial and socioeconomic residential segregation and inequalities in access to housing and transportation and seeks reinvestment in public infrastructure such as transportation and housing that will connect communities now separated. America the Indivisible defends its borders but welcomes strangers and recognizes that those who have put down roots here and put their backs into the work of building strong communities have earned our regard. And America the Indivisible rejects invidious distinctions among potential immigrants  —   quota systems must go. Entrance should be by pure lottery from among those eligible on the grounds of security assessments. America the Indivisible acknowledges the ravages of illegal drugs and seeks out solutions aimed at achieving the health and   of as many as possible touched by the world of drugs and at limiting the harm caused by drugs to the rest. America the Indivisible looks to places such as Portugal, where marijuana has been legalized and other drugs decriminalized, and adolescent drug use is down and the percentage of users seeking treatment is up. We do not look to the Philippines where a deepened investment in a “war on drugs” has metastasized into extrajudicial murder.  And America the Indivisible seeks to reduce the footprint of the   system so that we have funds to invest in public education, including our state universities. Once upon a time, we led the world in spreading the benefit of education. America the Indivisible will rediscover the truth that education is a public good. It strengthens economies, communities and individuals by spurring human flourishing. Each and every one of us can defend America the Indivisible  —   by running for office, at all levels; by seeking inclusiveness in every   process of which we are a part; by supporting organizations and leaders who defend basic political and civil rights, equal protection of the law and due process, and basic human rights, especially for the most vulnerable among us.  We can defend America the Indivisible by reminding the anchor institutions of civil society to return to their core missions and to apply themselves assiduously to their responsibilities. We can defend America the Indivisible by holding up the values we believe in, often and everywhere, with firm voices, clarity of commitment and charity toward those with whom we disagree. We can defend America the Indivisible by telling the truth.

142426,217891,Russia attacked our democracy. That demands intense review by Congress.,Washington Post,Adam Schiff,2016-12-23,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161224013837/https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/russia-attacked-our-democracy-that-demands-intense-review-by-congress/2016/12/23/291be72c-c865-11e6-8bee-54e800ef2a63_story.html
","   Adam Schiff, a Democrat, represents California in the House and serves as the ranking member on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. Jane Harman is president of the Wilson Center and a former ranking member of the committee.      Russia’s theft and strategic leaking of emails and documents from the Democratic Party and other officials present a challenge to the U. S. political system unlike anything we’ve experienced. In October, when Director of National Intelligence James R. Clapper Jr. declared that the intelligence community was confident that Russia was responsible for hacking and dumping material and that such activities could only have been authorized by Russia’s   officials, he was describing a   Watergate   but one that was carried out by a foreign adversary through cyber means.  The unprecedented interference in our election is disturbing enough, but the damage to our democratic system was compounded by campaign rhetoric calling on Russia to hack Hillary Clinton’s email. Continued dismissals of the intelligence community’s consensus view that the most senior levels of the Russian government directed the attacks undermine those in the best position to prevent and disrupt further problems.  President Obama has ordered a full review of Russia’s meddling, which will be completed before he leaves office. But that is not sufficient. Russia’s campaign was nothing short of an attack on our democracy, and without a full and bipartisan accounting of what occurred and a robust response, trust in our institutions will be diminished.  One of us currently serves as ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, while the other served in that capacity from 2003 to 2007. We share a deep appreciation for the importance of the oversight responsibilities the House and Senate intelligence committees carry out each day. Their work is done behind closed doors and away from partisanship for good reason.  Yet some issues are so significant to our national security that they require a coordinated investigation and response. A hostile foreign power meddling in our political system is one of those issues.  We believe a joint inquiry by the House and Senate intelligence committees is the best structure for a congressional investigation into Russian actions, intentions and potential responses. By virtue of their jurisdiction, the committee members have unique exposure to the murky world of intelligence and a full appreciation for Russia’s long history of interfering in the political affairs of its neighbors through covert means. A joint inquiry would be the most effective way to investigate what took place and avoid not only an unnecessary duplication of effort but also any discrepancies in the testimony to more than one investigative body. There is a clear precedent for such a structure. After the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, Congress recognized that the traditional oversight process was insufficient for an investigation of such importance and complexity, and established a joint committee on which one of us served. That committee’s recommendations were the basis for the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act, which fostered unprecedented cooperation within the intelligence community. While standing committees have substantial investigatory powers, their resources and staff are limited, and they cannot focus on a particular investigation. A joint committee has the added benefit of allowing Congress to speak with one voice.  A joint inquiry into Russian actions would demonstrate that this is not simply another oversight issue but an issue that goes to the core of our democracy. Will we tolerate the hacking of our elections by foreign powers if it is to the winner’s   benefit? If Russia is not held accountable, Moscow will continue its assault on our democratic institutions and public officials, undermining us at home and benefiting our adversaries abroad. This congressional inquiry must provide the maximum public disclosure possible. While a thorough investigation would inevitably involve highly sensitive sources and methods, such as human intelligence or signal intercepts, to be credible, an inquiry must lean toward openness even in a field comfortable with secrecy. As with the joint inquiry on intelligence and   it would entail public hearings and the issuance of a publicly available report so that the evidence collected and presented can be independently assessed. The American people need and deserve a full account of how our elections were attacked, by whom, and for what purpose.  Other members of Congress, including Reps. Elijah E. Cummings ( .) and Eric Swalwell ( .) have proposed an independent commission charged with investigating Russia’s interference, and such an idea also has merit. In the case of   the report of the joint congressional inquiry was supplemented by the independent   Commission  —   a   bipartisan panel that investigated the attacks and recommended major organizational changes to the intelligence community, many of which were implemented. An independent commission could complement a joint congressional inquiry by bringing to bear independent expertise and experience. The damage Russia’s meddling caused in this election has been done, and it is immense. We can only look forward to how we respond, and that must start with a full, bipartisan and authoritative accounting. A fragmented process among many committees cannot achieve that end, but a joint congressional inquiry can. That work must start now.

"," PRESIDENT OBAMA’S decision to abstain on a U. N. Security Council resolution condemning Israeli settlements reverses decades of practice by both Democratic and Republican presidents. The United States vetoed past resolutions on the grounds that they unreasonably singled out Jewish communities in occupied territories as an obstacle to Middle East peace, and that U. N. action was more likely to impede than advance negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians. The measure, approved 14 to 0 by the Security Council Friday, is subject to the same criticism: It will encourage Palestinians to pursue more international sanctions against Israel rather than seriously consider the concessions necessary for statehood, and it will give a boost to the international boycott and divestment movement against the Jewish state, which has become a rallying cause for  . At the same time, it will almost certainly not stop Israeli construction in the West Bank, much less in East Jerusalem, where Jewish housing was also deemed by the resolution to be “a flagrant violation under international law. ”  By abstaining, the administration did not explicitly support that position, which has not been U. S. policy since the Carter administration. In explaining the vote, U. S. Ambassador Samantha Power pointed out that the council was sanctioning Israel even while failing to take action to stop a potential genocide in South Sudan or the slaughter in Aleppo, Syria. Yet in failing to veto the measure, the Obama administration set itself apart both from previous administrations and from the incoming presidency of Donald Trump, who spoke out strongly against the resolution. A   White House may feel a radical change in policy is justified by Israel’s shift to the right under Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu; Israel’s governing coalition is supporting legislation that would legalize dozens of settlements that Israel itself defines as illegal, because they were constructed on private Palestinian property. Mr. Netanyahu supported a partial settlement freeze for 10 months in 2009 and 2010 at Mr. Obama’s behest, but has since allowed construction, including in some areas deep in the West Bank. Nevertheless, settlements do not explain the administration’s repeated failures to broker an   peace. The Palestinian Authority under Mahmoud Abbas proved unwilling to negotiate seriously even during the settlement freeze, and it refused to accept a framework for negotiations painstakingly drawn up by Secretary of State John F. Kerry in 2014. In past negotiations, both sides have acknowledged that any deal will involve the annexation by Israel of settlements near its borders, where most of the current construction takes place  —   something the U. N. resolution, which was pressed by the Palestinians, did not acknowledge or take into account.      (Reuters)   Israeli officials charged that the abstention represented a vindictive parting shot by Mr. Obama at Mr. Netanyahu, with whom he has feuded more bitterly than he did with most U. S. adversaries. The vote could also be seen as an attempt to preempt Mr. Trump, who appears ready to shift U. S. policy to the opposite extreme after naming a militant advocate of the settlements as his ambassador to Israel. Whatever the motivation, Mr. Obama’s gesture is likely to do more harm than good.

142428,217893,The ‘app of choice’ for jihadists: ISIS seizes on Internet tool to promote terror,Washington Post,Joby Warrick,2016-12-23,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161224013837/https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/the-app-of-choice-for-jihadists-isis-seizes-on-internet-tool-to-promote-terror/2016/12/23/a8c348c0-c861-11e6-85b5-76616a33048d_story.html
","         When the Islamic State was seeking volunteers for a holiday killing rampage in Europe, it sent word over its favorite   channel: the messaging service known as Telegram. “Christmas, Hanukkah, and New Years Day is very soon,” began a Dec. 6 posting on one of the terrorist group’s usual Telegram bulletin boards. “So let’s prepare a gift for the filthy  . ” Two weeks later, when a truck mowed down pedestrians at a crowded Berlin Christmas market, the group again used Telegram, this time to claim credit for the attack. On Friday, after chief suspect Anis Amri was killed in a Milan shootout, Telegram broadcast his posthumous video. The Tunisian migrant had fled Berlin and crisscrossed France and Italy before being stopped by Italian police looking for a burglary suspect. In his video he pledges allegiance to the Islamic State and issues a chilling warning to Westerners: “God willing, we will slaughter you. ” The words and images flew across the globe over a network that terrorist leaders describe as ideal for their purposes  —   one that is highly discreet, with its heavy encryption and secret chat rooms, but also highly permissive, allowing violent Islamist groups to exchange ideas and spread propaganda with minimal interference. The same conclusion has been reached by terrorism analysts who say Telegram is now overwhelmingly preferred by extremist groups such as the Islamic State, in part because the company has failed to adopt the aggressive measures used by its competitors to kick terrorists off its channels.  A report this week by an organization that monitors Islamist militants’ Internet communications calls Telegram “the app of choice for many ISIS,   and other jihadi and terrorist elements. ” The study describes the terrorists’ mass migration to Telegram as one of the most striking developments in the field recently. ISIS is one of the common acronyms for the Islamic State. “It has surpassed Twitter as the most important platform,” said Steven Stalinsky, lead author of the report by the   Middle East Media Research Institute, also known as MEMRI. “All the big groups are on it. We see ISIS talking about the benefits of Telegram and encouraging its followers to use it. ”    Mansour   top, and Anat Agron, part of MEMRI’s Jihad and Terrorism Threat Monitor project, monitor the   site Telegram on Dec. 22 in their office in Washington. (Bill O’  Washington Post)   Terrorists’ use of Telegram has been a growing concern among U. S. and European counterterrorism officials for more than a year, as well as a source of numerous inquiries and complaints lodged against the   company and its creator, Pavel Durov, a    Russian national who launched the service in 2013 with his brother Nikolai. Just three days before the assault on the Berlin Christmas market, senior members of the House Foreign Affairs Committee urged Durov to immediately take steps to block content from the Islamic State, warning that terrorists were using the platform not only to spread propaganda but also to coordinate actual attacks. “No private company should allow its services to be used to promote terrorism and plan out attacks that spill innocent blood,” stated the letter, signed by Rep. Ted Poe ( .) the chairman of the panel’s subcommittee on terrorism and nonproliferation, and Rep. Brad Sherman (Calif.) the ranking Democrat on the subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific. Efforts this week to reach Telegram’s founder through his   accounts were unsuccessful. Durov, who fled Russia in 2014 and now lives in a kind of   exile as a citizen of the island state of Saint Kitts and Nevis, has in past interviews and essays defended his company’s efforts at   noting that Telegram shut down 78 channels used by the Islamic State in the wake of the Nov. 13, 2015, terrorist attack in Paris. In March, Durov told CBS’s “60 Minutes” that he was “horrified” to see terrorist groups infesting Telegram’s chat rooms, and he said the company was trying to do more to stop them. But Durov also contends that it is impossible to fully prevent terrorists from taking advantage of the encrypted communication services Telegram offers to its 100 million active users, a global network that includes millions of people living in countries that deny citizens the right to free expression. “There’s little you can do, because if you allow this tool to be used for good, there will always be some people who would misuse it,” Durov told CBS.  But critics of the company  —   a cohort that includes   U. S. counterterrorism officials  —   say Telegram could do more. A primary reason for the German firm’s popularity with violent groups is the fact that rival   companies have aggressively cracked down on them, U. S. officials say. Facebook and Twitter  —   two firms that were once criticized for allowing terrorist postings on their pages  —   have received high marks in recent months for their efforts to find and block radical Islamist content as soon as the material surfaces.     These images on the left and right show a conversation among Islamic State supporters on the   app Telegram discussing a possible plot to attack U. S. and British targets. (Middle East Media Research Institute)     Terrorism analysts say Telegram is now overwhelmingly preferred by extremist groups such the Islamic State. (Middle East Media Research Institute)    “Positive steps by Twitter, for example, are part of the reason Telegram is becoming the new thing,” said a senior administration official involved in tracking the Islamic State’s online presence. The official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive analysis of the terrorist group’s operations, called the migration to Telegram a “major cause of concern,” in part because of encryption features that make it harder for law enforcement officials to discover and thwart the terrorists’ plans. “It’s alarming because it shows they’re really good at adapting to new means,” the official said. To stop attacks, private companies and government officials must stay a step ahead of the terrorists and “figure out how to deny them these capabilities before they even start using them,” he said, adding, “That simply hasn’t been the case with Telegram. ” New    features installed by Telegram have made the task of preempting terrorism even harder, government officials and private experts say. Originally a   software with a relatively small but devoted following, Telegram last year introduced a new version for desktop computers that made it easier to transmit videos and large files as well as private messages. New “end to end” encryption was added in April to give users an extra assurance of privacy. Independent analysts have described the quality of Telegram’s encryption as “military grade,” meaning that it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to crack. Users can also opt for a   feature in which private messages disappear as soon as they are read. MEMRI’s Stalinsky monitors hundreds of   Telegram channels from a bank of computers at his office, watching live “chats” joined by individuals who sign on to forums linked to the Islamic State,   and dozens of other groups. Often, he says, a participant in one of the open discussions will signal that he wants to have a private conversation. That typically means joining a temporary,   “secret” chat group that will exist for only a few hours and then disappear. “If you’re not watching at that precise moment, you’d never know about it,” Stalinsky said.  Even the more public conversations often convey specific instructions about bombmaking or potential targets for terrorist attacks. In recent months, Islamic State leaders and supporters have posted messages on Telegram containing lengthy “kill lists” of Westerners the terrorists sought to mark for execution, as well as appeals to sympathetic scientists and engineers to join the Islamic State’s efforts to produce advanced weapons. Last month, Stalinsky, using an anonymous user name, gained entrance to a secret Telegram chat in which   British and American supporters of the Islamic State discussed ideas for attacking the U. S. Embassy in London. Stalinsky alerted U. S. officials to the conversation, and there is no known evidence suggesting that the   terrorists put their plan into motion. But images of the text exchange show the participants discussing in detail the logistics for such an attack, including weapons and travel arrangements. The individuals even discuss whether they should take steps to avoid killing women and children. “Women and children should be off limits,” one of the participants wrote. “We do not want to be like kuffar [infidels]. ” The fact that the group allowed a complete stranger to monitor the chat suggests that the plotters were not true Islamic State operatives. While Telegram’s users include senior terrorist leaders and operatives, many   inhabitants appear to be merely fanboys and wannabes, and some clearly “are not that smart,” Stalinsky said. Yet, even bumblers are capable of striking a blow for the Islamic State. And using Telegram, Stalinsky said, the naive and willing have opportunities to connect with professionals  —   experts at the tools of terrorism and the use of social media  —   to put deadly plans into action. “The West has been generally two steps behind the jihadis when it comes to cyber,” Stalinsky said. “Many people in government are still focused on Twitter, and they need to be. But what we tell them is, ‘That’s no longer the main story.’ ”     "

","  DETROIT  —   Keith Ellison, the Minnesota congressman who could become the first Muslim chairman of an American political party, spent Thursday night behind a pulpit. Ellison’s brother Brian, a Baptist reverend, provided the Church of the New Covenant as a venue for a town hall spotlighting the lawmaker’s bid to run the Democratic National Committee. The sermon: how to move past the disastrous 2016 election and battle Donald Trump. “If you had a beef on Twitter with somebody, make peace, because you were probably arguing with a Russian or a bot,” said Ellison. “We need new energy coming into this party, and we need people with institutional memory. We need people who are really psyched up, and we need people who know where the bodies are buried. Do we, in the era of Trump, have somebody to waste?” He looked around the room, with around 150 nervous Democrats spilling from the pews into the hallway. “Not nobody!” stated Ellison. Just 437 people will elect the next chair of the Democratic National Committee, which is trying to rebuild after Hillary Clinton’s devastating loss to Trump and President Obama’s release of his grip on the party after eight years.   DNC chair candidate Rep. Keith Ellison, right, hugs his brother, Baptist pastor Brian Ellison, at the Church of the New Covenant before speaking in Detroit on Dec. 22, 2016. (Nick   The Washington Post)  But in what could prove a problem for Ellison  —   who is running as the candidate of Sen. Bernie Sanders’s ( .) “revolution”  —   435 of them were not in the room on Thursday night. With eight weeks to go until the Feb.   election, Ellison is taking an   approach with rallies and shows of public support meant to demonstrate that he could turn the DNC into a revolutionary organization. The Minnesota Democrat remains the central figure in the contest  —   though not obviously the  . Unlike the divisive   primary contest  —   when progressives battled the   Clintons  —   there are not the same cleavages in the DNC battle. None of Ellison’s four rivals has challenged the   rewrite of the Democratic Party platform, which Ellison was part of. Ellison and Ray Buckley, the chairman of New Hampshire’s Democrats, have published the most about their ideas. They generally agree on ideas such as upping funds for state parties, boosting turnout (Ellison’s goal is a boost of 3 to 7 percent) and guarding against voter suppression. Democrats instead are engaging in a   argument about the 2016 primaries, the Clinton campaign and Obama’s legacy. Tom Perez, the outgoing labor secretary who entered the DNC race last week, has institutional support at exactly the time Democratic activists have stopped trusting their institutions. Buckley has told audiences that his state ignored the Clinton campaign to do its own voter persuasion  —   and win. When they drill down, all three candidates, as well as South Carolina’s Jaime Harrison and Idaho’s Sally Boynton Brown, came to the same conclusions about 2016: The national Democratic Party focused on swing states and let state parties wither behind the “blue wall”  —   which promptly cracked. Democratic voters in rural areas, rarely contacted by the Clinton campaign or by state parties, switched to Trump. “We need to commit ourselves, once a week, to go to a new neighborhood and talk to everybody,” Ellison said Thursday night in Detroit.   DNC chair candidate Keith Ellison, center, talks with college friend Terry Price, right, and Gary Jones, left, while at 1917 American Bistro in Detroit on Dec. 22, 2016. (Nick   The Washington Post)  “You don’t win elections with an    organizer,” Perez told the Huffington Post this week. “It’s a   investment. ” In 2004, the last year the DNC rebuilt after an election loss, there was a real argument about whether to focus on   state party building or on fundraising. That argument doesn’t exist after 2016 losses at every level of government. In every swing state, and in former strongholds, Democrats have lost ground in local races since 2008. In 2018, they face a     chance to elect governors who can stop the next round of gerrymandering, after a devastating 2011 map drawn by Republicans. The subtext, lost on no DNC member, is that Republicans conquered key territory on Obama’s watch, hurting any Obama ally’s ability to lead a recovery. Several Democrats who support Ellison pointed to the long tenure of former DNC Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz, who presided over loss after loss with no real effort by the Obama political operation to intervene. “The DNC has been worthless,” said retiring Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid ( .) this week, in an interview with a radio station in Nevada. In an interview Thursday, Ellison complimented the Obama campaign for its “Fight the Smears” project, which he credited with bypassing the press to defeat nasty rumors. That was the extent of his praise. Ellison, too, had been countering attacks on his personal life, from his youthful praise of Louis Farrakhan to money problems revealed in his 2006House race. These were the sort of distractions that a forceful party could confront, he said  —   live streams and social media could get strong Democrats past the “smears” in the press. In his Huffington Post interview, asked whether Obama “undermined” the DNC by creating an outside political effort in Organizing for America, Perez pivoted to talk about the economic crisis he inherited and argued that Obama “won two elections and was able to win a historic election in 2008. ” In a   question from The Washington Post, Perez said through a spokeswoman the president had a role to play in rebuilding the party. “I welcome his support to build an organization that reflects the big tent of the party and his input on how to develop a message of inclusion and opportunity that is at the core of who we are as Democrats,” said Perez. “No one does that better than President Obama, and we will need his support. ” But to some Democrats, who are leaving the Obama years weaker than they entered them, defending the party’s outgoing management means it will never get past the lessons of 2016. That was exposed in Michigan just a few weeks before Ellison arrived. When the Michigan Democratic Party gathered to select new DNC delegates, supporters of Sanders showed up in campaign gear, and in force. When they tried to enter an   meeting of labor organizers, a camera caught one organizer shoving Sam Pernick, the   chair of the Young Democrats of Michigan. It ended in a criminal complaint and several     news stories about a party in disarray. “We came there to protest a lack of transparency and support Keith Ellison for DNC chair,” Pernick said in a statement. “The reaction from leaders within the party was to violently throw us out of the room. ” Perez, who endorsed Clinton, is viewed warmly by progressives because of his record inside the Labor and Justice departments. Despite that, he’s been viewed warily by Sanders’s supporters, who see him as a vehicle for the party’s status quo. After his first public speech as a candidate, in Texas, a citizen journalist taped Perez’s gauzy answer to a question about the   Partnership, the moldering trade deal he’d supported from inside the Obama administration. Within hours, the   Twitter account People for Bernie was promoting the video. Buckley said there are plenty of sore feelings in Michigan from the primaries, which some Sanders’s supporters viewed as rigged by a   DNC. “I think that if you add up Jill Stein and Bernie   votes, you get to 10, 000 in Michigan,” said Buckley. “If only 20 percent of the protest voters were people who couldn’t get over the nominating process, then it mattered. And it’s not just the neutrality issue  —   it’s joint fundraising, caucuses and superdelegates. There were a number of issues that were out there that caused great strife. “I don’t think we ever properly addressed them. ” Ellison, who was urged to run by Sanders, has no problem winning the loyalty of those voters. But only a few of them hold the positions  —   DNC member or state party chair  —   that will select the next DNC leader. Brandon Dillon, the chair of Michigan’s party, attended Thursday’s town hall and complimented the crowd  —   but said he was still working through his own support and had yet to talk to Perez. “There’s a certain number of people who may only get reengaged if Keith is chair, but a larger group who want to be active no matter what happens,” he said. On Thursday, Ellison framed himself as a unity candidate who could get Clinton’s and Sanders’s supporters past the primaries  —   while adopting what had worked for Sanders. In a pamphlet distributed at his rallies, Ellison promised to change the DNC’s fundraising model so that “  contributions from everyday Americans account for 33 percent of revenue. ” Ellison raised that standard in The Post interview, saying that a majority of the DNC’s money should probably come from small donations and the party needed to be ready to reject checks from “foreclosure kings” or other malevolent interests. A lot of people said, “ ‘No one owns Bernie because he’s funded by the people. No one owns Trump because he funds his own campaign,’ ” Ellison said. “I’m telling you that the Democratic Party must be perceived as funded by the people. ” At his brother’s church, Ellison preached the same point: No matter whom Democrats supported in the 2016 primaries, no matter if a voter had bailed on the party to back Trump, Democrats need to turn away from the   spigot. Without mentioning Clinton, he described the damage done when Democrats were perceived to be bending policy to curry donations from big banks and corporate interests. “Once your grass roots is funding the party,” he said, “the lines of accountability run the right way. ” "

The incident was first reported by TMZ  —   which described Fisher as having a “massive heart attack”  —   and confirmed by multiple outlets, including NBC News and the Los Angeles Times. Representatives for Fisher did not immediately return The Post’s inquires. At 12:11 p. m. Pacific time, the Los Angeles Fire Department responded to Gate 74 at Los Angeles International Airport “for a patient on an inbound flight in cardiac arrest,” department spokesman Erik Scott said. “Paramedics were standing by for the plane’s arrival, provided advanced life support and aggressively treated and transported the patient to a local hospital. ” Scott declined to provide any additional information about the patient, including name, age or gender. Medical personnel met the United flight 935 from London to Los Angeles “upon arrival today after the crew reported that a passenger was unresponsive,” United Airlines said in a statement that also did not name Fisher. “Our thoughts are with our customer at this time. ” Fisher had been aboard a flight from London to Los Angeles when she suffered a “cardiac episode” that left her in critical condition, emergency officials told the L.

A number of people tweeted that they had been on the United flight with Fisher, including one who wrote that Fisher was taken off the plane by EMTs. The actress rose to stardom as Princess Leia in the Star Wars franchise and has recently been on tour to promote her new memoir, “The Princess Diarist. ” Fisher’s “Star Wars”   Mark Hamill tweeted, “as if 2016 couldn’t get any worse . . . sending all our love” to Fisher.

","     Carl Paladino, a former Republican nominee for governor of New York and an adviser to   Trump, included the death of President Obama and “return” of first lady Michelle Obama to Africa on his list of things he wanted for 2017. Paladino was responding to a survey by an alternative weekly magazine, Artvoice. Asked what he would like to happen in 2017, he said he hopes that “Obama catches mad cow disease” and dies after having relations with a Hereford, a type of cow. Asked what he would most like to see go, Paladino responded that Michelle Obama would “return to being male” and be “let loose” in Zimbabwe. Full exchange: Artvoice: What would you most like to happen in 2017? Carl Paladino: Obama catches mad cow disease after being caught having relations with a Herford. He dies before his trial and is buried in a cow pasture next to Valerie Jarret, who died weeks prior, after being convicted of sedition and treason, when a Jihady cell mate mistook her for being a nice person and decapitated her. Artvoice: What would you most like to see go in 2017? Carl Paladino: Michelle Obama. I’d like her to return to being a male and let loose in the outback of Zimbabwe where she lives comfortably in a cave with Maxie, the gorilla. In a statement to The Post, Paladino denied that the comments were racist. “It has nothing to do with race,” Paladino said. “That’s the typical stance of the press when they can’t otherwise defend the acts of the person being attacked. ” “It’s about 2 progressive elitist ingrates who have hated their country so badly and destroyed its fabric in so many respects in 8 years,” he added. Reached briefly by phone Friday, Paladino confirmed that he made the comments and that he is currently involved in Trump’s transition efforts. “I don’t think Mr. Trump particularly cares what I have to say,” Paladino said. “He knows me. I was active with him, and I still am active with him. ” “And that’s it. I’ll say what I feel like saying. ” No stranger to controversy, Paladino has repeatedly over the years attacked Obama privately and publicly  —   including pushing the falsehood that Obama is Muslim. During his gubernatorial race, Paladino was accused of sending graphically racist and sexist emails  —   some of them concerning Obama  —   to his circle of friends. Paladino never denied sending the emails but called them a “smear. ” As recently as Dec. 5, Paladino visited Trump Tower after the election. “We’re friends,” Paladino told reporters afterward. “My meeting was good. ” And this week, Paladino, a Buffalo school board member, sought to have photos of Trump hung in all of the city’s schools. A Trump spokeswoman condemned Paladino’s comments but did not comment on the future of his work for the transition. ”Carl’s comments are absolutely reprehensible, and they serve no place in our public discourse,” said spokeswomen Jessica Ditto. Others have been quick to denounce Paladino, a political figure who has come to be known for the cloud of controversy that often surrounds him. In a statement, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat,  slammed Paladino for a ”long history of racist and incendiary comments.” ”Carl Paladino, a Republican Party official from Western New York, made racist, ugly and reprehensible remarks about President Obama and the First Lady Michelle Obama,” Cuomo said. ”While most New Yorkers know Mr. Paladino is not to be taken seriously, as his erratic behavior defies any rational analysis and he has no credibility, his words are still jarring. ”His remarks do not reflect the sentiments or opinions of any real New Yorker and he has embarrassed the good people of the state with his latest   rage,” he added.      The gold elevators in Trump Tower have been the center of attention since Donald Trump won the presidential election Nov. 8. Here’s a look back at some of the most interesting people who’ve met with Trump to date. (Deirdra O’  Washington Post)   In a statement Paladino’s alma mater St. Bonaventure University, where he once served on the board of trustees, denounced his comments. ”Mr. Paladino’s remarks in ArtVoice are reprehensible and in complete contradiction to the values of St. Bonaventure University,” said Andrew Roth, the University’s president. ”At St. Bonaventure we believe in an inclusive community that values diversity as a strength. ”While as educators we know we never attain 100% it is reasonably certain that the vast majority of St. Bonaventure’s extended family  —   students, Franciscans, faculty, staff and alumni  —   share in the rejection of Mr. Paladino’s comments and the comments of any who violate our shared values of individual dignity, community inclusiveness and service to others,” he added.

","     MIAMI  —   There tend to be two seasons in South Florida: hot and wet from May to October, then warm and dry from November to April. But the past two Decembers have made the   phrase “endless summer” a reality  —   great for our visitors, not so great for us. Floridians  —   especially in the southern half of the state  —   look forward to ideal winter weather after enduring relentless   conditions for six months. Winters are still warm, but things dry out and the oppressive heat takes a leave of absence. However, much to our dismay, the region is experiencing one of its warmest Decembers on record.   Average temperature rankings across Florida so far this month. A 1 indicates the warmest on record, 2 is second warmest, etc. (Southeast Regional Climate Center)  In 2015 and again in 2016, Miami’s weather in December was essentially no different from that in June or July  —   high temperatures in the upper 80s, dew points in the upper 70s. The resulting heat index was then in the 90s. In Miami, over a dozen records have already been broken this month. All of them have been   records; there hasn’t been a single cold record in winter’s first month. To track record warmth, there are actually three daily values that are worth monitoring: the high temperature, the low temperature and the average temperature.    A timeline of   records during December for Miami. The year when each daily record was set is shown above each marker, with 2016 highlighted in red. (B. McNoldy)  Of the 93 possible records shown in this chart, 33 of them (35 percent) were set just in 2015 and 2016, and 54 of them (58 percent) were set in the past 10 years. That’s worth repeating: 35 percent of all of our December   records have been set in the past two years, and 58 percent have happened since 2006. That is a stunning statistic, but it shouldn’t come as a surprise in a warming world. Across the country, heat records have far outpaced cold records. By the end of the century, scientists expect that, on average, 15 heat records will be set for every one cold record. Unfortunately for Floridians yearning for more seasonable weather, the outlook is not promising. The record warmest average temperature and warmest low temperature for the entire month of December were just broken this past Sunday, and it doesn’t look like this pattern will budge. NOAA’s Climate Prediction Center says Florida has a very high likelihood of staying warmer than normal through the end of the month. In fact, all of the center’s outlooks indicate that south Florida can expect   temperatures for quite some time  —   possibly even through March  —   breaking more records along the way.

142433,217898,Jaguars and Rams coaching jobs aren’t as unattractive as you might think,Washington Post,Mark Maske,2016-12-23,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161224013837/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/sports/wp/2016/12/23/jaguars-and-rams-coaching-jobs-arent-as-unattractive-as-you-might-think/
","     The head coaching vacancies of the Jacksonville Jaguars and Los Angeles Rams are not, at first glance, particularly glamorous by NFL standards. The Jaguars have a record of   as they complete their ninth straight   season. Their   franchise quarterback, Blake Bortles, seems to have regressed this season. The franchise’s management drew some criticism for how it handled the firing of Gus Bradley as coach, informing him of the move following Sunday’s    defeat at Houston and then making him accompany the team on its flight home. The Rams are   one game  —   and one loss  —   into the tenure of their interim coach, John Fassel, after firing Jeff Fisher. Their losing ways followed them from St. Louis to L. A. and they haven’t reached the playoffs since the 2004 season or posted a winning record since the 2003 season. The quarterback they selected first overall in the NFL draft last spring, Jared Goff, needed more than half the season to become the starter and hasn’t dazzled anyone since taking over.  But the reality is teams that fire coaches rarely can present anything resembling perfect situations to potential successors. And, as these things go, the Jacksonville and L. A. coaching jobs actually have some things working in their favor, people within the league say. “Those are not terrible jobs,” a front office executive with one NFL team said. “Neither one of them. ” In the Jaguars’ case, there clearly is talent on the roster. Expectations for this season were raised after Bortles showed improvement last year. There were play makers around him on offense, the thinking went, with an infusion of young talent on defense. The Jaguars used the fifth overall choice in this year’s NFL draft on cornerback Jalen Ramsey. They were able to get linebacker Myles Jack, regarded by many as a   talent but plagued by concerns over knee issues, in the second round. They had pass rusher Dante Fowler Jr. the third overall pick in the 2015 draft, returning from the knee injury that cost him his entire rookie season. Little went as planned. Ramsey appears to be the real deal, but Fowler has made only one start and has just 2. 5 sacks this season. Jack, who has made eight starts, has been credited with a modest 24 tackles. Most alarming of all, Bortles’s play in his third NFL season has raised questions as to whether he is a franchise    . He has thrown 16 interceptions and his passer rating has dipped to 75. 8.  So the tasks for the next coach will include both making a decision about Bortles and getting more out of the celebrated youngsters on defense. On the positive side, the bar has been lowered considerably after Bradley went   in his nearly four seasons. Jaguars owner Shahid Khan has a reputation within the league for being relatively patient and reasonable, and the smaller Jacksonville market is not quite as oppressively demanding as is the case in some other NFL cities. “I still think the quarterback can be fixed with some work,” the front office executive said. “I don’t think you’re starting over. I still think there are some pieces in place. The right guy might turn that around faster than you think. ” The spotlight is considerably brighter and more intense in L. A. of course. The excitement of the Rams being back in town wore off quickly this season as the losses piled up while Fisher and the team made missteps such as engaging in a public squabble with Pro Football Hall of Famer Eric Dickerson.  Goff has made five starts and has an ugly passer rating of 65. 7.   tailback Todd Gurley is averaging 3. 2 yards per carry, down from 4. 8 as a rookie. However, the front office executive said, “You put a better offensive line in place there, and you might find out that you’re pretty well set. ” A personnel executive with another team said he likes the talent on the Rams’ defense and believes that the L. A. market eventually can be used as a drawing card for free agents. “That’s a place where you really should be able to get it done,” that front office staffer said. “You should be able to get a   coach to go there. ”"

","     Today is the last cutoff for the U. S. Postal Service’s holiday shipping. But if you’re still stumped about someone’s gift (or if their name slipped your mind and your list) all is not lost. One of the best things about the Internet is that it transcends the physical  —   though not the commercial  —   bonds of the holiday season. But just because a gift is electronic, or   doesn’t always make it less thoughtful. There are plenty of ways to buy good gifts that will deliver instantly. Plus, you get to save on gift wrap. Here are some suggestions: Subscription boxes  —   You could rush to send one present now, or take a deep breath and send three, six or 12 throughout the year. Subscription boxes, which give their recipients mystery packages based on a theme, can now be found for almost any interest. Whether you’re looking for a gift for someone who wants to spice up their wardrobe or spice up their diet, there’s a box out to fit their tastes. Try browsing through Cratejoy or Quarterly for suggestions for a variety of boxes, or maybe just run an online search for “[your interest here] subscription box” and see what turns up. Experiences  —   Buying experiences  —   a   balloon ride, a semester of art classes, a night at the theater, a    —   has a couple of advantages. For one, they have to be thoughtful, so even if you only thought of someone at the last minute, it really won’t seem like a rush job. Two, an experience is not a gift you can really wrap anyway, so there’s no shame in sending it electronically. You can scour sites such as Groupon for prepackaged ideas or just run a search for your recipient’s interests in their hometown and see where it takes you. Or fashion one of your own by looking for local businesses such as vineyards, community classes, art stores, spas, cooking stores, athletic groups and food tours with websites that will let you book these types of experiences for someone else. Picking multiple activities can be a nice way to keep the present going throughout the year.    —   Books are always popular gifts for the holidays, so why not try their electronic versions? It may not have the heft of a   book, but it does have advantages.   prices tend to be a little cheaper than hardcovers, so you can buy a whole shelf’s worth of books for the reader in your life. Not to mention, it saves a lot of room for travelers who probably aren’t looking to pack a library. You can give   in a lot of ways. Amazon’s Kindle lets you send   from a book’s product page. (Amazon chief executive Jeffrey P. Bezos is the owner of The Washington Post.) You can also give titles via iBooks by hitting the “gift” option in the share menu from the iBooks app. Or you can go through Google Play with a general gift card to Google’s app store. If books aren’t quite right, you could consider giving a subscription to a magazine or newspaper, or try an audiobook subscription from a company such as Amazon’s Audible. Streaming video subscriptions  —   Everyone likes to veg out now and then. And the gift of a streaming video service, such as Hulu or Netflix, gives your loved ones a license to chill. The giving process for some of these subscriptions has become a little more complicated of late, as neither Netflix nor Hulu offers gift codes from their own sites anymore. However, many retailers  —   including Walmart, Amazon and Newegg  —   will let you purchase subscription gift cards and deliver them electronically. If you’re looking for something a little more specialized, check for niche streaming services that serve your needs. Acorn TV, for example, could be good for the Anglophile in your life. Or try Crunchyroll for anime fans. Horror fans may want to sink their teeth into Shudder, AMC’s   streaming site. There’s even a streaming site just for Broadway shows. Or, if your intended gift recipient can’t get enough of a particular channel  —   HBO, Showtime, etc.  —   see if there is a streaming service just for that channel’s shows. Streaming music subscriptions  —   Music service subscriptions are another good option for a digital gift, particularly if you never quite understood your Uncle Harold’s music taste to begin with. Buy a new subscription or, if your intended recipient already uses a music service  —   such as Pandora, Spotify, iTunes, etc.  —   you can buy a premium subscription. In the case of Apple Music or Google Play Music (which will also get them access to YouTube’s premium service, YouTube Red) you can buy a gift card through the appropriate app store. Donations  —   Some giftees may prefer material presents. But for those who really do seem to have everything or those who wear their hearts on their sleeves, matching the right recipient to the right charity can be gifting gold. That may be especially relevant during a political year, when big issues beg our attention. Most charities will take online donations and often make it very easy to give in someone else’s name. Be sure to include a thoughtful note explaining why you wanted to contribute in the name of the person on your list. Games  —   If you have a gamer in your life, it’s pretty easy to give the joy of video games online  —   which is how more than 50 percent of sales are going. You can buy gift cards for the PlayStation, Xbox and Nintendo online stores by heading to their websites. If the person on your list is more of a PC fan, there’s always the Steam platform, or you can buy cards for individual publishers (like Electronic Arts) or individual games, such as League of Legends, through retailers. All in all, digital gifts can be just as touching and lovely as any beautifully wrapped present. Though, if you’re still feeling guilty, you can always include a homemade cookie or other tasty treat to go along with your gift."

","         The crimes were so horrific that even a longtime prosecutor choked on his words when he recalled what happened to the two victims. On the evening of Dec. 5, 2015, two    male students from the University of Rochester were lured to a house several miles from campus, believing they were headed to a party. One of the men and a female acquaintance had been flirting on Facebook, and the young woman invited them to come hang out. Instead, the students walked into a trap. Moments after they arrived, the house went dark and a group of masked men pounced on them, bound them in duct tape and hauled them into a bathroom. There, over the next 40 hours, the attackers repeatedly tortured and sexually abused them, cutting them with knives and a chainsaw, dousing them in flammable liquids, and even shooting one in his legs. (The Post does not name victims of sexual abuse.) A police SWAT team stormed the house the following day and rescued the students, and eventually nine people were arrested and charged. Matthew Schwartz, one of the lead prosecutors in the case, would later say it was incredible that the students survived.   Strickland gets 155 to life in UR  ; 3 others sentenced https:  .  via @DandC  —   D&C Digital (@DandC) December 21, 2016   “Something particularly horrible like this,” Schwartz told the Chicago Tribune, “sometimes it’s worse than homicide. The torture that went on is almost indescribable. ” On Wednesday, four people convicted in connection with the attack were sentenced in New York Supreme Court, among them the man who orchestrated the students’ abduction and torture. Lydell Strickland, 27, was sentenced to 155 years to life in prison after being found guilty of more than two dozen charges, including kidnapping, assault, gang assault and sexual abuse, according to the Democrat and Chronicle. In court Wednesday, Strickland was defiant, smiling as Justice Alex Renzi told him his crimes sounded like the script of a Quentin Tarantino movie, the Democrat and Chronicle reported. “I was trying to think if there were any redeeming qualities that you had,” Renzi told him, “and I couldn’t come up with any. ” “How can someone do this to another human being?” he added. Three of Strickland’s   were also sentenced for their roles in the case. David   convicted of kidnapping and weapons charges, received a   prison sentence, which he will serve after he completes a   sentence for an unrelated crime, the Democrat and Chronicle reported. Inalia Rolldan and Ruth Lora were sentenced to seven years each following their convictions on kidnapping and weapons charges. They were at the house when the students were taken captive, but they did not participate in the torture, according to the Democrat and Chronicle. An attorney for   25, said his client did not assault the victims. “I don’t think there was anybody who disagreed with the fact that my client didn’t hit anybody, didn’t torture anybody, didn’t go into any of the rooms where the individuals were being held,” Frank Ciardi told TWC News.

Strickland’s attorney told TWC news he planned to appeal the sentence but did not elaborate. A defense attorney for Lora could not immediately be reached for comment but said during her trial last month that she had no role in the case other than a romantic interest in another suspect. Five other defendants have pleaded guilty to various roles in the attack. In November, four of them received sentences ranging from 13 to 35 years in prison, the Democrat and Chronicle reported. How the two students became the targets of such a brutal crime remained a mystery until last fall when court documents and testimony revealed the details of their ambush and torture. Strickland and his   mistakenly believed the students, who played on the university’s football team, were involved in the robbery of a group of drug dealers in November 2015, prosecutors told the Tribune. Seeking retribution, the defendants convinced a woman to flirt with one of them on Facebook. The woman eventually invited him to a party in northeast Rochester, and he asked if he could bring the other, a friend. “The second victim being involved was pure happenstance,” Schwartz told the Tribune. On Dec. 5, 2015, two women picked up the students and drove them to the house, where Strickland and others were waiting in masks and dark clothing. They surrounded the students, and one of them was shot in the leg with a .  rifle as he tried to escape, shattering his femur, prosecutors said. After binding the students with duct tape, the group subjected them to a range of tortures over the course of nearly two days. One of the students described the ordeal from the witness stand in November. He and his friend were beaten with pipes and bats, threatened with guns, and even cut with a chainsaw, he said, and recounted how the attackers sliced the skin between his toes with a knife and pliers, according to TWC News. At one point he was shot in his other leg and later had to undergo surgery. He told the court the defendants doused them in flammable liquid and threatened to light them on fire. He said the defendants also stole thousands of dollars from his bank accounts after forcing him to give up his passwords and identification numbers. “The torture consists of something you would see in a movie, but it’s not a movie because this is real life,” he said, according to the Democrat and Chronicle. The whole time, he said, the defendants seemed almost giddy. He recalled hearing from inside the bathroom men and women laughing and watching television. “They were drinking and having a good time while there were people dying in the other room,” he testified. “At this point, my body was broken down and I didn’t know how much longer I could go on. ” Just before nightfall, after being held captive for some 40 hours, the students heard explosions outside, according to the Democrat and Chronicle. A police SWAT team had come to save them. Their roommates had reported them missing, and an investigation led police to one of the women who lured them to the house, the Tribune reported. Neither of the victims appeared in court Wednesday. “The victims wanted to begin to move on with their lives,” Schwartz, the prosecutor, told reporters after the sentences were handed down. “Every time there’s another court appearance or proceeding,” he added, “it’s just a constant reminder of what took place last December. ” More from Morning Mix ‘He died of a broken heart’: Married 63 years, they died hours apart in same hospital room ‘I was astonished’: French doctor discovers baby’s legs protruding from mother’s womb ‘Chilling’: A serial animal killer may be on the loose in Canada, mutilating pets, wildlife"

","        People line up at the parcel post window at the General Post Office to mail their Christmas packages, in New York on Dec. 22, 1927. (Underwood   Images)  According to Sue Brennan of the U. S. Postal service, USPS estimates that it will deliver more than 750 million packages between Thanksgiving and Dec. 31 this year. FedEx projects a    370 million; UPS predicts the service will deliver more than 700 million. For a country of only about 325 million  that means mailrooms across the country and postal workers worldwide will handle more than five packages per American this holiday season. In recent years, this influx has been credited for the rise of online shopping, but as history shows us this surge in mail is as much a holiday tradition as mistletoe and mulled wine. Even during wartime, the U. S. Postal service  —   one of the few governmental agencies explicitly mentioned in the Constitution  —   made every effort to deliver holiday packages on time. During World War I, Army officers established a “Christmas box hospital” for the repair of Christmas boxes received in bad condition. And likewise, the Navy’s ships helped to ferry millions of packages from New York to Europe. While technology has sped up the process, these packages still take time. Even in 2007, carriers still   about 14 percent of letters and 40 percent of flat mail (larger pieces). But that said, you still have a little time to send your   gifts out. The U. S.

","           Donald Trump said he plans to shut down his charitable foundation, a decision that comes after repeated controversies over how it collected and disbursed funds. In a statement Saturday, Trump offered no timeline for when his foundation would close down, but said he had directed his attorney to take the steps needed to close the charity. It was also not immediately clear when the foundation would be able to dissolve, given an ongoing investigation in New York. ”The Foundation has done enormous good works over the years in contributing millions of dollars to countless worthy groups, including supporting veterans, law enforcement officers and children,” Trump said in the statement. ”However, to avoid even the appearance of any conflict with my role as President I have decided to continue to pursue my strong interest in philanthropy in other ways.”              Caption   Trump has been holding interviews and meetings as he prepares to transition into the White House.

","     WEST PALM BEACH, Fla.  —     Donald Trump late Friday publicly praised Russian President Vladimir Putin for attacking Trump’s former Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton. In a striking statement that seems to further align Trump with Putin, the incoming U. S. president tweeted that he agreed with the Russian leader’s assessment that Clinton and the Democratic Party generally have not shown “dignity” following widespread losses in the November election. “So true!” Trump tweeted of Putin’s comments, apparently referencing statements the Russian made at his   news conference.   Vladimir Putin said today about Hillary and Dems: ”In my opinion, it is humiliating. One must be able to lose with dignity.” So true!  —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 24, 2016    Trump’s expressed admiration of Putin came only hours after he released to the media a warm letter the Russian sent him. The Friday night tweet sparked cries of alarm from former U. S. officials and other Trump critics on social media.        Donald Trump has called nuclear weapons ”the single greatest problem the world has”  —   but he’s also made some controversial statements about them. (Peter   Washington Post)   In Putin’s letter, dated Dec. 15, the Russian leader wrote that he hopes he and Trump can act “in a constructive and pragmatic manner” following the Jan. 20 inauguration. Trump was pleased with the correspondence, saying in a statement Friday, “A very nice letter from Vladimir Putin; his thoughts are so correct. ”  Trump has long spoken admiringly of Putin and what he considers the Russian president’s strong leadership qualities. Some of Trump’s incoming advisers have past connections to Putin and the Russian government, including Rex Tillerson, the secretary of state nominee, and retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, the White House national security adviser designee. Trump has so far rejected the conclusions of the CIA, FBI and other U. S. intelligence agencies that Russia intervened in the 2016 campaign in part to help Trump secure the White House. The agencies believe Russia is responsible for the hacking of Democratic National Committee emails as well as the private emails of Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta.  Michael McFaul, a former U. S. ambassador to Russia under President Obama, tweeted Friday night that Trump’s praise of Putin was “unprecedented. ”   So now the   and an autocrat in the Kremlin team up to trash an American.

","      Evelyn Turner is 80 now and a stroke survivor, but she can still recall sitting in a packed courthouse in Selma, Ala. facing a jury that could send her and her husband, an aide to Martin Luther King Jr. to prison for 150 years. The charges: mail fraud, voting more than once, and changing absentee ballots. The trial “was ” recalled Turner, a mother of four. “I didn’t know if I was going to go to jail and leave my family. ” The U. S. attorney bringing the election fraud case was Jeff Sessions, today a   Republican senator from Alabama who is   Donald Trump’s nominee for attorney general. Back in 1985 when his prosecutors tried the Turners and a third activist, black Americans were gaining ground in elective offices across the South. Sessions’s office charged the “Marion Three”  —   named after the Perry County town where the voter fraud allegedly took place  —   with tampering with absentee ballots cast by mostly elderly black voters to favor the activists’ preferred candidates.  Sessions’s team lost the case. After deliberating for three hours, a jury of seven blacks and five whites found the defendants not guilty on all charges. The case and allegations of racial insensitivity figured prominently at a Senate hearing a year later at which Sessions’s nomination to be a federal judge was defeated by a vote of the Judiciary Committee. Some 30 years later, he will appear before the same committee  —   of which he is now a senior member  —   as the nominee to become the next attorney general. After coming of age in the Deep South during the darkest days of the civil rights movement, Sessions has struggled to reconcile the racial politics of his region with the changing national discourse that lifted   legal barriers for minorities. Sessions’s long record in public life reveals a man who has hired African Americans for senior positions who speak highly of him, but who has been sharply criticized by civil rights groups for his positions on voting rights,   marriage and gender equality. In 1986, for instance, when he testified before Congress, he called the Voting Rights Act “intrusive” but “necessary. ” Then in 2006, as a U. S. senator, he voted to renew the Voting Rights Act for 25 years. But seven years later, he said it was “good news . . . for the South” when the Supreme Court struck down a key provision of the law, which made it more difficult for the federal government to protect people from racial discrimination in voting. In Sessions, Trump found a man who holds deeply conservative views. He positions himself as a champion of the working class and expounds the same populist message that has come to dominate the Republican Party: a belief that the world is divided between working people and elitist “masters of the universe,” and that illegal immigration poses an existential threat to the country. A diminutive,   figure, known among Senate colleagues for his courteous manner, Sessions was the first senator to endorse Trump, back in February. Sessions donned a “Make America Great Again” hat, stumped at rallies and tried to coax his colleagues on board. Many of his positions mirror those of the   whether it is building a wall along the Mexican border or restricting immigration from Muslim countries that harbor terrorists. At a 2006 congressional hearing, Sessions said that an entire group of people wouldn’t thrive in America. “Fundamentally, almost no one coming from the Dominican Republic to the United States is coming because they have a skill that would benefit us and would indicate their likely success in our society,” he said. In 2009, he voted against a hate crimes bill named after Matthew Shepard, the gay Wyoming student murdered in 1998, that extended federal hate crime protections to people victimized because of their sexual orientation or gender identity.  As state attorney general in 1995, he argued against a decision by the Alabama Circuit Court to order the state to remedy funding inequities between the poorest school districts, which were heavily black, and their wealthiest, which were predominantly white. He did so on the grounds that taxing and spending power lay with the legislature, not the courts. Sessions’s staff members say that while Sessions was U. S. attorney, he filed a host of desegregation lawsuits in Alabama. But Sessions did not initiate the lawsuits. Rather, he signed off on paperwork from the Justice Department’s civil rights division, supporting continuing federal desegregation lawsuits, which in some cases were decades old. He also signed off on election lawsuits brought by the Justice Department to convert countywide elections to multiple district elections so that African Americans could be represented on county commissions and schools boards. Supporters point out that as U. S. attorney, he worked hard on the successful 1983 prosecution of two Ku Klux Klan members for killing a black youth. Former FBI director Louis J. Freeh, in a letter of support to the Senate Judiciary Committee, also noted Sessions’s “fierce determination” to solve two civil rights murders: the 1989 killings of a federal judge in Alabama and an official with the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. And as a U. S. senator, Sessions   legislation to honor civil rights activist Rosa Parks with the Congressional Gold Medal. But that doesn’t convince Rose Sanders, a lawyer and civil rights activist in Selma whose husband was on the Marion Three defense team. Sanders is adamant: “He is racist to the core. ” In sharp contrast, former deputy attorney general Larry Thompson, who is African American, considers Sessions a good friend of more than 30 years. “He doesn’t have a racist bone in his body,” he said. “I’ve been an African American man for 71 years,” said Thompson, who served in the George W. Bush administration. “I think I know a racist when I see one. Jeff is far from being a racist. He’s a good person, a decent person. ” ‘The  ’    As a young man, Jeff Sessions was active in Boy Scouts and then became an Eagle Scout. (Family photo)  Jefferson Beauregard Sessions III, 70, is a   Alabamian born in Selma. He was raised in a tiny town called Hybart, in Monroe County, the setting for the novel “To Kill a Mockingbird. ” His mother called him “Buddy” to distinguish him from his father, who ran a country store and then a tractor dealership. An only child, he attended a segregated school. “We never knew anything else,” recalled Les Johnson, a longtime friend and a retired banker. “That’s just the way it was. ” Sessions was active in Boy Scouts and became an Eagle Scout. To this day he has the motto “Be Prepared” on the back of his nameplate on his desk in his Senate office. He played linebacker on the high school team. He wasn’t big, “but he could sure tackle ’em!” recalled Kay Ivey, a friend. “Some people called him ‘the  .’ ” The “bottom line,” said Ivey, who is now Alabama’s lieutenant governor, “is Jeff Sessions is a man of his word. If he tells you something, you can take it to the bank. He’s straight as an arrow and believes in the rule of law. Just like in football, when he grabs onto something, he hangs on tight. ” Sessions left home for college, attending a Methodist liberal arts college in Montgomery, Ala. called Huntingdon. He met his    Mary Blackshear, during his freshman year, and they married after graduation. Sessions organized a chapter of the Young Republicans, at a time when Democrats ruled the state, and became student government president. “That quiet friendliness and courtesy to everyone” is what got him elected, said Lindora Snyder, a college friend.     Jeff Sessions met his    Mary Blackshear, during his freshman year at college. (Family photo)     Jeff Sessions as a boy in a toy police car. (Family photo)        After graduating from Huntingdon, Sessions earned a law degree from the University of Alabama and then joined a small law firm before becoming an assistant U. S. attorney in Mobile. After a stint at another firm, in 1981, he was appointed U. S. attorney by President Ronald Reagan. As U. S. attorney, Sessions worked with some minority communities. Robert Battles Sr. who was a neighborhood organizer in Mobile in the 1980s, said Sessions helped set up a “drug court” in the county to help   offenders clear their records. The effort primarily helped black youths who had minor drug convictions.

(Associated Press)  The voter fraud case made national news, and it was emblematic, voting rights advocates say, of a push by officials in several Southern states to try to disenfranchise black voters. Sessions was, former Justice Department officials say, the first U. S. attorney in the country to prosecute civil rights activists for voter fraud since the passage of the 1965 Voting Rights Act. Albert Turner was the son of a sharecropper who rose to become King’s field secretary in Alabama. In 1965, Turner was in the front lines of the voting rights marchers who were attacked on a bridge in Selma by    state troopers in what came to be known as “Bloody Sunday. ” In the 1980s, activists such as Turner sought to raise black voter participation by helping those who could not readily get to the polls, especially the elderly, the disabled, those who were barely literate and those who worked outside of the district in which they were registered to vote. The activists also would drop the absentee ballots in the mail. The case arose out of complaints to the district attorney brought by local black officials that Turner, who led the Perry County Civic League, and associates were taking absentee ballots and altering the votes. At the time, there was a split between two factions, both black, that were vying for power in the county, according to congressional testimony. Sessions testified to Congress in 1986 that the number of absentee ballots cast in Perry County in the primary was extraordinary: 729 out of 4, 000 total. At his suggestion, he said, the FBI staked out the Marion post office before the primary and watched as the Turners and an associate, Spencer Hogue, drove up. Under a court order, election officials secretly numbered the ballots and matched them to the envelopes. “These are the sort of tactics,” defense attorney J. L. Chestnut told the jury at the trial, that make “your American spines . . . tingle. ” Sessions explained what the authorities found. “When those ballots were opened, there was a substantial number of them that had candidates’ names crossed out,’’ he said. “There would be an ‘X’ by one candidate and both the name and the X would be crossed out and an X placed beside another candidate’s name. ” A total of 75 ballots had been changed, he said. Any changes were made by the voters of their own volition, Evelyn Turner said in an interview. Her husband, she said, would tell the voter: “If this is not the person you want to vote for, then just draw a line through it. And he would even make them initial it,” she said. Such voter assistance was permitted by state law. Albert Turner died in 2000. But his younger brother, Robert Turner, 65, who is a lawyer in Marion and was also part of the defense team, is convinced that Sessions wanted to use his brother’s visibility to send a message. “You got a person like Albert Turner that’s out front, spearheading all these voter registration drives, why not put him in jail and see how many people get scared?” he said. Sessions has said he believed the prosecution was “well founded,” and he denied accusations that he was seeking to suppress black turnout. ‘Hospital humor’    Beulah Donald wipes away tears as she enters the funeral for her son Michael, 19, in Mobile, Ala. on March 28, 1981. (Mark   Press)  Sessions’s views on race burst onto the national stage a year later, in 1986, when Reagan nominated him to be a federal judge. Not only did the Turner case get rehashed by the Senate Judiciary Committee, but remarks he had made in other cases emerged, too.  One of the most controversial was a quip he made during the 1983 investigation of the Ku Klux Klan. A    African American, Michael Donald, had been attacked by two members of the Klan, who snatched him at gunpoint while he was walking home in Mobile, drove him to an empty field, beat him with a tree limb, slit his throat and hanged him from a tree. It was the last recorded case of a Klan lynching. After local officials botched the investigation, the Justice Department intervened. Barry F. Kowalski was a white lawyer in the department’s civil rights division when he traveled to Mobile to work for four months on the investigation. In the South at that time, not all U. S. attorneys welcomed department lawyers from Washington, but Sessions was “entirely supportive,” said Kowalski, who is now retired. “He was instrumental in making sure that both the state and federal prosecutions happened,” Kowalski said in an interview. Both men were convicted. One, after pleading guilty to criminal conspiracy in federal court, was sent to prison for life. The other, convicted in state court, was executed. “You get close to somebody when you’re working together on a sensitive case,” Kowalski said. “I got close enough to him that I am convinced that he sincerely cared about solving that vicious murder and lynching of an African American. ” At one point in the investigation, Kowalski told Sessions that the Klansmen had been smoking marijuana and drinking on the night of the attack. Sessions seemed surprised that Klansmen would smoke marijuana, and Kowalski said he teased him that it was the 1980s. To which Sessions replied, as Kowalski remembers: “I used to respect them, but if they smoke pot, I sure can’t. ” Kowalski took it as a joke between two men working on a grim murder. “It was hospital humor,” he said. Later, in the U. S. attorney’s office, Sessions made the same comment, but this time, two other lawyers were also present: Thomas H. Figures and Albert Glenn. Figures, the only black prosecutor in the office, who was also working on the case, later testified before the Judiciary Committee that he was deeply offended and did not think the comment was a joke. Kowalski and Glenn, also white, testified they thought the comment was intended to be humorous. Other allegations of insensitive remarks were aired at the more than   hearing. One witness said that Sessions called the NAACP and the American Civil Liberties Union “ ” and “ . ” Sessions denied making some statements, said others were taken out of context, and at one point said he could be “loose with my tongue. ” Finally, he said, forcefully: “I am not the Jeff Sessions my detractors have tried to create. I am not a racist. I am not insensitive to blacks. I have supported civil rights activity in my state. ” The   committee, including his   senator, Howell Heflin, rejected his nomination by a vote of 10 to eight. In 1995, Sessions became state attorney general. A year later, he ran for the U. S. Senate, winning the seat vacated by Heflin, who retired. Sessions joined the committee that had rejected him. As a senator, Sessions hired William Smith, the first black Republican chief counsel on the Senate Judiciary Committee. Smith said that he never saw any indications of racially insensitive behavior. “Jeff Sessions is a man who cared for me, who looked out for me and who had my best interests in mind,” said Smith, who is now the chief of staff for Rep. Gary Palmer ( . ). “So, anybody who says anything different doesn’t know Jeff Sessions. ‘I should have stepped forward more’    Sen. Jeff Sessions, left, with Evelyn Turner, center.

(Albert Turner Jr.)  In February, Evelyn Turner traveled to Washington to represent her husband in a ceremony awarding a Congressional Gold Medal to the “foot soldiers” who took part in the 1965 voting rights march from Selma to Montgomery. Sessions had sponsored the legislation in the Senate. Civil rights activists and their families, along with leaders of the Senate and the House, filled the grand Emancipation Hall of the Capitol Visitors Center. Sessions rose to speak. “I was a teenager at the time of this march growing up 35 miles south in the little town of Camden, attending   segregated schools,” he said. “I saw evidence of discrimination virtually every day. I think even the youth of our time were aware of the historic events that were beginning to unfold in Selma, but maybe probably not fully understanding the significance of it. “Certainly,” he said, looking out at the sea of faces, “I feel like I should have stepped forward more and been a leader and a more positive force in the great events that were occurring. ”  He invoked the name of the man he had once tried to send to prison years after the march. “Seeing that film [footage of the march] I always see Albert Turner Sr. in the front with his white hat going down when the troopers attacked. ’’ Sessions praised the foot soldiers for their “courage and fidelity” and added: “More needs to be done. We need to join closer hands. ” Afterward, he greeted the Alabama delegation. He reached out to hug Evelyn Turner. But she held him off. “I told him, ‘I don’t want to hug you. You tried to send us off for . . . years,’ ” she said. “I’m sorry you feel that way, Mrs. Turner,” he said, as she recalled. Her son, Albert Turner Jr. who was at her side, turned to her. “Mama, that’s over with. You’re old now. You’ve got to forgive him,” he said. “I might forgive him,” she replied. “But I won’t forget. ”  Michelle Ye Hee Lee, Julie Tate and Matt Zapotosky contributed to this report.     "

","  JERUSALEM  —   In a fiery speech Saturday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu attacked President Obama and the United Nations for the passage a day before of a harsh resolution that criticized Israel’s settlement activity in the West Bank and East Jerusalem.  Netanyahu said the resolution was part of the “swan song of   bias against Israel,” and he compared Obama to former U. S. president Jimmy Carter, whom he called hostile to Israel and the last to break with U. S. commitments to support the state. Carter has frequently criticized Israel’s activities in the West Bank and more recently urged Obama to extend diplomatic recognition to Palestinians. “The resolution is distorted. It states that the Jewish quarter and the Western Wall are occupied, which is absurd,” said Netanyahu, referring to holy Jewish sites that sit within the Old City in East Jerusalem. But Netanyahu said he was optimistic because a new era was beginning in the world, especially with   Donald Trump about to enter the White House. He said that those who try to harm Israel will pay a high price and that Israel would fight to cancel the resolution.      (Reuters)       Israeli leaders on Saturday seemed to be counting down the days to Trump’s Jan. 20 inauguration, hoping he will offer a more sympathetic approach to Israel and bring an end to what one senior minister called Obama’s support for “Palestinian intransigence, incitement, violence and terror. ” The resolution, which was brought for a vote Friday in the U. N. Security Council, declares settlements built on land Israel has occupied since the factions’ 1967 war as having “no legal validity” and being a threat to the possibility of creating two states  —   one for Israelis and one for Palestinians. The   council passed the resolution 14 to 0, with the United States, in a break from standard practice, abstaining rather than vetoing. It was the first resolution adopted by the council on Israel and the Palestinians in nearly eight years.  In a statement after the vote, Netanyahu said the Obama administration had “not only failed to protect Israel against this   at the U. N. it has colluded with it behind the scenes. ” He called the resolution shameful and said Israel would not abide by its terms.      (Reuters)   For the first time since the U. S. election, Netanyahu stated clearly that he looked forward to working with Trump, “to negate the harmful effects of this absurd resolution. ” Netanyahu and his ministers have generally refrained from making public statements about Trump, but subtle words and gestures have suggested that the Israeli leadership is buoyed by the new administration. They now seem eager to see the back of Obama, who has clashed regularly with Netanyahu over numerous issues, especially the settlements.  Roughly 400, 000 Jewish settlers live on 125 settlements and 100 outposts in the   West Bank. Over the past six months, Israel has announced plans to add hundreds of units to existing settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, each time drawing rebuke from the White House. More recently,   voices in Netanyahu’s government have pushed legislation to legalize settlements built on privately owned Palestinian land, a step also frowned upon by the Obama administration. Trump, on the other hand, has indicated he might bring a fresh approach to the   conflict. Last week, he nominated a close adviser and outspoken supporter of Israel’s settlements, New York lawyer David Friedman, as ambassador to Israel. And on Thursday, he tweeted that “The resolution being considered . . . should be vetoed. ”  The potential change in direction might explain why there was such urgency to bring the resolution to a vote Friday, as well as the U. S. decision not to veto it. A White House official, speaking on condition of anonymity about the sensitive internal discussions, said the Security Council vote was preceded by months of    discussions about numerous draft resolutions in circulation. The official said the White House would not back any measure that delegitimized Israel or imposed a solution on the two parties, and would veto any resolution that omitted mention of Palestinian incitement to violence and terrorism. Late Wednesday night, President Obama spoke by phone with advisers including Vice President Biden, Secretary of State John F. Kerry, national security adviser Susan E. Rice and Samantha Power, the U. S. ambassador to the United Nations. Obama said he was open to abstaining from a vote on an Egyptian resolution scheduled for Thursday. But the Egyptians withdrew their resolution after President Abdel Fatah   spoke with Trump, who had been approached by worried Israeli officials. New Zealand, Malaysia, Venezuela and Senegal stepped in and sponsored their own settlements resolution. On Friday morning, Obama authorized an abstention. It was relayed to Power through Rice. Following the vote, Netanyahu ordered a series of diplomatic steps against the countries that had brought the resolution and with whom Israel has diplomatic relations. He instructed Israel’s ambassadors in New Zealand and Senegal to immediately return to Israel and canceled a planned visit to Israel by the Senegalese foreign minister scheduled for next month. He also suspended Israeli aid programs in Senegal. On Saturday, Netanyahu also said he would cancel Israel’s financial contributions to five U. N. agencies. In Cairo, Sissi’s government was left struggling to defend its actions, after first sponsoring the resolution and then withdrawing it. Although it ultimately voted in favor, Egypt drew criticism at home and in the Arab world for giving the appearance it had folded in the face of Israeli pressure. After the resolution passed Friday, the country’s representative to the United Nations said the decision to withdraw had been “procedural” and was taken because of “pressures that the draft has met. ” Among Palestinians, as well as Arab countries seen as friendly to Israel, the resolution was viewed as a victory. Saeb Erekat, a former peace negotiator and the No. 2 in the Palestine Liberation Organization, said the vote was a “clear and unanimous message” to Netanyahu that “your policies will not achieve peace and security for Israel or the region. ” In Gaza, Hamas spokesman Fawzy Barhoum said: “Hamas appreciates the position of the countries that voted in the Security Council for the right of the Palestinian people (to live) on their land,” Agence   reported. Israeli leaders across the political spectrum, however, criticized the U. N. decision. “I strongly oppose this harsh resolution, which is a strategic defeat for Israel,” opposition leader Isaac Herzog said, according to the Israeli newspaper Haaretz. Speaking on Israeli television on Saturday, he laid the blame for the defeat on Netanyahu’s foreign policy. Israel Katz, a senior government minister from Netanyahu’s ruling Likud party said Obama had “reached a new low, when he turned his back on America’s ally Israel. ” “Obama’s decision at the end of his presidency to abandon the political umbrella which the United States has traditionally provided Israel in the Security Council will unfortunately only deepen the Israeli public’s distrust and allow the Palestinians to continue to evade responsibility,” he said.

142441,217910,Should stores say ‘merry Christmas’? Trump says yes. But just ask the shop owners.,Washington Post,Julie Zauzmer,2016-12-23,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161225004744/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/acts-of-faith/wp/2016/12/23/merry-christmas-or-happy-holidays-how-national-chains-and-mom-and-pop-stores-choose/
","     Donald Trump’s path to electoral victory was paved in part with a promise that Santa Claus might make: “We’re all going to be saying ‘merry Christmas’ again. ” Months before he stood on a stage in Orlando as   last week  —   in front of 16 Christmas trees on a podium with a sign that said “Merry Christmas, USA”  —   Trump trained his focus not just on coal country and a wall along the Mexican border, but also on the employees of Macy’s and Bloomingdale’s. “If I’m president, you’re going to see ‘merry Christmas’ in department stores, believe me,” he said. “Believe me. ” And now it’s Christmastime, in the dawning days of Trump’s new America, and the question is: Retailers, will you start saying “merry Christmas”? “That’s ridiculous,” said John Boiler. As the chief executive of 72andSunny, a Los Angeles ad agency that made Christmas ads this year for Target, Google, Comcast and Starbucks, Boiler is   responsible for much of the corporate Christmas messaging in the United States.  Boiler doesn’t plan to heed Trump’s advice. Reams of sophisticated consumer research tell him that “merry Christmas” is rarely the best way to sell the most stuff around the holidays. “To say that you’re only going to recognize one segment of your audience to the exclusion of others is not only bad socially and culturally, it is bad economically. You’re limiting your audience and your customer base,” Boiler said. “You’re going to make the choice that is more inclusive  —   if you’re also into making the most money for your shareholders. ” Of course, most Americans’ preference for hearing “merry Christmas” or not when they’re shopping has nothing to do with the stores’ bottom lines. The country’s debate over whether to say “happy holidays”  —   which lumps in other winter festivals including Hanukkah, Kwanzaa and New Year’s  —   or to stick only to Christmas is just as politically and culturally polarized as so many of our other impasses. In a poll by the Public Religion Research Institute this month, 66 percent of Democrats said that stores and businesses should say “happy holidays” out of respect for people of   faiths. Republicans said just the opposite: 67 percent of them said stores should not opt for a more inclusive greeting. That left the country exactly split  —   47 percent for “happy holidays” and 46 percent for “merry Christmas. ”  It hasn’t always been this way, of course. Gerry Bowler, who just published his third book about the history of Christmas, said most Americans blithely said “merry Christmas,” with perhaps a “season’s greetings” thrown in sometimes, for most of our country’s history. U. S. presidents helped start the “happy holidays” trend by sending out annual holiday cards with nonreligious messages, Bowler said. The trend dates to Dwight D. Eisenhower in the 1950s, though “merry Christmas” remained the cultural norm for decades longer. But in the 1990s, Bowler said, “happy holidays” enjoyed a brief and happy reign, more or less uncontested as the country’s corporate greeting of choice. Public schools preached multiculturalism at their holiday concerts. Bill Clinton’s cards from the White House avoided “merry Christmas,” just as Ronald Reagan’s had before him.  But then in 2004, a California group calling itself the Committee to Save Merry Christmas mounted a boycott of Macy’s and Bloomingdale’s because the stores said “happy holidays. ” And the next year, Bill O’Reilly took up their cause, and returned to it year after year on Fox News Channel. The “war on Christmas,” in O’Reilly’s words, was underway. We’ve been doing battle ever since. The concept of Christmas being targeted played right into the fears of many conservatives, already anxious about demographic shifts that made Christians less of a majority, and about policies that went against their values, such as the legalization of   marriage.  Many view themselves as persecuted in some ways in the public sphere. In a recent Pew poll, 21 percent of Republicans and   independents said evangelicals face “a lot” of discrimination  —   more than the number who said women, blacks, Hispanics or Jews face “a lot” of discrimination. So being told they can’t share their commonplace Christmas greeting has come to feel like another assault. After O’Reilly and other Christmas defenders began waging battle, “merry Christmas” started sounding again in some of the stores that had abandoned it. “It seems to me that the pressure has succeeded in returning ‘merry Christmas’ to the commercial sphere,” Bowler said. He thinks Trump might have something to do with that in the future. “I think he can embolden those who are made shy about using it,” he said. “I think our natural desire to be polite has cowed a lot of people. ”  Consolidation in the retail industry and competition from online shopping have sped up the disappearance of “merry Christmas,” as regional department stores and small businesses closed up shop. The remaining    stores are more able to reflect the desires of their customers in their locales. At Murphy’s Department Store in Stillwater, Okla. the big hit item this season is a butter knife called “That!” which conducts heat from a person’s hand to slice through cold butter with ease. Everyone who buys one hears “merry Christmas” at the checkout counter. “In Oklahoma, that’s still pretty much the way you do it,” owner Terry Monroe said. In   Louisiana, Brad Wright agrees. “When customers check out and they leave, we tell ’em, ‘merry Christmas,’” he said about the Nichols chain of five department stores where he is the chief financial officer. Business seems to have picked up at Nichols, Wright said, since Trump was elected. People laid off from their jobs in Louisiana’s oil fields are optimistic that they’ll be getting back to work. “We’re not worried about political correctness or what some   thinks,” Wright said. “I’m sure there are people in this area that may be Muslim or Jewish. I don’t know. We always just said ‘merry Christmas.’ . . . That’s our Christian beliefs. ”  In the District, by contrast  —   which is not just politically far more liberal than most of the country, but also more religiously diverse  —   retailers who know their clientele, just as Monroe and Wright know theirs, steer far clear of “merry Christmas. ” Call the 65 tents on F Street NW a “Christmas market,” and the man in charge will quickly correct you. “We’re not a Christmas market. We’re a holiday market,” says Michael Berman, the Downtown Holiday Market’s executive director. “Our focus is really handcrafts and small businesses, local businesses: a diversity of both products and what they celebrate. ” Mina Karimi sells decorative wooden blocks at the market, with every imaginable message   and   onto them. For a significant other, someone might buy from Karimi and her two business partners a colorful   that says: “I am really glad that you exist on this planet. ” Or, “You are actually the only person that doesn’t annoy me. ” But for all the dozens of sayings in her shop, there’s nary a “merry Christmas. ”  If there is a war over Christmas, Fay Hobbs Manthey’s store in Alexandria’s Old Town seems a likely front. The Christmas Attic sparkles, glows and hums to the tune of shelves of musical snow globes. Stockings hang, wreathes festoon, toy soldiers stand at attention. The whole room seems to unabashedly shout, “Merry Christmas!” But Hobbs Manthey sees herself not as a combatant in the war over Christmas, but as a peacemaker. “Merry Christmas,” she thinks, doesn’t have to be a term that excludes anybody. “I think it’s part of our American culture. People have always been saying ‘merry Christmas,” she said. “This is more of a cultural tradition than a religious celebration. ” In fact, no one has asked her in the   years since her parents opened a Christmas store, but  —   Hobbs Manthey isn’t even Christian herself. She belongs to no church and considers herself a believer in “all religions. ” She wants any American family, of any background, to feel that they can buy into Christmas. This year, she sold ornaments featuring a   couple. That would have been unimaginable a few years ago, she said. The ornaments sold out. Want more stories about faith?

142442,217911,Five myths about the Nativity,Washington Post,Candida Moss,2016-12-16,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161225004744/https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/five-myths-about-the-nativity/2016/12/16/48625672-c179-11e6-8422-eac61c0ef74d_story.html
","        Jesus is the reason for the season, they say. This is undoubtedly true, but despite what Nativity plays and Hollywood epics would have us believe, the story of the birth of Jesus is more complicated than many people think. Between the difficulty in reconciling different versions of the tale and the 2, 000 years of popular interpretation and culture layered on top of them, much of what people commonly know about the story of Jesus’ birth, from the date to where it took place, is wildly different from what the Gospels have to say.   Myth No. 1 Jesus was born on Dec. 25. The overwhelming majority of Christians mark the birth of Jesus on Dec. 25. But there’s no biblical reason to celebrate Christmas on this particular day.  According to the Gospel of Luke, shepherds were watching their flocks at night at the time Jesus was born. This detail  —   the only clue in the Gospels about the timing of the birth  —   suggests that Jesus’ birthday was not in the winter, as shepherds would have been watching their flocks only during the lambing season in the spring. In the colder months, the sheep probably would have been corralled.  As late as the 3rd century, Christians didn’t celebrate the birth of Jesus. The earliest discussion of the birthday is found in the   writings of Clement of Alexandria, who raises seven potential dates, none of which correspond to Dec. 25. The first record of a celebration of the birth of Jesus on Dec. 25 comes from a   edition of a Roman almanac known as the Philokalia. Alongside the deaths of martyrs, it notes that on Dec. 25, “Christ was born in Bethlehem of Judea. ”  Some have argued that the date of Jesus’ birth was selected to supplant pagan festivals that were held at the same time. But while Pope Julius I  set the date of Christmas (for Western Christians) in the 4th century, Christians did not deliberately adapt pagan rituals until the 7th century, when Pope Gregory the Great instructed bishops to celebrate saints’ feast days on the days of pagan festivals .  The real reason for the selection of Dec. 25 seems to have been that it is exactly nine months after March 25, the traditional date of Jesus’ crucifixion (which can be inferred from other dates given in the New Testament). As Christians developed the theological idea that Jesus was conceived and crucified on the same date, they set the date of his birth nine months later.  Myth No. 2 Jesus was born in a stable. As depicted in Nativity creches and Renaissance paintings such as Giotto di Bondone’s Nativity scenes and Sandro Botticelli’s “The Mystical Nativity,” Jesus was born in a simple stable. Generations of pastors and priests have used this notion as evidence that Jesus had a humble birth. As a theological argument, that’s true. But this particular detail of the story isn’t in the Bible.   Luke 2:7 states that Mary gave birth to Jesus and “laid Him in a manger, because there was no place for them at the inn. ” This makes it sound as if they couldn’t get a room at a Holiday Inn, but the Greek word “kataluma,” which is commonly translated as “inn,” doesn’t mean a hotel in any modern sense. Greek has a different word for a hostel, “pandocheion,” which Luke uses elsewhere in the parable of the Good Samaritan. Clearly, if Luke had wanted to say that Mary and Joseph were turned away from a hotel, he had the vocabulary to do so.  The more likely interpretation, as New Testament scholar Stephen Carlson has argued, is that Joseph and Mary intended to stay with his relatives in Bethlehem and that there wasn’t enough room in the guest quarters  —   typically located in the upper level of a house  —   to accommodate an imminent delivery. So, Mary had to give birth elsewhere, most likely in the main room of the house, on the lower floor. There’s no mention of animals being present, but the detail of the manger seems to be what has led to the image of a stable  —   and many live Nativity scenes featuring farm animals. Myth No. 3 ‘Manger’ is another wordfor ‘stable.’ When people talk about a manger scene, or Jesus being born in a manger, or a star shining down on the manger, it’s not clear they always understand that “manger” refers not to a barn but to Jesus’ makeshift crib.  A manger is a trough used to feed animals. The word is derived from the French verb “manger,” meaning “to eat. ” In   Judean houses, mangers were found both outside and inside the home, sometimes separating an interior space for people from a space where animals were kept. Thus, in the Nativity story, Mary may have had one at her disposal, despite not being in the immediate vicinity of a stable.  Myth No. 4 “Away in a Manger” was written by Martin Luther. One of the most   Christmas songs is “Away in a Manger. ” It is often considered to be a Protestant carol, because of its traditional attribution to the German reformer Martin Luther.  The first two verses were published in the November 1883 issue of the Sailor’s Magazine and Seamen’s Friend under the title “Luther’s Cradle Song. ” The following year a Boston periodical, the Myrtle, also claimed that Luther “composed the . . . hymn for his children. ” But even though Luther did pen “Vom Himmel hoch, da komm ich her” (“From heaven above to Earth I come”) for his son Hans, there are no texts in Luther’s writings that correspond to “Away in a Manger,” and there are no documented German versions of “Away in a Manger” until 1934. The carol’s actual origins are probably in   America. In an exhaustive study published in 1945, musical scholar Richard Hill argued that “Away in a Manger” might have been composed for a children’s play about Luther celebrating Christmas with his children. The earliest adaptation of the hymn Hill could find was in the 1885 “Little Children’s Book,” which mentions neither Luther nor any other author for the song. All of which suggests that the composer of one of the most popular Christmas carols was an anonymous American.  Myth No. 5 Three wise men attended Jesus’ birth. According to the Christmas creche on display in St. Peter’s Square in Vatican City, the   attendees at the birth of Jesus were the three wise men. Often mistaken for kings  —   think of the Christmas carol “We Three Kings”  —   these visitors from the east are described in the Gospel of Matthew with the Greek word “magoi,” or wise men. Nothing about the story’s language suggests that these visitors were monarchs or even that they were three in number. People commonly think there were three because of the gifts enumerated in the Gospel of Matthew: We are told that they brought gold, frankincense and myrrh, but there could as easily have been two, four or eight wise men as three.  There’s also no indication that the wise men visited Jesus as He lay in the manger, as is often shown on Christmas cards. When King Herod anxiously meets with them in Matthew 2:16, he thinks his reign might be threatened by the child they’ve come to visit, so he orders all boys 2 years old and younger slain. Thus Jesus could have been as old as 2  —   a walking, talking toddler  —   when the wise men arrived.   cmoss@nd. edu   Five myths is a weekly feature challenging everything you think you know.

","     Tonight across the Christian world, billions of faithful souls will stop or at least slow their frantic pace long enough to celebrate the birth of a baby boy born destitute and deplored two thousand years ago. Two millennia after that birth, many will again celebrate Christmas Eve with friends and family members, experiencing the joy, hope and happiness that angels promised shepherds on the night of Jesus’ birth. And yet for too many, the holiday season will serve as a reminder of the loss and isolation many are feeling in a world grown too cold, too chaotic and too dark. This Christmas Eve would have been so much darker for our family had God not blessed my son Andrew with a fast recovery from a traumatic fall in September. He recovered quickly with the help of Bellevue doctors and nurses, a strong wife, and thousands of prayers received from near and far from many friends we had never met. Their prayers and blessings helped carry us through that terrible time. It was a kindness that we will never be able to repay. But even as we celebrate the blessings of this past year, we still feel the pain of a mother fighting pancreatic cancer without end, waking up every morning with the hope of stealing one more day from the disease for her children. We also hurt for our strong, independent mother, whose memories have been lost forever unless they happened in the last 30 seconds. We feel for our friends who have lost their jobs, lost their marriages, or lost their way through drugs, alcohol or ambition. It is all too easy to do in this age when the world we inhabit can seem to cruelly crush those standing in the way of quick profits or dizzying change. Too often, the season magnifies the hurt of these losses and creates crippling pain of isolation that is sure to devour us all at one point or another. If the Prince of Peace we bow to tonight is to remain relevant two millennia removed, then those of us blessed by God’s grace must follow the words that defined Jesus’ ministry. When asked whom would find the most favor with God, Jesus surprised his disciples by answering that it would be the ones who gave food to the hungry, clothes to the poor, water to the thirsty and comfort to the sick. Bringing hope to the hopeless throughout the year is the challenge for Christians today, whether that gift is given in prisons, hospitals, food shelters, nursing homes or elsewhere. That charge for Christians follows them not only on this day but also every day of the year. In this season, we find ourselves once again confronted by a harsh political culture that has coarsened our debate and infected Washington for a quarter century. Long gone are the days when seeking common ground was the rule rather than the exception. Republicans schemed to undermine Barack Obama even before he was sworn into office. Democrats continually attacked George W. Bush with a harshness that was unseen in modern politics until the GOP turned it into a blood sport with the election of Bill Clinton. Even before that, the savaging of Robert Bork and John Tower seem equally shameful with the passage of time. After the unprecedented vitriol unleashed in this year’s campaign, I can hardly expect Democrats to set aside their anger toward Donald Trump and join together with Republicans to launch a new era of good feelings. But I will remind all of those in public service who will be greatly offended in the coming year by a sharply worded tweet or nasty news release of a remarkable Christmas story that happened a century ago. On Christmas Eve 1914, Allied troops were sitting quietly in their trenches along the Western Front when they heard the faint strains of “Silent Night” rising over  ’s land. As those German voices sang, Allied troops joined in. Over the next day, casualties were recovered, prisoners were exchanged, killing fields were transformed into soccer pitches, and enemies would embrace one other while singing Christmas carols. That Christmas truce was not universal across all battle zones, nor was it repeated during the bloodiest years of World War I, but if our leaders could serve up just a small portion of the reconciliation shown under those hellish conditions, there just might be hope for them yet. Bobby Kennedy famously challenged his generation to “dedicate ourselves to what the Greeks wrote so many years ago: to tame the savageness of man and make gentle the life of this world. ” To “dedicate ourselves” to that timeless cause is more critical today than ever. Maybe that is why on this holiday night, I just may allow myself to hold out for that unlikely Christmas miracle of peace on earth and goodwill toward men. Let it begin with me."

","   FOR SOME years now, around Christmastime, there has been a   going on  —   promoted if not wholly created by various talky people on radio and TV  —   about a “war on Christmas,” seen as a concerted effort by the disciples of secularism to eliminate or ignore religious elements of the holiday. Now, with a new administration coming to power, the war apparently has been won  —   by the righteous. “You can say again, ‘merry Christmas’ because Donald Trump is now the president,” proclaimed Corey Lewandowski, a former aide to   Trump, who has himself voiced similar sentiments. Actually, we’ve been at liberty to say “merry Christmas” for quite a few centuries; this isn’t like the early Christians emerging from the Roman catacombs into the bright light of freedom. But it’s true that social pressure arising from the effort to avoid giving offense to people of other faiths, or of none, has led to some silly evasions and to a great many spare and uninspiring greeting cards. Probably, though, no amount of training was ever going to condition many of us to replace “office Christmas party” in everyday speech with “holiday party” (the amount of misbehavior being about the same at either). After centuries of use, wishing someone a merry Christmas has become a fairly innocuous statement of good cheer, with widespread appeal. And much of the message in the Gospels does have such appeal. Jesus of Nazareth was a Jew, a product of centuries of Jewish thought and debate over the deepest questions of life. He is revered as a prophet by Muslims, and his teachings are respected and honored by millions who do not accept the idea of his divinity in any way. But these teachings are also often honored in the breach. This Christmas might be a good time to give a thought to passages such as these from the Book of Matthew: “Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth, . . . . Blessed are the merciful . . . the pure of heart . . . the peacemakers. ” Even more timely, perhaps, are these words of Jesus: “ ‘I was hungry and you gave me food, I was thirsty and you gave me drink, I was a stranger and you welcomed me, I was naked and you clothed me, I was sick and you visited me, I was in prison and you came to me.’ Then the righteous will answer him, saying, ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you drink? And when did we see you a stranger and welcome you, or naked and clothe you? And when did we see you sick or in prison and visit you?’ And the King will answer them, ‘Truly, I say to you, as you did it to one of the least of these my brothers, you did it to me.’ ”  A few hundred miles north of little Bethlehem was the great ancient trading center of Aleppo, like Bethlehem a part of the Roman Empire at the time of Jesus’ birth. Today much of the city is in ruins, thousands of its inhabitants murdered, maimed, dispersed to any place that will take them and to some that will not. Few of these strangers are being welcomed by our own country  —   fewer than by our far less populous neighbor, Canada, whose people have spent hundreds of millions of dollars to aid and support them. Blessed indeed are they, for understanding that the true meaning of Christmas is more than a jolly greeting.

142445,217914,Evangelicals side with Israel. That’s hurting Palestinian Christians.,Washington Post,Bethany Allen-Ebrahimian,2016-12-23,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161225004744/https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2016/12/23/evangelicals-side-with-israel-thats-hurting-palestinian-christians/
","     This week, Christmas pageants across the country will reenact the scenes of the nativity; carolers will sing the beloved hymn, “O Little Town of Bethlehem”; and millions will turn their hearts toward that ancient city, where many believe that Jesus was born. But it’s likely most Americans haven’t pondered what that birthplace is like today  —   or who lives there. Bethlehem is the most heavily Christian city in Palestine. Its Arab Christian mayor, Vera Baboun, describes her hometown the “capital of Christmas” and says that between Bethlehem proper and the surrounding Bethlehem governate, there are upward of 38, 000 Christian residents. Christmas celebrations there form an integral part of city life. “Bethlehem is the city that gave the message of peace to the whole world,” Baboun told me in a November interview at a conference hosted by the Middle East Institute in Washington, D. C. “But today, Bethlehem does not live the peace that it gave to the whole world. ” The existence of Palestinian Christians, and the difficulties they face under Israeli occupation in their homeland, is a blind spot for American Christians. Evangelicals in particular are often strong supporters of Israel and suspicious of Muslims but don’t seem to realize that those aren’t the only groups at play in the region. [Mom’s halal Christmas is the perfect antidote to Trump] “I and many other Americans of Palestinian Christian ancestry will often get asked: When did you convert? ‘2, 000 years ago, when did you convert?’ is a standard response,” said Gregory Khalil, president and   of the U. S.  Telos Group, a     and   organization that advocates peace in the region. “One of the greatest challenges that IDC is working to tackle is the perception that the Middle East is void of religious minorities,” said Philippe Nassif, executive director of In Defense of Christians a U. S.  organization dedicated to raising awareness of the challenges facing Middle East Christians. Nassif, who is of partial Arab Christian descent, told me that while some mainline Protestant congregations have begun to recognize and advocate for Palestinians in recent years, American evangelicals display little such awareness. They typically see support for Israeli security policies as an inherent Christian duty  —   while ignoring that those policies have also made life difficult for Christians in Palestine and have cut them off from parts of their homeland. Sen. Ted Cruz ( .) an outspoken conservative Christian politician and proponent of Israel, demonstrated that particular myopia when he gave the keynote speech at a 2014 conference hosted by IDC. A contingent of Arab Christians booed Cruz off stage after he declared “Christians have no better ally than the Jewish state. ” For Palestinian Christians, that simply isn’t true. It makes sense that the Holy Land, perceived as being embodied by the State of Israel, is of particular concern to Christians. And to the degree that many evangelical Christians are conservative Republicans, their worldview matches up with an American foreign policy view that places a premium on Israeli security. But by forgetting their Palestinian coreligionists, American Christians aren’t just missing the complexity of the   conflict, they are missing an opportunity to live out the message of peace that Jesus, born in Bethlehem, gave to the world. Israel gained administrative and military control over much of Bethlehem in 1967, a set of circumstances later formalized in the 1993 Oslo accords. During the Second Intifada, a Palestinian uprising that started in 2000, Israel erected a wall that divided much of Palestine from Israel. The barrier was intended to protect Israeli civilians from terrorist attacks  —   hundreds of innocent people had died  —   but it also isolated Palestine and choked off its economic growth. Bethlehem, and its Christians, have suffered deeply as a result. It’s difficult for local authorities there to ensure access to clean water and maintain basic infrastructure  —   a situation worsened by the Palestinian Authority’s own endemic graft. Residents have relatively few economic or educational opportunities, and even peaceful dissidents may be subject to arrest or punitive home demolition. The wall also severed the connection to their religious twin city, Jerusalem. Christians had once traveled freely between Bethlehem’s Church of the Nativity and Jerusalem’s Church of the Holy Sepulcher. Now they must apply for permits and wait for hours in crowded lines at checkpoints. Arab and   countries have largely taken up the cause of Palestinians, who are mostly Arab and Muslim. That cause has been heavily tainted by groups such as Hamas, a militant organization that controls Gaza, a part of Palestine, and promotes violence against Israel. That’s the narrative that runs strongest among evangelicals, and may help explain their   on the issue. According to a 2013 Pew Research survey, more than 80 percent of evangelical Christians in America believe that God gave the land of Israel for Jewish people; just 40 percent of American Jews believe the same. American evangelicals are also more likely than American Jews to believe that a   solution, in which a Palestinian state and Israel can peacefully coexist, is impossible. Fundamentally, however, American Christians have misunderstood one of the core complexities of the   conflict: that it isn’t simply a confrontation between Muslims and Jews. Christians, too, are caught up in the strife, but typically overlooked. Christians have lived in Palestine since the earliest days of Christianity. They trace their lineage to early   Christians, Greeks, Romans, Byzantines and later, Crusaders. Most now identify as ethnically Arab. But indigenous Christians across the Middle East have only recently come across the radar of American Christians. The Islamic State has decimated historic Christian communities in Iraq and Syria, forcing thousands of Christians to flee their homes. “ISIS put these populations on the map” in the worst sort of way, said Nassif. Recent campaigns inside the U. S. have sought to raise awareness and garner congressional support for vulnerable religious minorities in the region, giving many American Christians their first introduction to Middle Eastern Christianity. This wasn’t the first major Christian exodus from the Middle East, however. There were two previous waves in the past century  —   in 1948 when Israel was established and fighting broke out between Arabs and Israelis, and during the 1967   war. Thousands of Palestinian Christians fled the violence and were never allowed to return to their homes. [The War on Christmas was settled a long time ago. Christmas won.] To be sure, these earlier Christian exiles were fleeing a threat far different and far less violent than the Islamic State. And it’s important to note that Christians on both sides of the West Bank barrier currently live far safer lives than Christians in many other places in the Middle East right now. But even when conservative Christians are aware that Palestinian Christians face difficulty, they tend to believe it is exclusively the result of Islamic extremism. As Baboun told me, when she travels abroad, the question she fields most frequently is about the relationship between Muslims and Christians in Bethlehem. But, she says, “I always tell them this is the wrong question. Because we are Palestinians. As Christians and Muslims, we are living under the same pressure to keep on our daily bread, the education of our children, our daily life. ” Rather, she enjoins, “Ask the correct question: Why up to this point are we not witnessing a peaceful solution between Palestinians and Israelis?” The answer to that question is complex, and certainly both sides have contributed to the conflict’s stubborn longevity. But it’s also safe to say that there is suffering on both sides of the wall that divides Israel from Palestine  —   and that American evangelicals have largely ignored that it is possible to love Israel and to also oppose some of the injustices its government commits, just as it is possible to love America and also oppose some of the injustices our own government commits. American Christians can support Palestinian Christians without giving up support for Israel, as Khalil’s organization demonstrates. It could be as simple as holding a church fundraiser for NGOs in Palestine working for gender equality or organizations that support local jobs to ease the region’s high unemployment. It could mean starting book clubs to read nuanced works such as “The Lemon Tree: An Arab, a Jew, and the Heart of the Middle East” that compassionately weave together the stories of Israelis and Palestinians who both love the same land. It could mean not giving up on the peace process, or even lobbying U. S. representatives to work towards a   solution, which many (though not all) Israelis also support. There is surely nothing more   than to remember the Christians who care for his birthplace and preserve Bethlehem’s message for future generations  —   and to wish for them a better and more dignified existence. I believe American Christians have enough love in their hearts for all who reside in the holy land. All of us, every single human being, are part of God’s family. In this season of peace, it is incumbent upon Christians to acknowledge suffering and to stand for the powerless. Isn’t that what Christmas is all about?"
142446,217915,What the Hanukkah story teaches us about the Trump administration,Washington Post,Danya Ruttenberg,2016-12-23,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161225004744/https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2016/12/23/what-the-hanukkah-story-teaches-us-about-the-trump-administration/
","         In 175 B. C. an insecure, despotic ruler came to power. He was narcissistic and known for a level of extravagance and display that bordered on the bizarre. Despite his occasional ability to captivate his subjects by appearing gracious, he was said to have, in his heart, a cruel tyrant’s contempt for his subjects. Political positions under him were easily bought; he installed unqualified cronies in high positions and quickly turned on one if another offered him more money for the same job. He was quick to anger, nicknamed “the madman,” and it wasn’t long into his reign that he began curtailing civil liberties, restricting the freedom of religion, and pillaging his subjects’ resources for his own profit. Antiochus IV Epiphanes seized rule illegitimately over the Seleucid Empire, including Judea; the kingship was meant to have gone to his nephew, but he took it by force. He allowed bribes to drive his appointments of the high priest several times and plundered the treasury of the Holy Temple in Jerusalem for its gold. In a fury about a humiliating loss in Egypt, he cracked down in Judea, outlawing observance of the Sabbath and ritual circumcision and defiling the temple by erecting an altar to Zeus there, complete with pig sacrifice. He sent his officers to slay and destroy, with an agenda that was less about Hellenism  —   that is, the demand that the Judeans assimilate into the kingdom’s dominant   culture  —   than it was about denationalization, a full eradication of their way of life. As Hanukkah begins, the parallels between that ancient story and what’s happening in U. S. politics are hard to ignore. There are the questions around Donald Trump’s rise to power  —   his connections to Vladimir Putin and possible Russian interference in the election. There’s his cabinet, stacked with donors and those whose positions on everything from minimum wage to immigration, public schools, privatization and the environment could affect us in devastating ways. Trump’s pursuit of his own financial gain seems to be pointing us toward a kleptocracy, collusion with brutal regimes and terrifying shifts in foreign policy. He threatens freedom of speech, assembly and the press, as well as American Muslims‘ free exercise of religion, among his other authoritarian tendencies. Trump may very well sack the temple of our democracy and social safety nets. Like Antiochus, he could eradicate the way of life that has defined this country.  Antiochus’s regime was, needless to say, terrifying and devastating for the Judeans, who had to decide whether to be martyred  —   as many were  —   or to submit to his demands. A small handful of zealots chose a third option, however, protesting his decrees and the complicity of some of their fellow Judeans. After an initial skirmish, the Maccabees ran for the hills and, soon, were engaged in   warfare with the massive Seleucid army. They were outmanned and underarmed; many of the Maccabean soldiers didn’t even have swords and armor. But they made use of their superior knowledge of their terrain: They were light, quick and mobile, relying on ambush techniques and superior tactical skill. Slowly, painstakingly, they beat back the Seleucids and eventually gained their freedom. The miracle of Hanukkah is that an outnumbered, weaker minority was brave enough to resist a repressive regime  —   to fight back, against all odds. They held fast to their ideals and pushed back against the narrative that their faith was a just target for oppression. Their smart thinking and intimate knowledge of their own country was enough to outmaneuver a government bent on maintaining power through force. It’s likely that some, if not all, of the things that many of us fear about the Trump administration will come to pass. If so, our acts of nonviolent resistance may be painful. We may have times of uncertainty and literal or metaphorical cold and hunger. We’re going to have to be smarter and more savvy than we have been, to be resourceful and make use of all the assets we have  —   perhaps not by hiding in caves but by building coalitions, developing protest strategies, creating novel uses for technology. and engaging civic processes and the legal system in new and innovative ways. Black Lives Matter activists are nimbly shifting approaches to focus on local reform and coalitions with other marginalized groups. Houses of worship, universities and cities are declaring themselves places of sanctuary for undocumented immigrants. More than 1, 000 employees of tech organizations have pledged to refuse to use their skills to the detriment of immigrants or American Muslims. Phone calls to members of Congress are already way up, and some former Capitol Hill staffers have put together a public document explaining how to best use local representatives to frustrate Trump’s agenda. Crowdsourced guides for helping vulnerable populations cope with Trump’s policies have popped up around the Web. New apps, agendas and tools are emerging everyday. We are going to have to be quick, light and strategically flawless, and we are going to have to settle in for the long haul.  Before going into the Battle of Emmaus, Judah Maccabee addressed his soldiers, urging them to fight valiantly. “For,” he said, “it is better for us to die in battle than to see the evils of our nation and of the holies. Nevertheless, as it shall be the will of God in heaven, so be it done. ” We will need to be brave. We will need to resist. We will have to make the miracle ourselves.

Don’t compare Donald Trump to Adolf Hitler. It belittles Hitler."
142447,217916,Europe may face a grim future with terrorism as a fact of life,Washington Post,Michael Birnbaum,2016-12-24,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161225004744/https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/after-berlin-market-attack-europe-faces-grim-future-with-terrorism-as-fact-of-life/2016/12/23/6f2f6536-c84c-11e6-acda-59924caa2450_story.html
","  BRUSSELS  —   New Islamic State efforts to sow terror in Europe are pushing counterterrorism authorities to their limits, forcing citizens and their leaders to resign themselves to a new era where attacks may be a fact of life, not an exception. European Union leaders say they have swept away barriers among security agencies and bolstered border controls in the wake of a year of terrorist attacks capped by the assault on one of Berlin’s bustling Christmas markets. But missed signals before and after Monday’s violence raises questions about whether the changes  —   or any changes  —   are enough to prevent a repeat of a year that saw a   in Brussels,    in Nice, France, and shooting carnage in a Munich mall before the Berlin violence that killed 12 and wounded dozens more. A call by Islamic State leaders for their followers to plan and carry out independent strikes against Europe bodes ill for efforts to stem the violence, officials and analysts say, given the practical barriers to constantly monitoring a large pool of potential attackers. The changed terror tactics suggest that counterterrorism authorities may be successfully disrupting larger attacks, analysts say, offering a positive spin to the grim reality that   violence may be inevitable. “We see how the terrorism networks have much more difficulty in planning operations on a large scale,” said   Ould Mohamedou, deputy director of the Geneva Center for Security Policy. The Berlin attack “is not necessarily an intelligence failure, because unless you start surveilling everyone, then these cases can happen everywhere. ”     45 years of terrorist attacks in Europe, visualized View Graphic     45 years of terrorist attacks in Europe, visualized  Assaults such as in Berlin require little advance planning or logistical support, starving authorities of chances to snag perpetrators in advance, even when they have been flagged on suspicion of terrorist activity. German authorities monitored the Berlin attacker,    Tunisian Anis Amri, before the incident but abandoned their chase after concluding they had no evidence to press   charges. Amri’s connections to the Islamic State remain unclear, although a video of him pledging allegiance to the group released Friday suggests at least some level of contact before he commandeered a truck and plunged it into the market stands. Europe’s open borders  —   a cherished centerpiece of the European Union  —   also make potential attackers more mobile than security authorities, a fact underlined by Amri’s apparently successful escape by train from Germany after the attack, making it more than 500 miles despite being Europe’s   man before his death in a shootout in Milan early Friday. Some European countries have temporarily closed their borders this year because of migration and terrorism, only to quickly reopen them because of the economic and logistical demands involved. Top security authorities have increasingly taken to warning citizens that Europe will never be fully without the risk of terrorism. “We can’t ignore the risk that exists. There can never be ‘zero risk,’ ” Julian King, the top E. U. official charged with security matters, told reporters this week as he unveiled a package of measures intended to stymie terrorist financing. “We can and must continue to reduce the risk of attacks as far as we possibly can. ” The painful regularity of the attacks has fueled support for   politicians who want to reinstate national borders and restrict the flow of migrants to Europe  —   steps that would challenge the basic future of the European Union. Critics say the proposals could further inflame tensions and spur radicalization.   At the same time, analysts point to a list of missed connections that may have helped Amri evade authorities’ oversight. European information about security threats is fragmented into several databases, making it difficult to piece together a full picture of suspects. Italy expelled Amri from its territory last year with little thought of the consequences. And Germany’s law enforcement agencies are scattered across the nation’s regions in a   War II attempt to make it difficult for an authoritarian leader to grab power in the capital.          23.

","     Last month, temperatures in the high Arctic spiked dramatically, some 36 degrees Fahrenheit above normal  —   a move that corresponded with record low levels of Arctic sea ice during a time of year when this ice is supposed to be expanding during the freezing polar night. And now this week, as you can see above, we’re seeing another huge burst of Arctic warmth. A buoy close to the North Pole just reported temperatures close to the freezing point of 32 degrees Fahrenheit (0 Celsius) which is 10s of degrees warmer than normal for this time of year. Although it isn’t clear yet, we could now be in for another period when sea ice either pauses its spread across the Arctic ocean, or reverses course entirely.

","        In the darkest season, when the days are short and cold, a special kindness blossoms. At this time of year, charitable donations spike, and the plight of those who struggle edges closer to center stage.     But ask people about the best thing they’ve ever given to someone else, and their memory search stretches beyond the cheery rituals of Christmas. Ask about the gift that meant the most to both the recipient and the giver, and people talk about the most unexpected of moments, gifts that were neither neatly wrapped nor intricately planned.     What rises to the top of the list are impulsive, instinctive gestures, often small and quiet, that carried a grace that couldn’t have been predicted. An old man falls and a stranger offers a gift of presence and time. A sad story on Facebook about an accident and a loss leads a man 1, 600 miles away to offer a song of solace and friendship.      When words fail a woman whose sense of self depended on them, her husband hands her an envelope full of just the right ones.      We start with a gift that soothed the most wrenching of human trials, a solitary battle against a fearsome illness. A   steps in, unasked, because no one should be alone.       And we end with the plainest and most powerful of gifts. When all seems lost, a woman gives a present that costs nothing and delivers all: She decides simply to be near.       Meg Stankiewicz, left, and Maureen Erne at the Bob Evans where they work in Cleveland. (Marvin   Washington Post)  One Bob Evans waitress was looking another in the eye.  “You’re not going to die,” she said. They had spent years working together at this tired breakfast chain, and had always bonded over how much they had in common. Regulars would mix up their names, Meg and Maureen, because they both had brown hair. But their bond was deeper than looks. Meg Stankiewicz had stayed in Ohio after high school, married a wholesome Midwestern boy, had three kids and worked two jobs to make ends meet. Maureen Erne, 10 years younger, had followed the exact same path. But now, Maureen’s life was starting to mirror the worst part of Meg’s. The lump. The doctor’s visit. The diagnosis. Seventeen years earlier, Meg’s breast cancer had appeared. She was 35 years old. Her mother had died of the disease at 45. Meg tried to tell herself she wouldn’t go the same way. She had a double mastectomy. When she singed her wig in the oven while trying to bake her son a first birthday cake, she went out and bought another wig. She marched on as if everything was fine, until, one afternoon before Christmas, she broke down in the baby clothes section of Macy’s, where she realized that if she bought her children clothes big enough for them to grow into, she might not be around to see them fit.  But her children grew, and Meg lived to see it. Her path was to survive. Now, Maureen needed to follow that road. “You are not going to die,” Meg repeated to Maureen again and again. But she understood what it feels like when dying is just one of many fears that consume you.  Maureen couldn’t afford to lose her job at Bob Evans, but in the days following radiation and chemotherapy, she could hardly lift herself up from the couch, let alone put on her polo and apron and spend hours on her feet carrying hot plates. So Meg picked up Maureen’s shifts, on top of her own and on top of her second job as a substitute teacher. Meg kept it up as Maureen struggled through treatment. Through all those months, Maureen learned to put on a happy face until her kids were on the school bus. She watched the envelopes marked “BILL” stack up. She grew teary when all the waitresses chipped in and bought her sons the Xbox they wanted from Santa. She tried to imagine what it might be like if she wasn’t around for Christmas next year. Finally, she summoned the energy to put her apron on and head back to Bob’s.  There, Meg pulled Maureen aside in the break room. “Here,” she said, forcing a thick yellow envelope into Maureen’s hand.  With the same stern voice she had used to tell her friend not to die, she said, “Do not give this back to me. ” Inside was every dollar Meg had earned working Maureen’s shifts. Maureen didn’t give it back. She’s made it to all four Christmases since.   —   Jessica Contrera      Nathan Beachy surprised his wife, Rachel Beachy, with letters from her favorite authors to encourage her to continue writing. The couple is photographed in their home in Indianapolis. (Marvin   Washington Post)  At the end of one year of marriage, Rachel Beachy had a new name, a new job and a heavy new role: supporting her husband while he finished medical school. But she had lost something, too: a lifelong devotion to writing. That had been a daily love for the   Indiana girl who penned her first short story in kindergarten and wrote a novella in college. Now, life had pushed her into marketing and something essential began to fade.  “Writing has always been part of who I am,” she says. That was a mystery to her husband Nathan, a pure  . He posted a perfect SAT math score, but drafting a   note paralyzes him. He doesn’t get writing. But he gets Rachel. “I didn’t want her to lose it, but I had no idea how to encourage her,” he says.  So Nathan went to the experts. In the middle of preparing for the biggest exam of his career, he launched a methodical bombardment on the world of authors.  Scouring Google, he filled a spreadsheet with the addresses of Rachel’s favorite writers. The research was easy. Writing his appeal was agony. But he mailed his first letter and included a stamped return envelope, addressed to his parents’ house. He wrote one or two a day during study breaks, more than 30 in all.  On their first anniversary, the day after Nathan’s exam, the couple arrived late at a rental cabin in the Smoky Mountains, dining on leftover turkey sandwiches from their cooler. For the paper anniversary, Rachel gave Nathan a   scrapbook. Nathan handed her a fat manila envelope. “Honestly, as I gave it to her I wondered, ‘Does this even count as a gift?’ ”  The first one made her smile. It was a sweet letter from Nathan, but not to her. “Mr. Berry, My wife is a gifted and aspiring writer . . . I want to encourage her . . . if you could find the time . . . ” The next one  —   the next six  —   made her cry. “Writing is skill,” wrote Rufi Thorpe, the author of “The Girls from Corona del Mar,” in a long reply. “It’s not magic. . . . You have to put in your 10, 000 hours. . . . Lucky to have a husband who supports your writing. . . . ” “You must expect discouragements, and the voice that tells you what to do then will be yours,” said Kentucky sage Wendell Berry in two pages of wisdom written in a fine patrician hand.  Meg Wolitzer, Chris Bohjalian, Gerald Toner, David Nicholls  —   page after page. A Greek chorus sprang from her own bookshelf, and what they sang was: Write for yourself. “It was the most surreal experience of my entire life,” she says. The next morning at 6, with dawn rising over the hills and Nathan still asleep, she sat down and began to type. She hasn’t stopped since. Finding an hour each morning over the past year and half, that first story has turned into a trilogy of three complete novels. She would like to publish them someday, sure. But that’s not the point.  The point is the writing. And that was the gift.  —   Steve Hendrix       Jonah Smith at his home and studio in Los Angeles. (Ian Maddox   The Washington Post)  Mike Wedeking’s sister, hit by a car as she crossed a busy street in Ocala, Fla. was dying. Mike had always prided himself on being a private person, but sitting by her bedside, he felt compelled to air his sorrow. Across the country, his friend, Jonah Smith, was scrolling Facebook when he saw Wedeking’s post. He read it and reread it, his eyes brimming with tears, until the words read like a melody. Wedeking wrote not about his sister, but about the driver who had hit her. The driver had draped her body over his sister’s to protect her from traffic until paramedics arrived.  Mike felt compelled to share a story he had told almost no one: More than two decades ago, he had witnessed a car accident, the young female driver thrown from her car. Mike had held her in his arms. She begged him not to let her die. He wasn’t allowed in the ambulance with her, and she died on the way to the hospital. Mike had buried the pain and the regret until he sat by his sister’s bedside and watched her die. Smith, a   in Los Angeles, had known Wedeking for nearly a decade. He had played many gigs at Wedeking’s barbecue joint in Des Moines.  Now, as Smith read his friend’s post, he heard the story as lyrics. He heard a voice in his head, the voice of the driver who hit Wedeking’s sister. Smith wrote:   I started crying when he thought to take a closer look   His eyes were teary as he read me like an open book    Just when I thought he would get angry his voice got low   And he was telling me a tale from twenty years ago   “That sort of beautiful empathy and humanity screamed at me and forced me to write that song,” Smith said. “As I was writing it, it felt like a gift to me. ” Smith’s gift to his friend Mike, or a gift to himself? Was there even a difference?  Smith worked on the song for a year and a half, never mentioning to his friend that he had seen the original Facebook post. Then, this spring, he sent Mike a demo of a song he called “Ocala. ” Smith told his friend it was inspired by his story. Wedeking wept the first time he listened to it, and when he listened to it again, and again, and again. In October, Smith returned to Iowa, to Wedeking’s Flying Mango restaurant, a small, colorful eatery that stands alone on a busy thoroughfare, the rich smell of cherry   meat wafting into the parking lot. Smith sang the words that gave voice to Wedeking’s pain. For Wedeking, it was the single greatest gift he’s ever received. But Smith is the one who feels blessed. “Social media is filled with a lot of trite stream of consciousness, but his post moved me,” he said. “That sort of feeling is that feeling I want people to have when they listen to my songs. As I was writing it, it felt like a gift to me. ”  —   Colby Itkowitz     Nema Semnani witnessed an elderly man lose his balance and fall. The man suffered a concussion and broken ribs. Semnani helped the man, contacted the man’s family and stayed with him until they arrived. (Marvin   Washington Post)    If Nema Semnani hadn’t been in Maryland for a work trip, and if a friend hadn’t canceled their dinner plan, he never would have found himself getting a haircut at a shopping center in Owings Mills outside of Baltimore on a rainy Friday evening in September.  And when he left the barber shop, Semnani would never have spotted the elderly man gingerly making his way up a grassy incline in the parking lot. In one hand, the man held out a pizza box, as if to help balance himself. Semnani picked up his pace. His plan, he said, “was just to get there and help him make those final steps. ” Too late. Before Semnani could reach him, the man fell, face first. Semnani ran to him, already dialing 911. As they waited for an ambulance, Semnani tried to make sure the man didn’t lose consciousness. After paramedics arrived, Semnani looked for a way to contact the man’s family. He found an   flip phone and looked up its most recently placed calls. After a few tries, Semnani finally reached the man’s son, listed on the phone under “Rob. ” About 60 miles away, Robert Udoff was having dinner with his wife at a restaurant on Kent Island when his phone flashed: “Dad. ” The voice on the other end was not his dad’s. “I have found your father laying in a parking lot,” Semnani told the son. “He’s in pretty rough shape. ” Udoff and his wife, Lisa, rushed to pay the bill, then sped toward Owings Mills. Robert didn’t think to ask the caller’s name. Semnani jumped into his own car. Why did he follow the ambulance to the hospital? He hadn’t discussed it with anyone. He just did. He thought about the man becoming “more coherent and there’s no one there for him,” Semnani said. “I didn’t want him to be lonely. That’s scary. ” Semnani arrived at the hospital, knowing the man’s family wouldn’t be there for some time. Semnani waited. About two hours later, Robert and Lisa arrived. Robert remembers “seeing this man walking up towards me. I didn’t know why. ” Semnani introduced himself as the man who had found their father. They thanked him profusely. As Semnani left the waiting room, Lisa took her husband’s hand. “We just met Dad’s guardian angel,” she told him. “Everybody says ‘Yeah, I would help,’ but a lot of people don’t,” Robert said. In the months since, his father has recovered from a concussion and broken ribs. The Udoffs friended Semnani on Facebook. They consider him a member of the family now. “I don’t consider myself religious,” Robert said, “but I certainly believe there’s something. . . . I certainly don’t know what. But there’s a reason why that man was there. ” Semnani still thinks about “the serendipity that put me in that place. ” He suddenly had time to get a haircut. He chose that barber shop at random. The incident brought back a strand of memory of Semnani’s mother, who died of cancer several years ago. The old man walking shakily in the parking lot summoned an image of Semnani supporting his own mother’s wobbly gait during her last months. “What I did is something anyone would do,” he said. “If it was me, I wouldn’t want that person to be alone. ”  —   Amy B Wang     Patricia Wudel started as a volunteer at Joseph’s House in Washington and is now its executive director. (Marvin   Washington Post)  She felt lost back then, unsure of what someone like her had to offer. What if the men didn’t accept her? What if she made a mistake? What if she couldn’t make a difference? Patricia Wudel was straight and white. They were gay and almost all black. She had grown up in rural Canada. They had, in most cases, grown up in gritty Washington. She was healthy and in her 30s. They were stricken with AIDS, destined to die. She wasn’t a nurse or a therapist, and yet, desperate to give something, she had agreed in 1991 to move in, as an unpaid volunteer, to Joseph’s House, a home in the Adams Morgan section of the District that had opened one year earlier as a refuge for homeless men suffering from one of America’s most stigmatized illnesses. Every night, she and another woman each worked half of an   shift, staying awake to fetch glasses of water, aid with trips to the bathroom, whatever the men needed. Not long after she started, a man in his early 30s named Hugh moved into the home, which at the time housed up to 13 residents. He was tall and handsome, with intense dark eyes and a voluminous Afro. Tormented by a skin condition that no medication could ease, he was quiet, even reclusive. Hugh seldom joined his housemates when they gathered for coffee or cards at the communal   table. For months, he stayed up each night staring at the small, boxy TV on his bedside table. Hugh couldn’t sleep, Wudel learned, because he feared he would never wake up. And so, one night, she walked into his   room and began a routine that would continue for weeks. “What are you watching?” she’d say. He might answer or he might just motion to the Western glowing on his screen. Then Wudel, sometimes with two bowls of ice cream in hand, would ask if she could sit on a stool next to his bed and watch with him, and he would say okay. Wudel had longed to help the world, or at least a piece of it, since she’d run away from home at 17, disenchanted with a community that claimed to love God but didn’t always love people. Wudel had hitchhiked across Canada, worked in a bar, earned a college degree, gotten married, found a good job, lived in affluence, moved to Washington, gotten divorced and begun staying in a house of   before she discovered, during one night with Hugh, what it took to make a difference. “Why don’t you lie down?” he asked her at a time when many people believed AIDS could be transmitted through a touch or a breath. Wudel didn’t refuse. She crawled into bed between the wall and the dying man, his emaciated hips and sharp shoulder blades pressing against her through flannel pajamas. Neither of them spoke until, at last, she closed her eyes. And when Wudel awoke, it was to the sound of him snoring. Hugh, she realized, had fallen asleep.  A decade later, Patricia Wudel became executive director of Joseph’s House, a position she still holds.   —   John Woodrow Cox  "

","     When Randall and Joshua and Anthoney and Isah and Johnathan Montague spilled out of their friend’s car on Christmas Eve, they didn’t recognize the place he had brought them. The five brothers, ages 4 to 11, have seen a lot of places in the past year. An apartment complex that kicked them out. Crowded rooms where relatives let all five of them sleep on the floor, for a while. A rehab facility where their whole family crammed into their father’s hospital room. But when they pulled up to the brick house in College Park with the blue shutters on Saturday afternoon, they’d never seen anything like it. “We have a surprise for you: this is y’all’s new home,” a friend said. All five boys looked around, dumbfounded. A home of their own  —   the biggest Christmas surprise these boys could receive, delivered thanks to a community that made it happen.  “Through the grace of God, my babies are getting a house, and they’re going to have a Christmas,” Reese said. The boys rushed through each room: one for their parents, one for the twins, and one for the three other boys, where Joshua, 9, did a flip on his new bed. They saw the basement playroom, the kitchen stove stacked with gleaming red pots and pans, the back yard large enough for five energetic boys. And a Christmas tree, surrounded by dozens of presents from their Prince George’s community. Finding a home for the Montagues has been a community project months in the making.     It started last spring, at University Park Elementary School, where the four oldest Montague kids attend school. Devilan Cowherd, the school registrar at the Prince George’s County public school, saw the boys mother, Porsha Reese, leaving a   conference with their father, Randall Montague. Montague, 31, has multiple sclerosis and sickle cell disease. Reese, 27, was walking a mile home, pushing Montague in his wheelchair and toting her youngest son, Johnathan, alongside her. In the rain. Cowherd took in the scene, stopped to talk with the couple, and turned to Krista Atteberry, an involved parent in the school community.  “It really spoke to them, to their character, and what they wanted to do for their kids despite their circumstances,” Atteberry said. “They would be at that   conference even if it meant walking over a mile in the rain pushing a wheelchair. ” Soon Atteberry got to know the couple and their five sunny, rambunctious kids. She learned that Montague had been hospitalized repeatedly since he was diagnosed with M. S. about five years ago, and had to give up his job as a   manager because of his health. She learned that Reese  —   who left high school at age 15 when she and Montague had their first child together  —   had spent the past 11 years raising her boys and was only now starting to think about getting her G. E. D. and finding a job. And she learned what had become the most pressing fact in their life: They couldn’t renew their apartment lease.    The day before Christmas Eve, neighbors furnished and decorated the Montague family’s new home.  (Sarah L.   Washington Post)  Atteberry and Justin Ross, another parent at the school, went to the property management company to lobby for the Montagues. But the company wouldn’t budge; the family and Atteberry say that the manager discovered seven people living in two bedrooms, and refused to allow so many.  In the final days of the school year, the Montagues found themselves on the street. The father was in a rehab facility at the time, his latest medical setback. Reese took her five sons there, and they stayed in his sick room until the facility told them they couldn’t live there. The boys and Reese went to a relative in Northeast Washington’s Trinidad neighborhood, where they slept crowded on the floor in one room. Montague couldn’t stay there, because it wasn’t  . He went to a different relative’s home. “They don’t get to see their father as much  —   they miss him,” Reese said. And then there’s the constraint of living in close quarters, where they have to take a special bus to get to their elementary school half an hour away, and where they’ve always felt they might hit a day when they’ve overstayed their welcome. “It’s, ‘Mommy, when are we moving? ’,” Reese said. “ ‘We want our own place. We want our own rooms. We want to be able to run around. We want to be able to jump around. We want to play.’ ” After the family had to vacate the old apartment, Atteberry and Ross were determined to find a new home for them in the College Park area. Ross combed websites and inquired with landlords on the family’s behalf. An apartment that can accommodate a wheelchair and seven people was hard to find. His own children, ages 5 to 12, were in school with the Montagues, making it difficult to walk away from their dilemma. “Your kids will see them every day. It’s harder to let it go,” he said. “From the first moment, my wife and I realized that we’re just going to have to do something, and we might have to do something unusual to us. ”  Finally, he found a house that normally rents to University of Maryland students, where the landlord was willing to offer a   lease to the large family, with the possibility of extending it. Ross, a former Maryland state legislator, agreed to   the lease for the family, and to pay the security deposit and the first month’s rent. The Montagues will be responsible for the future monthly rent of $1, 500, a bargain that the landlord offered. They hope to manage it through a combination of Randall Montague’s disability check, donations from the elementary school community and, hopefully, Reese’s earnings from the job she has yet to find. Ten days ago, Ross signed the paperwork. Then he called Atteberry: “Now we just need to get them in before Christmas. ” The race was on.    Families work to unload a moving truck full of donated furniture the day before the Montagues moved in. (Sarah L.   Washington Post)  Atteberry asked the school community for donations and the response was dazzling: a microwave, toaster and dishes; 3 bookshelves, 11 chairs and 4 tables; 6 beds and 8 blankets; and 17 towels. One mom said she would donate everything in her pantry. The volunteers found even more items on Craigslist, and moms in minivans spent the week before Christmas driving all over the D. C. area to pick up furniture. “It just seems like this is what we’re supposed to do,” said Ross, a United Methodist who talked to his own children about the meaning of supporting the Montagues at Christmas. “For the folks that celebrate Christmas, for the people who share that faith tradition, the central premise is that you’re supposed to love your neighbor. ” On Christmas Eve, everything was ready. Atteberry’s husband took the five kids to a movie, then dropped them off somewhere they didn’t expect. As the children entered the house with shock on their faces, Montague spoke through tears. “This is where we live now, you hear me?” he said to his children. “Y’all go look around. ” They wanted to explore  —   and soon they would, marveling at everything from the   alarm clock for the twins, to the giant container of cheese balls, to their very own beds covered in snowman blankets and with new pajamas waiting. But before the boys scrambled off, first they encircled their parents. Seven pairs of arms wrapped all around each other beside the Christmas tree. Want more stories about faith?

","     The Radio City Rockettes will be performing at   Donald Trump’s inauguration, but its members will not be forced to do so, Madison Square Garden Co. which employs the dancers, said in a statement after concerns and calls for a boycott surfaced on social media. The company said on Thursday that the dance group will participate in inauguration festivities next month. The announcement prompted some, including one of the dancers, to voice their concerns on social media. Phoebe Pearl said in a   Instagram post that she’s “embarrassed and disappointed” by the gig, according to media reports. Critics have posted the phone numbers of the dancers’ union and the Rockettes’ employer to urge complaints, the Associated Press reported. Believing that participation was mandatory, Julissa Sabino, a member of the Actors’ Equity Association, tweeted that the issue “breaks my heart. ” Autumn Withers, a former Rockette, supported a boycott, saying “take a knee, ladies!” in a tweet Friday.  Madison Square Garden Co. said on Friday that no dancers are being compelled to participate. “For a Rockette to be considered for an event, they must voluntarily sign up and are never told they have to perform at a particular event, including the inaugural,” the company said in a statement, the AP reported. “It is always their choice. In fact, for the coming inauguration, we had more Rockettes request to participate than we have slots available. ” The American Guild of Variety Artists, the union representing the dancers, echoed the company in a statement posted on its Facebook page Friday evening. The announcement “has brought up legitimate concern among our Members, the theatrical community and the public at large,” the union said, adding later: “Fortunately, the Company has agreed that ALL participation in this particular event will be voluntary. We are greatly relieved and hope to work with our Members to inform them and alleviate the anxiety and fears that this has caused. ”  The union also debunked earlier reports that it demanded the dancers to perform at the inauguration. A small group of Rockettes are contractually obligated to perform at scheduled events throughout the year. But Radio City has agreed that performing at the inauguration will be voluntary for   Rockettes, the union said. The Rockettes, who have performed at Radio City Music Hall since the 1930s, have previously appeared in Super Bowl halftime shows, Macy’s Thanksgiving Day parades and George W. Bush’s inaugurations in 2001 and 2005. The dancers who choose to attend will join the Mormon Tabernacle Choir at the   ceremony Jan. 20. Earlier this month, Trump’s inaugural committee announced that “America’s Got Talent” star Jackie Evancho will be singing the national anthem at the ceremony. In a tweet Thursday night, Trump responded to recent reports that celebrities have turned down gigs to perform at his inauguration. “The   ‘A’ list celebrities are all wanting tixs to the inauguration, but look what they did for Hillary,” Trump wrote. “NOTHING. I want the PEOPLE!” The Associated Press contributed to this story. READ MORE: Do it for the country? Or don’t do it at all? The dilemma facing artists at Trump’s inauguration.

","  CHICAGO  ” All season, the Washington Redskins have defied easy description, looking like NFL playoff contenders one week and pretenders the next. On the brink of elimination from the postseason, they chose an overcast Christmas Eve at Soldier Field to stage one of their more dominant, balanced and complete performances of the year, routing the Chicago Bears,   to keep alive their bid for the final   spot. The victory lifted the Redskins to     ensuring the   franchise s first    winning seasons since  . But with Green Bay routing Minnesota to improve to   in an NFC North showdown that wrapped up at the same time, the Redskins didn t improve their standing much in the scramble for the sixth and final playoff spot.

","     Best and worst moments from the Redskins’   win over the Bears on Saturday in Chicago. Best giving spirit: You get a pick, and you get a pick, and you get a pick, and you get a pick . . . Bears quarterback Matt Barkley played Santa for a Redskins defense in need of some generosity. Washington, which entered Saturday with eight interceptions in 14 games, had five interceptions for the first time since a   win over the Cardinals on Nov. 29, 1992. Bashaud Breeland and Josh Norman had two picks apiece, while Will Blackmon set up a Dustin Hopkins field goal with a   return after his interception on the second play of the fourth quarter. Worst odds: Barkley may have been hoping for a Christmas miracle when he launched a deep pass into triple coverage from midfield on the first play of the second quarter. Even Donte Whitner was in the vicinity of Bears receiver Josh Bellamy when the ball landed in the arms of Breeland, who was in slightly better position than Norman for the first interception of the game.   This is what happens when you throw into triple coverage  …     #WASvsCHI https:  .   —   NFL (@NFL) December 24, 2016   Best tweet: It’s scary to think how many more interceptions Barkley might have thrown if injured Redskins safety DeAngelo Hall, who intercepted Jay Cutler four times at Soldier Field in 2010, had played.   Hell im at home with the fam and I almost caught an INT too. @Redskins keep balling fellas 💯💯  —   OG aka CAPTAIN 23 (@DeAngeloHall23) December 24, 2016   Best turning point: Back when the game was still somewhat competitive, with the Redskins leading   in the third quarter, Washington running back Rob Kelley was stopped on third down deep in Chicago territory. Bears cornerback Deiondre’ Hall was flagged for illegal use of hands on the play, and the Redskins made the most of their fresh set of downs. Kirk Cousins scored on a quarterback sneak two plays later and the Bears wouldn’t threaten again. Worst luck: If you started Kelley in your fantasy football playoffs, you had to be wondering what you’d done to wind up on the naughty list. Cousins’s rushing touchdown was his second of the day, equaling the pair of touchdowns by running back Chris Thompson. Kelley finished with a respectable 76 yards on 19 carries, but he never found the end zone. Meanwhile,   running back Mack Brown, who hadn’t touched the ball since the preseason, had eight carries for 82 yards, including a   touchdown run to complete the scoring with less than a minute remaining. Fantasy football is the worst. Best wheels: Cousins outraced Bears linebacker Pernell McPhee to the end zone for his first rushing touchdown of the game late in the first half. The ensuing extra point gave the Redskins a   lead with 1:41 to play in the second quarter and the rout was on. Or so it seemed.   Cousins has the kind of wheels you’d build a speedy conversion van around. QB keeper. Touchdown! #Redskins pic. twitter.   —   Chad Ryan (@ChadwikoRCC) December 24, 2016   Worst  : It took all of four plays for the Bears to make things interesting again before halftime. After Alshon Jeffery beat Norman for a   completion, Chicago quarterback Matt Barkley found Cameron Meredith for a   touchdown. The Bears had answered in similar fashion after Washington took a   lead early in the second quarter, converting a pair of long third downs on a   touchdown drive that kept them within striking distance. Best quarterback: It wasn’t Barkley! Cousins completed 18 of 29 passes for 270 yards and a touchdown, breaking his own record for completions in a season in the process. Worst  : Cousins had averaged more than 20 yards per completion in the first half and the Bears’ secondary had offered no reason to believe that it could cover anyone. Yet, with 34 seconds and two timeouts remaining in the first half after the Bears cut the Redskins’ lead to 10, Jay Gruden opted to have Cousins take a knee.   That knee was sickening. Especially when you consider the Bears are   to make it   early 3rd. There was time to get FG. #Redskins  —   Kevin Sheehan (@kevins980) December 24, 2016   Worst other   (see also: Worst spot): After Breeland’s second interception, the Redskins faced third and four from the Chicago   line. Cousins completed a pass to Jamison Crowder, who appeared to pick up the necessary yards for a first down, but was marked short. After Gruden elected not to challenge the call, Cousins threw incomplete in the end zone on fourth and short and the Redskins turned the ball over on downs. It ultimately wouldn’t matter because Barkley’s day wouldn’t get any better.   Not sure why Gruden didn’t challenge the spot.

Hark! Washington needed eight plays to march 65 yards on its second possession, which was capped by a   touchdown run by Thompson. Cousins completed three of his four passes on the drive, including two to DeSean Jackson, who did all of his damage (five catches, 114 yards) in the first half. Worst rushing defense: The Redskins’ early Christmas gift? Getting to face the Bears’   rushing defense, which had allowed 155 rushing yards per game over the previous weeks. Washington had 29 yards rushing on 13 carries in Monday’s loss to the Panthers. Rob Kelley and co. surpassed that total on their second drive Sunday and Washington finished with 35 carries for 208 yards in the game. Best block: The Bears responded with an     drive on their next possession, but Preston Smith blocked Connor Barth’s   field goal attempt to preserve the Redskins’   lead. It was Washington’s first blocked field goal since Nov. 4, 2012. In addition to the block, Smith had a sack and a QB pressure on the play that produced Norman’s first interception. Best call: Washington added to its lead on its ensuing drive, thanks to a   catch and run by Jackson and a brilliant play call by offensive coordinator Sean McVay. (No, it wasn’t a fade pass.) On third and nine from the Chicago 17, the Bears came with a blitz. Cousins made them pay with a screen pass to Thompson, who scampered into the end zone for his second touchdown of the day.   . @deseanjackson11 is just TOO fast!    yard gain. #HTTR https:  .   —   NFL (@NFL) December 24, 2016   Worst crowd: With Christmas shopping to do  —   and Barkley starting at quarterback for a   Bears team  —   there were plenty of good seats available at Soldier Field.

Cousins’s   scramble on second and nine on Washington’s first possession put an end to that streak, though Tress Way would come on to punt four plays later. Way’s only other punt of the game came with six minutes to play in the fourth quarter.

","     NFL Week 16 Top Story Lines | Injury News Fantasy Football | ATS Betting   [Looking for Redskins coverage? Click here.] The New England Patriots moved closer to securing homefield advantage and another AFC team rescued its playoff hopes from jeopardy in thrilling fashion on Christmas Eve, but the Cleveland Browns may have produced the most memorable game of the day against the San Diego Chargers. The Browns blocked one     field goal attempt in the fourth quarter and Chargers kicker Josh Lambo pushed another wide right as time expired, giving the previously   Browns their first victory of the season,  . The win prevents Cleveland  —   a city that has enjoyed the recent successes of MLB’s Indians and NBA’s Cavaliers  —   from joining the Detroit Lions in NFL infamy as the only teams to go winless over a   scheduled. Still, this doesn’t mean the Browns are, you know, good. The win did come at a cost, the win now puts the San Francisco Niners in position to receive the No. 1 pick in the 2017 NFL draft should both teams finish with just one victory this season.  There were some other losses as well: quarterback Robert Griffin III was knocked from the game and diagnosed with a concussion. He was not the only signal caller to not finish the game Saturday. In Oakland, with the Raiders comfortably ahead of the Indianapolis Colts, quarterback Derek Carr had to be helped off the field with a leg injury. He was eventually carted to the locker room and was replaced by Matt McGloin. From the looks of things on the CBS broadcast, Carr and the Raiders appeared to be in real trouble. After Oakland finished its   win, Coach Jack Del Rio confirmed the worst.   Del Rio says Carr has a broken fibula  —   Vic Tafur (@VicTafur) December 25, 2016    New York Jets quarterback Bryce Petty battled through a chest injury to return to face the Patriots in Week 16, but was taken to the locker room after suffering an injury while making a tackle following a Patriots’ fumble recovery. Ryan Fitzpatrick took over for the Jets and continued their downward spiral, ultimately falling to the Patriots  . Patriots quarterback Tom Brady didn’t finish the game either, but for very different reasons. With New England blowing out New York by 34, the Pats opted to rest their starter in the fourth quarter, bringing in backup Jimmy Garoppolo to finish the game. Garoppolo promptly led the Pats to another touchdown, capped by a run by LaGarrette Blount, his second rushing score of the day. With the win, Pats Coach Bill Belichick became the fifth coach in NFL history to reach the   plateau with one team, joining luminaries George Halas, Curly Lambeau, Don Shula and Tom Landry. Though the Patriots’ rout of the New York Jets was far from surprising, a blowout by the hapless Jacksonville Jaguars over the Tennessee Titans,   imperiled the Titans’ playoff hopes and set up a clinching scenario for the Houston Texans when they face the Cincinnati Bengals at 8:30 p. m. Saturday night. Worse for Tennessee, Titans starting quarterback Marcus Mariota was carted off the field at the end of the third quarter with an air cast reportedly being applied to his right ankle. The Titans later announced that he is out with a fractured fibula.  Matt Cassel replaced him at quarterback and scored a touchdown on his second drive to trim Jacksonville’s lead to eight points. The Jags answered in surprising fashion, with Marqise Lee throwing the touchdown pass to quarterback Blake Bortles in a role reversal. The Jags missed the extra point, but on the ensuing Tennessee possession, Jalen Ramsey returned a Cassel interception for another Jacksonville score. Tennessee’s playoff chances are looking very dark at the moment. And in Seattle, wide   returner Tyler Lockett made a sensational catch but in doing so suffered a gruesome leg injury that led to his being carted off the field late in the first half of the Seahawks’ game against Arizona. Lockett broke his leg on the play and Coach Pete Carroll said after the game  —   a   Seahawks loss  —   that it will require   surgery. Take a deep breath before watching  …       Tyler Lockett injury NSFW #NFL #AZvsSEA pic. twitter.   —   Rob Taub (@RTaub_) December 24, 2016   The Miami Dolphins nearly watched their playoff hopes take a big hit before a miraculous field goal at the end of regulation pushed their game against the Buffalo Bills to overtime and gave them another shot at victory, which they seized on a   field goal by Dolphins kicker Andrew Franks. Franks hit a   field goal with 10 seconds remaining in the fourth quarter  to tie the game at 31. It appeared as though Bills Head Coach Rex Ryan was attempting to call timeout just prior to the kick, but he did not get the call before the snap. The Dolphins’ win means a loss by the Denver Broncos Sunday night will put them into the playoffs with a   berth. Then there was the night game between the Cincinnati Bengals and the Houston Texans. In a contest that threatened to set back offensive football for decades, host Houston emerged with a   win when Bengals kicker (and former Texan) Randy Bullock pushed a   field goal attempt at the final gun. The win gave Houston its second straight AFC South title and eliminated the now   Titans from the playoffs in the process. In the NFC, three teams chasing playoff berths secured big wins. The Packers remained in position to lock up at least a   berth by beating the Minnesota Vikings,  . Quarterback Aaron Rodgers three two touchdown passes to wide receiver Jordy Nelson, another to Davante Adams, a fourth to tight end Richard Rodgers and added a rushing touchdown of his own to set up a Week 17 clash with the Detroit Lions that could decide the NFC North. That would be contingent on a loss by the Lions on Monday night when they face the   Dallas Cowboys. Meanwhile, the Vikings, burned badly throughout the first half by Green Bay wide receiver Jordy Nelson, have only themselves  —   or at least their secondary  —   to blame. It seems that instead of following Coach Mike Zimmer’s game plan to have cornerback Xavier Rhodes shadow Nelson, the defensive backs felt they knew better, and let whoever was on the same side as Nelson take him. Rhodes detailed the thought process himself in a postgame interview, but that didn’t change the fact that Nelson had seven of his nine catches, 145 of his 154 yards and both of his touchdowns in that first half. Strange days indeed for the Vikings. The Falcons clinched the NFC South after downing the Carolina Panthers   and the Bucs lost   to the Saints in New Orleans. Atlanta is now the NFC’s No. 2 seed while the loss by Tampa also gives the NFC’s top   spot to the New York Giants and will allow the Detroit Lions to clinch a playoff berth with a win in Dallas over the Cowboys on Monday night. Currently on the outside of the playoff picture, the Washington Redskins kept their hopes alive with a win over the Chicago Bears,  . The Redskins need help in order to reach the postseason.

","     Police in rural Louisiana say a Walmart employee found a baby girl in a bathroom a few hours after the infant’s mother gave birth to her and dumped her in a trash can. The infant was only about 4 hours old when an employee at a Walmart Supercenter in the city of New Roads in Pointe Coupee Parish found her just after 7 p. m. on Friday, Lt. Shael Stringer of the New Roads Police Department told The Washington Post. The mother, Kyandrea Thomas, a woman in her 30s, was found shortly after. Stringer said a Walmart employee saw Thomas in the bathroom at about 3 p. m. that day and noticed that she was bleeding heavily. Thomas told the employee that she was having some trouble with her menstrual cycle.  At that point, police said, the employee gave Thomas some paper towels and waited outside the bathroom stall, not knowing that she was giving birth inside. Thomas wrapped the newborn girl, placed her in the trash can and left, police said. About 4½ hours later, another employee who was emptying the trash can noticed that it was relatively heavy, Stringer said. The employee placed the trash bag on the floor and found the infant, who was discolored and wasn’t breathing. The baby was revived at the scene and was taken to a hospital less than a mile away, Stringer said. The infant, who is now in stable condition, was later taken to a hospital in Baton Rouge.  “Had it been just a little bit longer, the possibility of resuscitation probably wouldn’t have happened,” Stringer said. Investigators found Thomas, who was taken to another hospital in a nearby town Friday night because of complications from giving birth. Thomas was taken into custody after she was discharged from the hospital on Saturday afternoon. Stringer said she will be booked at East Baton Rouge Prison and will be charged with attempted   murder.   This post will be updated.

142456,217925,5 mistakes Americans are making with their money,Washington Post,Jonnelle Marte,2016-12-20,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161225004744/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/get-there/wp/2016/12/20/5-mistakes-americans-are-making-with-their-money/
","     Americans have a long way to go when it comes to understanding and managing money. A recent report from the financial literacy center at Champlain College compiled state and national data to assess the big picture when it comes to Americans’ financial behaviors. The results were pretty dismal. Americans across the country are struggling to stick with basic and healthy financial habits, such as saving, reducing debt or paying their bills on time. John Pelletier, director of the financial literacy center at Champlain College, said that even the highest rated states likely have some room for improvement. Here are some of the key areas in which Americans may be making some costly mistakes when it comes to money: Not paying their bills on time. About one in five people have been more than 60 days late in paying their mortgage, credit card or other bills tracked on credit reports, according to the study, suggesting that a substantial share of consumers are struggling to keep up with their bills, Pelletier said. (Researchers looked at a year’s worth of credit data from 2014.) The mistake can have huge implications for other aspects of your finances, potentially damaging your credit score and affecting what you might pay for future loans. Payment history is the No. 1 factor that goes into calculating your FICO score, accounting for 35 percent of the equation. So if you stumble, focus rebuilding a positive track record by paying your bills on time  —   every bill, every month.  Carrying too much credit card debt. Some 63 percent of U. S. consumers use more than 30 percent of their revolving credit, according to the research. Ignoring the guideline can cause damage to your credit score. That’s because the   “credit utilization” ratio, or the share of credit a person is using, is the second most important factor that goes into determining your FICO score. People who are looking to apply for a mortgage or auto loan should prepare at least six months in advance by reducing the debt load on each card to below that 30 percent threshold.  The best approach to keeping your credit card debt in check is to pay the card off in full each month in order to avoid interest charges. If you can’t afford to do that, keeping the balance to below 30 percent of the total available credit can still give lenders the impression that you’re a responsible borrower.  Spending too much on housing. About 31 percent of U. S. homeowners were spending at least 30 percent of their income on monthly housing costs in 2014, according to the report. Among renters, 51 percent of them spent at least 30 percent of pay on housing costs that year. A common rule of thumb is to spend no more than a third of your   pay on housing to leave room for other financial goals, such as paying down debt, saving and investing.  In some areas, a shortage of affordable rental units makes it difficult for households to keep housing costs down. But any effort to reduce what is typically the largest monthly expense can go a long way to helping you meet other financial goals.  Living outside your means. Sixty percent of households said they spend more than their annual income, according to the study. About 60 percent of consumers could not come up with $2, 000 to cover an emergency and half of adults said they have no emergency savings at all, according to the survey. That lack of cash can force consumers to turn to more costly options such as payday loans when unexpected costs come up.  “If you don’t have an emergency fund, it can put you in a horrible cycle that can be hard to get out of,” Pelletier said. Tapping their retirement accounts early. About 10. 5 percent of Americans said they have taken a hardship withdrawal from their retirement accounts, according to the report. Some methods of accessing retirement funds, such as loans, need to be paid back with interest. But the move can still slow savers. For instance, a quarter of savers who took out 401( k) loans between 2007 and 2013 reduced how much they contributed to their retirement accounts, according to a study by Fidelity Investments. It doesn’t help that many workers are not saving enough as it is. Some 54 percent of workers have less than $25, 000 saved for retirement, according to the Employee Benefit Research Institute. About a quarter of workers have less than $1, 000 saved. Once those savings run out, retirees will probably be left to rely on Social Security benefits, which may not bring in enough income for many households, Pelletier said.

142458,217927,5 reasons December is a horrible time to date,Washington Post,Laura Lane,2016-12-20,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161225004744/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/soloish/wp/2016/12/20/5-reasons-december-is-a-horrible-time-to-date/
","     It’s freezing. Your schedule is packed with holiday parties. You’ve spent all of your money on presents. And now you’re looking to date someone not serious enough where you have to tell your relatives but just serious enough to know you’ve locked down a New Year’s kiss? Good luck  —   you’re going to need it. Because December is one of the most complicated months to lock down a date with anyone who is not just using you as a   to a holiday party. Here’s why: 1. Everything feels more serious. Milestones that are typically saved for serious couples are front and center when you start dating in December. There are work parties where you meet  ; holiday parties where you meet friends; going home for the holidays, where you meet the parents. It’s nearly impossible to avoid commitment! And that can lead to mixed signals. “Dating in December just feels more serious,” says Anna Morgenstern, a    who works in advertising in New York. “I was dating a guy, and right before Christmas I mentioned I was staying in the city and didn’t have plans. So he invited me to his parent’s house in Connecticut. I’m thinking: ‘Wow, he really likes me. I’m meeting the parents!’ He sends me the train information and goes: ‘This is the train you should take. That’s the same train Juliet is taking.’ I go, ‘Who is Juliet?’ And he says, ‘That’s another girl I invited to my family’s house.’ He had invited multiple women to his parents’ house for Christmas! We had had sleepovers, so I thought it was clear we were dating. But he thought we were just friends. Needless to say, I didn’t go to his parents’ house in Connecticut. But I hope he and Juliet had a lot of fun. ” 2. ’Tis the season to go big. December is a month when you’re expected to get   on eggnog or spiked cider  —   and then do things you would normally regret. (Such as hooking up with that cute guy in accounting.) So why would you want to be attached? “If you’re going into the holidays single, you don’t necessarily want to start dating someone, because there are so many parties and you never know who you’re going to meet,” says Sarah Billstein, 32, creator of the Instagram account Rosé Season. “You want to keep your options open and plant seeds for January, when everyone goes into party hibernation and wants to get their life back together. ” 3. Baby, it’s cold outside. It’s nearly impossible to look and feel your best while bundled up in four layers of performance fleece. “You want to cuddle, but you don’t necessarily want to go out because you’d rather be on your couch drinking wine, watching movies and eating,” Billstein says. The only problem? It’s hard to find a cuddle buddy if you’re too cold to leave the couch. 4. To give a gift   …     or not? Most people are already strapped for cash after splurging on presents for family members, charitable giving and yearly bonuses for their doorman or landlord. Do you really want to buy a gift for the person you just started seeing? What if they get you something and you’re  ? This is a similar conundrum to meeting someone the week before Valentine’s Day. 5. You see things through   and   glasses. The sparkle of the Christmas tree, the romantic holiday duets playing in every store. It’s hard to not get sentimental and crave a cuddle buddy  —   even if that buddy is not the right one. “I had been going back and forth for a week with a guy I met on Bumble. I had a really good feeling about him from our texting conversations,” says Katie Haller, 28, the social media manager for   subscription service BarkBox. On their first date, they had zero chemistry. “But for some reason, I stayed for a   date. I built this guy up so much because of the pressure to be in a relationship during the holidays that I was completely let down. ” The holidays can even make party boys seem serious  —   for a nanosecond. “My    hometown hookup for 10 years confessed his feelings for me right before the holidays, and it led to him spending them with me and my family. As soon as the holidays were over, he acted like the same person he was years ago  —   a party boy not interested in settling down,” Billstein says. “After the holidays are over, the blinders come off, the Christmas trees die, the lights go out and so do those   thoughts. You realize they’re the same person you broke up with. ” Although it may feel like Cupid is against you in December, fear not  —   there is hope. I’m living proof! I met my husband in December at a holiday party. Three days later we had our first date, and five days later we had our first kiss. We avoided the awkward commitment and seriousness associated with dating in December because we did not exchange presents or meet each other’s parents. But he was my New Year’s Eve kiss, and shortly after, he was my official boyfriend. Nearly five years later, we were married. It may be a tricky month to date, but it makes the payoff all the more rewarding.

"," Obviously that carved rhino horn for sale at a foreign marketplace should not come home with you. Nor should the leopard skin, the narwhal tusk and the whale meat. But what about the queen conch from your Caribbean holiday or the caviar from the London airport   shop? Not so obvious, is it? Travelers  —   and that special subgroup of shoppers who travel  —   need know which wildlife items are permitted into the States and which ones are banned. The exotic animal test is unreliable. Many less toothy animals, birds, reptiles, plants, fish and shells are legally protected. Choose your souvenirs unwisely and the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service could confiscate your purchases upon your return. The issue has implications beyond simply wasting money. Wildlife trafficking threatens the sustainability and survival of hundreds of species worldwide. Many nefarious individuals and groups, such as poachers, corrupt government officials and organized crime syndicates, benefit from these illegal sales. Buying that $4 tortoise ring doesn’t seem so innocent anymore. “There is no way the general consumer has any way of knowing how it was obtained,” said   Holmes, a senior wildlife inspector with the agency. An array of state, federal and international laws regulates the wildlife trade. One of the most prominent accords is the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) which counts nearly every country as a member. Species listed under CITES Appendix I are the most   and the treaty has placed a   ban on commercial goods exploiting these animals. Members of this club include sea turtles, cheetahs, tigers and black rhinos. There is more wiggle room with species categorized under Appendix II and Appendix III, as long as the traveler obtains the proper permit or certificate. For instance, under the personal baggage exemption rule, you can carry a “reasonable” amount of an item. But some species are not eligible for this exemption and not all countries recognize it.  Wildlife protection experts advise travelers to familiarize themselves with the laws before upcoming trips. Start with the service’s “Traveling to the Caribbean” and “Tips for Travelers,” and the International Fund for Animal Welfare’s “Stopping the Illegal Wildlife Trade. ” Sample advise: Under the heading “Please Don’t Buy,” IFAW urges people to avoid handbags, shoes, watch straps and belts made of reptile skins. For any lingering questions, contact the Fish and Wildlife Service office at your return port. Of course, much of the thrill of shopping involves spontaneous discoveries. Before you departed for Australia, you probably didn’t know how great the Crocodile Dundee hat would look on your head. Reputable retailers should know the legal status and origin of the wildlife items they are selling and provide you with a document to present at customs. Unfortunately, employees might not always be   in the laws governing their clothing, crafts or jewelry. But that won’t stop them from attaching a price tag to the object. “Just because it’s for sale,” Holmes said, “doesn’t mean it’s legal. ” To avoid the risk, the agent offers a simple solution: “Don’t buy wildlife. Buy a magnet, buy a  . ” To learn from other travelers’ mistakes, here are some examples of banned items that are now the property of the Fish and Wildlife Service.

","  KABUL  —   Three men slumped on their cots in a clean but cramped dormitory room. They looked glum and shellshocked, as if they had suddenly found themselves in a forbidding foreign place.  In many ways, they had.  Javed Hakimi, Mohsen Amiri and Navid Mohammedi were among 45 unhappy passengers who arrived here under guard on a charter flight from Frankfurt last week. It was the first of many such flights that are expected to return thousands of Afghan asylum seekers from Germany under a European Union agreement with President Ashraf Ghani.   Across Western Europe, as many as 80, 000 Afghans eventually may be repatriated after their asylum applications are rejected, under the agreement signed by Ghani and E. U. officials in October. After the flight from Frankfurt landed, some of the passengers headed for buses home. But these three had no one waiting for them. They said their immediate families live in Germany, and that once their   stay at a government rest house ends next week, they will have nowhere to go. “I am completely alone here,” said Amiri, 35, who said he survived a shipwreck off Greece in 2012 while trying to reach his mother and siblings in Germany. “I was a   person there, and I was training to be a house painter, but they rejected my asylum case and said I had to go home. This is not my home. I don’t even know where to start looking. ”  To German officials, these were the easiest foreigners to legally remove amid a chaotic surge of refugees from Syria, Iraq and other countries that has overwhelmed many countries and generated an angry backlash across Europe. All the Afghans had arrived illegally, some had committed crimes in Germany, and none were found to qualify for political asylum. To Afghan officials, these men will become a burden that the poor,   country cannot afford. Hundreds of thousands of longtime war refugees are pouring back from   Pakistan; large numbers of rural families have been displaced by the Taliban and are living in camps.  “This is a real crisis for us,” said Rohullah Hashimi, an official at the Afghan ministry responsible for refugees. “We pleaded with the Europeans to only send those who wanted to come voluntarily, but there was a lot of pressure for us to take back more. ” Many Afghans sold everything before they left their country, and they have returned penniless. With no prospects, he said, they may try to reach Europe again or even join the insurgents. Hakimi, 57, spent more than 20 years in Germany, where he married and raised two daughters, but his criminal record made him a high priority for the new return policy. He was once convicted of drug dealing there and was imprisoned for two years, then deported to Afghanistan.  Last year, he sneaked back, paying smugglers to guide him across half a dozen countries. He was working in his brother’s restaurant in Hamburg two weeks ago when he received a notice to report to the police. His lawyer said it was probably a routine matter. Instead he learned he was about to be put on a plane. “Yes, they accused me of selling drugs, but I served my time in prison, and I wanted to be with my family again,” Hakimi said. He said one man slated for the same flight had killed someone but was allowed to stay at the last minute after a church said he had converted to Christianity and repented. Mohammedi, 21, has even fewer ties to Afghanistan, having grown up in Iran, where his family had fled to escape civil war. He said they faced harassment there and encouraged him to go and live with an uncle in Germany. In 2011, at age 16, he made the hazardous journey across mountain forests and open water, winding up at a train station in Paris late at night.  “I bought a ticket to Frankfurt and was so exhausted I fell asleep on the train,” Mohammedi said. “A policeman woke me up and asked where I was from. I told him Afghanistan, and he said to me in Dari, ‘Don’t worry; you’re safe now. You’re in Germany.’ ” As a minor, Mohammedi said, he was sent to school and given a multiyear visa. But several weeks ago, he said, he was suddenly informed that his asylum claim had been rejected and was asked whether he wanted to go home. “Three times I told them no, but they sent me anyway,” he said. His family is still in Iran. Until recently, Germany was sending back only Afghans who would go voluntarily, but after being flooded with nearly 900, 000 migrants in 2015, the government decided to speed asylum processing for those fleeing civil wars, such as Syrians, and step up the deportation of others less likely to win asylum cases, including many Afghans.   This year, Germany has deported a record 23, 750 asylum seekers. More than 200, 000 foreigners have pending deportation orders, including 12, 500 Afghans.   Under the E. U. agreement with Kabul, German officials said they will focus on individuals with criminal records and recent illegal entries, and avoid returning those from unsafe regions of Afghanistan. But the policy has aroused anger among Afghan expatriates, who protested at the Frankfurt airport when the first plane departed. Afghan officials said they had little to offer the new arrivals except food and shelter for a few days, subsidized by the nonprofit International Organization for Migration, which is also providing those without homes a   payment of about $600.  “It’s not much to start a new life,” said Hashimi, the government official. “We can offer them some guidance and positive morale, but anything else is beyond our capacity. ” Amiri, who was happily reunited with his family in Germany four years ago, seemed the most undone by his abrupt deportation. He recounted in vivid detail his harrowing journey from Afghanistan, when an overloaded smuggler’s boat from Turkey capsized near the shores of Greece. “It was the middle of the night, the boat was too crowded and the water was very turbulent. We all started swimming, and I finally reached the banks, but five people drowned, including three children,” he said. “It was May 20, 2012. The date is engraved in my mind. ” The German government was welcoming at the time, Amiri said, but when he was being deported, it was a different story. “The police searched me many times and took all my money at the airport,” he said. “On the plane, there were more police than passengers, and they treated us like terrorists, even following us to the bathroom. ” After this first flight, Afghan officials said, the deportations will be halted for the Christmas season. The second group will arrive in January.          "

","  JERUSALEM  —   Israel summoned to Jerusalem on Sunday, Christmas Day, ambassadors representing countries that voted in favor of a U. N. Security Council resolution that harshly criticizes Israeli settlement activity, calling them an obstacle to peace.  Ambassadors of four of the five permanent Security Council members  —   the United Kingdom, China, France, Russia  —   as well as nonpermanent members with diplomatic relations with Israel  —   Egypt, Japan, New Zealand, Uruguay, Ukraine and Spain  —   were issued a sharp reprimand by Israeli Foreign Ministry officials.  The resolution, which passed Friday, declares that Israeli settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem have “no legal validity” and constitute a “flagrant violation under international law. ” It also called the settlements a major obstacle to achieving the   solution and peace with the Palestinians.  Fourteen of the 15 members of the Security Council voted in favor of the resolution. The United States, breaking with a   policy of preventing resolutions dealing with Israel, did not use its veto powers to stop the resolution’s passage, abstaining from the vote instead.  [U. S. declines to veto U. N. Security Council resolution for Israel to stop Jewish settlement activity]       (Reuters)    The U. S. ambassador to Israel, Daniel Shapiro, was not summoned to Jerusalem because the United States did not vote in favor of the resolution, Foreign Ministry spokesman Emmanuel Nahshon said.  The summons were ordered by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is also the country’s foreign minister, as part of a series of diplomatic measures announced since the resolution was adopted.  On Friday, Netanyahu recalled Israel’s ambassadors to New Zealand and Senegal, canceled scheduled trips to Israel by the Senegalese foreign minister and Ukraine’s prime minister. He also said that Israeli aid to Senegal would be canceled and that contributions Israel makes to five U. N. agencies would be halted.  In a cabinet meeting Sunday, Netanyahu told his ministers that he shared their feelings of anger and frustration at the U. N. adopting a resolution hostile to Israel.  And he laid blame for the resolution squarely on the shoulders of President Obama.  [Netanyahu blasts U. N. Obama over West Bank settlements resolution]   “I have no doubt that the Obama administration initiated it, stood behind it and coordinated the wording,” Netanyahu said. He said the resolution contradicted a U. S. policy and a commitment made by Obama in 2011 not to try to impose the terms of a final status agreement on Israel.  “Over decades, American administrations and Israeli governments had disagreed about settlements, but we agreed that the Security Council was not the place to resolve this issue,” he said. “As I told John Kerry on Thursday, friends don’t take friends to the Security Council. ”  Netanyahu’s anger was matched by more militant voices in his   government.  Education Minister Naftali Bennett, head of the ultranationalist Jewish Home party, held a news conference at the Western Wall in Jerusalem, one of Judaism’s holiest sites, saying the city has been the eternal capital of Jews for 3, 000 years.  He said that in response to the resolution, Israel should evaluate its approach to the 1994 Oslo Accords, which sets out the plan of two states, one of Israelis and one for Palestinians. He said that Israel should instead impose sovereignty on land it captured after the 1967 war. He also urged the government to ramp up construction in Israeli settlements, built on land the Palestinians hope to use for a state.  Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman, head of the Yisrael Beitenu faction, announced Sunday that he was suspending all    communication with the Palestinian Authority in wake of the U. N. vote.  “The behavior of the prime minister and other ministers reflects the hysteria in Israel every time there is something that contradicts this government’s policy,” said Dan Miodownik, a professor of political science and international relations at Hebrew University of Jerusalem.  Miodownik said that what is more interesting is what was not said.  “Israel has not recalled its ambassadors in Russian and China and even though Israel has been growing ties with Putin, it is blaming the U. S. for abstaining, and has no words about Russia or China who supported the resolution,” he said.  Miodownik said that Netanyahu’s actions were, for the most part, hollow with the main goal of trying to placate Israel’s right wing, which advocates for the Israeli settlement enterprise.  About 400, 000 Jewish settlers live on 125 settlements and 100 outposts in the   West Bank. Over the past six months, Israel has announced plans to add hundreds of units to existing settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, each time drawing rebuke from the White House.  More recently,   voices in Netanyahu’s government have been pushing legislation to legalize settlements built on privately owned Palestinian land, a step also frowned upon by the Obama administration.  The U. S. abstention Friday was a rare rebuke to Israel, and it reflected mounting frustration in the Obama administration over settlement growth that the United States, as well as many others in the international community, considers an obstacle to peace.  With Obama’s time in office due to end in under a month, his decision not to veto was a   symbolic statement of that displeasure and a sense of exasperation that the time has come for two states to be carved out of the contested land.  The resolution had initially been brought Thursday by the Egyptians but was withdrawn after President Abdel Fatah   spoke with   Donald Trump, who had been approached by worried Israeli officials.  New Zealand, Malaysia, Venezuela and Senegal stepped in and sponsored their own settlements resolution instead.  A White House official, speaking on the condition of anonymity about the sensitive internal discussions, said the Security Council vote was preceded by months of    discussions about numerous draft resolutions. And only on Friday morning did Obama authorize an abstention.  In a strongly worded statement Friday, Netanyahu said that Obama had “not only failed to protect Israel against this   at the U. N. it has colluded with it behind the scenes. ”  He also stated clearly that he looked forward to working with Trump “to negate the harmful effects of this absurd resolution. ”  “Netanyahu’s   that this resolution is going to be changed, or reversed by Trump is totally unfounded, if he really thinks it can then he is either panicking or plainly misleading,” said Alon Pinkas, a former diplomat and adviser to Israeli prime ministers.  Pinkas said the resolution was unlikely to have any immediate consequences but that it would a precedent on Israel and its settlements.       "

","  MOSCOW  —   It was the second national tragedy in less than a week, once again played out in agonizing detail on national television, once again in the shadow of Russia’s military involvement in Syria. Once again, the nation was left with more questions than answers. Early Sunday, a Russian military passenger plane carrying dozens of members of the Red Army Choir and a beloved and prominent charity worker plunged into the Black Sea minutes after it took off en route to a military base in Syria. All 92 people on board are believed to have died. The crash shook Russia six days after its ambassador to Turkey, Andrei Karlov, was killed in public by a man who shouted about the war in Syria after the shooting.  The assassination was captured live on video that was sent around the world. Russian and Turkish investigators are still trying to figure out whether the gunman, a    Turkish police officer, acted alone.  As of Sunday evening, the cause of the plane crash had not been determined. Though officials were saying terrorism was not seen as the likely cause, Russia’s special Investigative Committee, which opened a criminal inquiry, was considering all possibilities.    “Of course, the entire spectrum and almost any possible causes . . . are being probed, but it is premature now to speak about this” as a terrorist act, Transport Minister Maxim Sokolov told reporters in Sochi, the Black Sea resort where the plane had made a refueling stop.   Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov, a military spokesman, told reporters in Moscow that no one survived after the aging   jet, which had set out from Moscow, crashed shortly after taking off from the Sochi airport. The plane did not send a distress signal.  The pilot was “” Konashenkov said, and the      jet had been serviced recently.   In nationally televised comments, Russian President Vladimir Putin declared Monday a national day of mourning and said the cause of the crash would be carefully investigated.   Throughout the day,   legislators and Defense Ministry officials assured the public that a terrorist could never have made it onto the heavily guarded airfield outside Moscow where the jet first took off. Later, officials revealed that the plane had been scheduled to refuel at the military base in Mozdok, Russia, but had been rerouted to Sochi because of inclement weather. The Interfax news agency quoted a military source as saying the airport in Sochi, site of the 2014 Olympics, also has increased security.

142465,217947,Your future commute: Flying through tubes at 760 mph,Washington Post,Vivek Wadhwa,2016-12-20,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161226000056/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/innovations/wp/2016/12/20/your-future-compete-flying-through-tubes-at-760-mph/
","     Picture the commute of the future: You live in Palo Alto, Calif. but work 350 miles away in Los Angeles. After your morning latte, you click on a smartphone app to summon your digital chauffeur. An autonomous car shows up at your front door three minutes later to drive you to a Hyperloop station in downtown Mountain View, where a pod then transports you through a vacuum tube at 760 mph. When you reach the Pasadena station, another   car awaits to take you to your office. You reach your destination in less than an hour. That is the type of scenario that Hyperloop Transportation Technologies (HTT) chief executive Dirk Ahlborn laid out for me as we were preparing to speak together on a panel at the Knowledge Summit in Dubai on Dec. 5.  He was not talking about something that would happen in the next century; he expects the first of these systems to be operational in the United Arab Emirates by 2020. The Abu Dhabi government has just announced that it has been working with his company to connect Abu Dhabi and Al Ain, two UAE cities separated by 105 miles, using the Hyperloop system. A proposal for this mode of transportation came from Elon Musk in August 2013, in a paper titled “Hyperloop Alpha. ” Musk envisaged a mass transit system in which trains travel as fast as 760 mph in pressurized capsule pods. These would ride on an air cushion in steel tubes and be driven by linear induction motors and air compressors. He claimed that the system would be safer, faster and cheaper than trains, cars boats and supersonic planes, for distances of up to at least 900 miles, and said that it would be resistant to earthquakes and generate more energy through its solar panels than it would use. Straight out of science fiction it may be, but two   took up Musk’s challenge to develop the technology: HTT and Hyperloop One. These companies have raised more than $100 million each and say they will have operational systems in three to four years and that they have governments backing them. Hyperloop One demonstrated elements of the technology in the Las Vegas desert in May 2016.  The sheiks I spoke with in Dubai were most excited about HTT’s system. Even if the Hyperloop technology doesn’t pan out, the digital chauffeurs surely are coming.   cars such as the Tesla that I drive can already take control of the wheel on highways and are able to monitor traffic around them better than humans can  —   because their sensors enable them to see in 360 degrees and communicate with each other to negotiate rights of way. By 2020,   cars will have progressed so far that they can drive safely at speeds as fast as 200 mph in their own partitioned lanes on highways. In these circumstances, the commute to Los Angeles from San Francisco would take only an hour and a half  —   without the need to catch a connection to a supersonic pod. From Abu Dhabi to Al Ain or Dubai could take the car 30 to 40 minutes, door to door. In other words, Elon Musk’s   cars and HTT’s   Hyperloops may be competing with each other. I’m one of those who would prefer the convenience of having their car come with them so that they can keep extra stuff in the back and be working uninterrupted on the commute. In any case, for longer journeys, say from New York or San Francisco to Miami, catching a Hyperloop will make more sense than riding in the   car. The point, though, is that we are on the verge of a revolution in transportation.  For decades  —   actually, centuries  —   we have been dependent on locomotives and, more recently, airplanes to take us long distances. The technologies have hardly advanced. The entire industry is about to be disrupted. Many of us will choose to take the shared cars and Hyperloops; others will own their own cars. But we will take fewer rides in trains and planes. That is why new   transportation systems, such as the one that California has long been debating, are not sensible investments to make. By the time they are complete, our modes of mass transportation will have changed. The California project aims to move 20 to 24 million passengers a year from downtown L. A. to downtown San Francisco, through California’s Central Valley, in 2 hours 40 minutes. It is projected to cost an estimated $64 billion when completed by about 2030. By then, we will be debating whether human beings should be allowed to drive cars, and public rail systems will be facing bankruptcy because of cheaper and better alternatives. The wise investment to make will be in accelerating adoption of   cars and in reserving lanes for them, and in building     transportation systems that do not consume even more time, money and arable land than we have lost already. For distances in the hundreds or thousands of miles, we’d do well to explore Hyperloops and other environmentally sensitive modes of mass transportation. They may be far more   than laying new railways. Read more from The Washington Post’s Innovations section. "

","     Five days after A&E announced a documentary series about the Ku Klux Klan, the network has abruptly canceled the project. In a statement released on Christmas Eve, an A&E spokesman said the network learned that the show’s producers  —   from a   production company  —   made cash payments to “facilitate access” to participants, which violates A&E policy. The   series, which was scheduled to air in January, was “intended to serve as a close look at   extractors focused on helping people leave the Ku Klux Klan  —   the racist hate group with a long history of violence against African Americans and others. ” “We had previously provided assurances to the public and to our core partners  —   including the   League and Color of Change  —   that no payment was made to hate group members, and we believed that to be the case at the time,” the statement said. “We have now decided not to move forward with airing this project. ” Though some reality TV producers do pay their subjects, the network emphasized that it is against this practice for documentaries. “A&E takes the authenticity of its documentary programming and the subject of racism, hatred and violence very seriously,” the statement added. “Just because this particular show goes away, the issues of hate in America do not. ” The series, originally titled “Generation KKK,” was described as a    series look at four prominent Klan families, each of which had a member trying to escape the organization. Producers would also spotlight peace activists who tried to help members leave. A&E, the network known for shows such as “Intervention” and “Scientology and the Aftermath,” caused an uproar last week when the show was first revealed. Some argued that any series about the KKK, even about people leaving, normalized the hate group. They see this as particularly troubling after an ugly presidential election campaign and the victory of Republican Donald Trump, which was followed by a wave of hate crimes. In the wake of the backlash against the A&E series, the network responded that it would change the name to “Escaping the KKK: A Documentary Series Exposing Hate in America,” in order “to ensure that no one can mistake its intent and that the title alone does not serve to normalize the Klan. ” A&E also announced partnerships with the   League and Color of Change, and it said both civil rights organizations would produce viewer guides and an educational curriculum to go along with the series, as well as participate in a   special.  “We feel that this new title and enhanced partnerships, the   and   components and our outreach plan more broadly reflect the existing   content of the series and our longstanding intention,” A&E Executive Vice President Rob Sharenow said in a statement about the updated elements of the series. “That goal is to expose and combat racism and hatred in all its forms and we appreciate the valuable feedback we have received. ” The series was produced by This is Just a Test, a Los   production company behind shows such as TLC’s “I Am Jazz,” about a transgender teen; Animal Planet’s “Project Grizzly,” which features a bear trainer; and History’s “Big Rig Bounty Hunters,” about people who search for missing truck cargo. Though the trailer for “Escaping the KKK” was removed from YouTube, the New York Times described an introductory scene in the series in which a KKK member gifts his young daughters KKK hoods. The story noted that the series, which was ordered about a year and a half ago, caused some “ ” in the A&E executive ranks. “We certainly didn’t want the show to be seen as a platform for the views of the KKK,” Sharenow told the Times. “The only political agenda is that we really do stand against hate. ”"

","     If there was a theme to the Christmas Eve games, as NFL teams battled for playoff spots and some sort of momentum with the playoffs two weeks away, it was an awful one. Completing the terrible trifecta of “legs aren’t supposed to bend that way” injuries, Tyler Lockett of the Seattle Seahawks joined Marcus Mariota and Derek Carr.  Lockett was headed for surgery after his right leg became pinned beneath Brandon Williams of the Arizona Cardinals as the two fell to the turf on Lockett’s touchdown reception. As quarterback Russell Wilson celebrated the   score, he ran toward the end zone and quickly discovered that Lockett was hurt. “ . . . I got close to him,” Wilson said, “and there was blood everywhere near his ankle. So that was an ugly situation. You just pray for him. ”   Tyler Lockett #injury. Hell of a player, get well soon! #Seahawks pic. twitter.   —   newt205 (@newt205) December 24, 2016   Lockett, the team’s No. 2 wide receiver, is expected to have surgery and is out for the rest of the season, according to Coach Pete Carroll, declining to say exactly what the injury is. “All of us were heartbroken for him over there, and he was consoling us,” said Doug Baldwin, one of the teammates who gathered around as Lockett’s leg was immobilized and he was carted off. “That speaks volumes about his faith and his resolve and the manner in which he goes about handling obstacles. This is just another obstacle for him, and I have no doubt that he’s going to come back from this stronger, both physically, mentally and spiritually. ” For the Seahawks, it was an especially sobering reminder of their mortality. Although they have won the NFC West at    they are hardly the menacing opponent that went to consecutive Super Bowls in 2014 and 2015. And, to boot, they’re likely to have to face the task of winning two games on the road.    Russell Wilson offers a kind word as Tyler Lockett is carted off. (Ted S.  )  Lockett was the third player to go down with a leg injury Saturday. Mariota, whose Tennessee Titans have been eliminated from the playoffs, and Carr, touted as an MVP candidate for the Oakland Raiders, both went down with broken fibulas. Mariota’s season already was over; Carr’s is now, but he tweeted Saturday evening that he is “not worried one bit. ”  The same can’t be said for Raiders and Seahawks fans.   Thank you!

I’ve only seen pictures on Twitter. ”  “Every year you’ve got to do a little something different,” Flacco said. “It’s actually a lot of pressure,” he added with a laugh. It was all smiles for the New York Giants, too, after star defensive end Olivier Vernon reportedly bought his entire team bottles of cognac worth more than most people’s monthly salary.

Per Remy Martin cellar master Pierrette Trichet, who spoke to the Wall Street Journal in 2011, first you hold the glass at an arm’s length to get your first whiff of the “flowery scents” of the aroma. Then you breathe it in closer, where you’ll discover “some prune, some fig and also some nutty flavors, like hazelnut. ” Lastly, you sip to “get a fireworks of flavors. ” According to NJ. com’s Dan Duggan, it’s likely Vernon spent over $300, 000 to supply the 75 teammates, as well as 20 coaches and various other staff. Perhaps no one’s gifts were more extravagant than what Dallas Cowboys running back Ezekiel Elliot gave his   though. The rookie dropped an estimated $16, 000 on each for a fleet of John Deere 855D S4 model utility terrain vehicles, which he doled out on Friday.

142469,217951,This man is on a mission to fix the way we sleep,Washington Post,Hayley Tsukayama,2016-12-23,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161226000056/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2016/12/23/this-man-is-on-a-mission-to-fix-the-way-we-sleep/
","     James Proud is a man on a mission to fix our sleep.  This   recipient of Peter Thiel’s ”     ” fellowship is convinced that building gadgets for the home is the best way to improve our lives through tech. And improving sleep, he’s sure, is the place to start. His company, Hello, makes the Sense, a glowing orb that pairs with a clip that you attach to your pillow and connects with a phone app. The system monitors the conditions in your bedroom and charts them so that, over time, you get a better handle on what helps you improve your sleep. Proud’s sleep tracker is one of the latest devices to tackle what the Centers for Disease Control has declared a ”public health problem”: insufficient sleep. Others have gotten into the act, including Fitbit, Apple and its ”bedtime” feature, and many other apps. The desire for us to get better sleep is so great that sleep tech even has its own section at the tech industry’s CES trade show this year, for the first time in the show’s   history. But Proud envisions something different for Hello. “When looking at all of the wearables, we saw that people were fascinated with their sleep. But for all of these wearable devices, it was tacked on,” he said. “So we said, let’s focus on that foundation. We have to go further than what you would do with a wearable device, and find out what’s going on in the room. ” Sense gives you more information than just the number of hours you spend in bed. Besides tracking your room’s conditions, the orb half of the system doubles as a white noise machine and glowing alarm clock. The latest model can even take voice commands that will let you control the smart lights in your bedroom or lower the thermostat.    The clip on your pillow and orb on your nightstand help you monitor your sleep. (Courtesy of Hello)  I decided to try out Proud’s tracker, with the hopes of finally waving goodbye to the bags under my eyes. It’s been working for me, to varying degrees. I’ve used sleeping apps before, which require you to have your smartphone on or near your bed as you sleep    directly contradicting the conventional wisdom that you shouldn’t have screens in bed. With Sense, I like that I can set up my alarms and white noise from the app on my phone before I sleep, and then leave my phone outside the bedroom. Plus, having a sensor clipped to my pillow means I don’t have to wear a wristband or headband to bed, which keeps   from being uncomfortable. Sense also helped me figure out the temperature that helps me drift off in peace. Our bedroom was always a little too hot. But Sense explained that opening my windows wasn’t helping because it raised the room’s humidity and worsened its air quality. Through trial and error, I found that switching on a fan in the room at least a half hour before I hit the hay is a better alternative. The sensor doesn’t always pick up everything accurately, however, though it has improved over time     possibly in part because Sense lets you correct data you think is wrong. Still, just seeing the information about my bedtime habits helped me change for the better.  For example, I didn’t realize how often I was lying awake in bed    or lingering in the morning    until I started looking at the Sense data. While I thought I was only loitering in bed a day or two a week, it was actually much more of a habit than I thought it was. Similarly, I often thought I was only cheating on my unofficial bedtime a night or two a week, but it was four nights a week, aka, most days. Now I’ve moved my target for bedtime back a   and the overall quality of my sleep has gone up. I also found I went to bed later on Sundays, which always made Monday morning hit me like a ton of bricks.    I traveled a lot in October. (Screengrabs by Hayley Tsukayama)  Other changes have been a little more subtle. Sense tells you, for example, when you move around a lot in your sleep. Armed with that information, I started trying to figure out what made me restless, and managed to draw some conclusions by observing my own behavior. Eating too close to bedtime makes me more restless, as does not giving myself at least a   to spin down from the day. Sense tries to help make those finer conclusions as well, for example, suggesting about what time I should stop drinking caffeine at night. Sense also provides what it calls a relative metric    telling individuals how they rank among their peers    to encourage people to change their habits, said Matt Walker, a sleep researcher and Hello’s chief science officer. I personally didn’t find knowing, for example, that I woke up at a more consistent time than 68 percent of other people that motivating. But Walker said that telling users how they’re sleeping as compared with other (anonymized) users is the best way to change habits. Maybe if I were less consistent than 68 percent of people, I would feel differently. Of the Internet of Things things I’ve tried to fold into my daily life so far, Sense has done the best job of convincing me of its worth. It hasn’t completely fixed my sleep, and I won’t credit Sense alone for changing my habits. It provides good information, but, like every other sleep tracker I’ve tried, I had to act on the information for myself    even with Sense’s little nudges.

","      I’ve been in my room at the Hollander in Chicago about three minutes when I realize I’m not alone. An exaggerated sniffling noise comes from the top bunk, just over my left shoulder, startling me.  The fact that there’s someone in my room isn’t as alarming as it might seem. It’s a newly opened   hybrid, and I’ve booked a night in a women’s room with six bunks. I thought I was poking around unobserved  —   turning on the individual lamps by each of the bunks and preparing to snap a photo of the lofty shared space  —   when she announces her presence. “Oh, I’m sorry!” I say, “I didn’t know anyone was in here!” She doesn’t respond. She doesn’t even look at me. Slightly rattled, I head to the lobby to get a cup of coffee and consider the irony of her silence. The shared rooms at this swanky new lodging are promoted on the website as a “social stay. ” That applies to social media interactions; guests are given an opportunity to share their Instagram handle when booking the room to see with whom they’re staying, although there were none posted the night I’m there. It also implies “social” in the more traditional sense  —   interacting in the room you’re sharing with others and in the common areas, such as the lobby, combo bar and cafe, and laundry. Whether the social experiment works or not, there’s something else at play at the Hollander that I find far more intriguing. Its interiors, designed by a French firm, feel more boutique hotel than hostel, with wraparound booths,   woven chairs, walls and paint peeling just enough to look intentionally industrial chic. The bar serves coffee, craft beers and bottled cocktails; a bike shop is in the works, and a rooftop pool and bar with restaurant will open in the spring. In addition to the eight   rooms with en suite bathrooms, where beds start at $25 a night, there are 12 private rooms that sleep three to four and start at $105 a night. Social or    one thing is clear: This isn’t your hippie backpacking hostel.    The common area at the Hollander aims to encourage social interaction. Chairs are grouped around tables, and coffee, beer, cocktails and snacks are available at the   cafe. Movie nights and a bike shop are planned. (Adrian   Habita)     A hotel and vacation rental alternative “Poshtel” is the cutesy name occasionally given to places like the Hollander, and according to Feargal Mooney, chief executive of Hostelworld Group, an online platform for booking rooms in 33, 000 hostels around the world, the upscale appeal is becoming widespread throughout the hostel industry. “The majority of hostels now are   products,” Mooney says. “They’re offering a combination of private rooms and shared rooms, they’re offering restaurants and bars, they’re offering free WiFi, they’re offering   reception desk and security. So that is the norm in the industry now. ” While renting a bed in a shared room with strangers may not appeal to everyone, a hostel’s private room option presents an enticing and affordable hotel alternative. According to “Global Hostel Marketplace ” a report commissioned by Hostelworld and conducted by Phocuswright, a travel industry research firm, 9 out of 10 hostels have private rooms. I’d happily book a private room with my husband in a hostel for a more local,    overnight. And if traveling with a group, filling one of the shared rooms with three or five friends would be a blast  —   an inexpensive one, at that. The Hollander, in particular, has an awesome location in Chicago, surrounded by restaurants, bars and music venues of Bucktown and Wicker Park, about three miles from downtown, where most hotels are.    Private rooms with en suite bathrooms start at $105 a night and sleep three to four people at the Hollander.

(Urban House)    The United States has long lagged behind much of the world when it comes to hostels, Mooney says. The United States and Canada are home to just 3 percent of hostel properties, accounting for 10 percent of global hostel revenue, according to the report. Compare that to hotels, where the United States draws 28 percent of global revenue. There’s significant room for U. S. growth in the $5. 2 billion hostel industry.  To capture a piece of that pie, the Hollander and other properties are dangling    hipster magnets, like, well, avocado toast. About four miles northeast of the Hollander, in the tony River North neighborhood, is the Freehand hotel. Here, amid the private and shared rooms, the   restaurant, Café Integral, serves $9 avocado toast. The bar, Broken Shaker, whips up a Cracker Jack Old Fashioned  —   “popcorn washed mellow corn and Old Forester whiskies stirred with salted molasses and ballpark peanut bitters” —   all in a sophisticated setting designed by the New York firm Roman and Williams. Freehand also has a location in Miami and will open one in Los Angeles in February and in New York in fall 2017. The Wayfarer Hotel in Santa Barbara, Calif. which opened its downtown doors in 2014 with 27 private rooms and four shared rooms, hosts regular social events including pool parties, pub crawls, cooking demonstrations and live music nights. It also has a heated outdoor pool, free breakfast and WiFi, and bike rentals. And Generator, a beloved European outfit that bills itself as “  hostels,” is opening its first U.

(The Wayfarer)     Shared economy meets experience economy Mehmet Erdem, an associate professor of hotel operations and technology at the William F. Harrah College of Hotel Administration at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, says that the appeal of modern hostels touches on a couple of buzzwords that resonate with younger generations: “sharing economy” (you’re sharing a room, after all) and the “experience economy. ” Why sleep in a boring, beige   hotel room when you can book a bed or a room in a funky, renovated warehouse? “The focus is more on creating memories. . . . There’s an underlying element of luxury, but it’s not so much on the forefront. And the emphasis is on the experience,” Erdem says. “They want to experience something unique so they can get back on Facebook and share it with their friends. ” Mooney of Hostelworld is quick to point out that it’s not just the bells and whistles that are helping hostels fill rooms. It’s also that social aspect that the Hollander is going after  —   something that’s especially appealing to young travelers (70 percent of hostel guests are millennials, according to the report) and solo travelers, which make up 72 percent of hostel guests in the United States.  “What they’ve got that’s different from a boutique hotel is a very vibrant social experience, and they’ll all have a common area where customers would go to interact and engage with other international travelers. That’s really what makes hostels different than a hotel or any other form of budget accommodation,” Mooney says. And that’s something that will need to take place organically in due time, judging from my experience at the Hollander. I think back to my phone interview a week earlier with Carlos Couturier. Couturier is   of Grupo Habita, the   hotel developer that operates the Hollander. He was lamenting the fact that the younger generation seems to have forgotten how to talk to one another. They walk around with headphones on, he said, and stare at their phones. “We’ve lost our patience to interact and connect and we have to do something about that,” he says. “So this is how we’re trying to do it through hospitality. ” While I don’t have any other interactions with guests (at 5 o’clock on a Friday evening, two men and one woman sit strategically far from one another in the lobby, staring at their laptops) I chat with the warm staff at the front desk and the bar, and get an excellent recommendation for dinner that night. Later, when I return to my room at about 10 p. m. the lights are off and the sniffler in the top bunk is asleep. I climb to my own top bunk as quietly as I can and try to doze. Around midnight, another woman enters the room and crawls into a bottom bunk. In the dark, I can hear occasional snores, coos and stretching sounds coming from the other bunks  —   intimate sounds, now laid bare for strangers. The latecomer’s alarm goes off at 6 a. m. She pushes snooze, and it goes off again at 6:10. She shows no sign of getting up, and I harbor no hope of falling back asleep, so I use the flashlight app on my phone to gather my items and tiptoe out. The social part of me  —   were it to be called upon, after all  —   doesn’t really do mornings.  Silver is a writer based in Chicago.

142472,217954,"My answer to the holiday sugar glut: Pomegranates, and lots of them",Washington Post,Casey Seidenberg,2016-12-20,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161226000056/https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/wellness/my-answer-to-the-holiday-sugar-glut-pomegranates-and-lots-of-them/2016/12/19/aa5d01ae-c167-11e6-8422-eac61c0ef74d_story.html
"," Candy and sugar have once again invaded our world. It began innocently enough with a gingerbread house, then lingered with the    sprinkle cookies from friends, then endured with the classroom holiday parties, the candy canes that garnish every wrapped present, and the hot chocolate with marshmallows that lures my kids on these cold days. I would like to be the Grinch and shove it all up the chimney. I fear that if they keep up this pace, my children might spiral and sputter by the time Christmas arrives. Yet I have decided not to hijack all of the season’s treats. Instead, I will help my kids pick the ones they really want and then fill their bellies with as many vitamins and antioxidants as I can from now until the new year. My hope is that these nutrients will counteract some of sugar’s negative effects. Antioxidants prevent oxidative damage caused by sugar, magnesium regulates blood sugar and insulin spikes, and vitamin C boosts my children’s immune systems. Not a perfect solution, but perhaps better than waging war against holiday treats.  To ensure my children consume these powerful vitamins and antioxidants, I will be feeding them as many fruits and vegetables as I can. Pomegranate seeds will act as Rudolph’s nose and lead the way. My    daughter is attracted to anything bright and sparkly, so it is no wonder she is obsessed with these little neon seeds. She dumps them on every bowl of oatmeal, every serving of yogurt and in every cup of fizzy water. Can these   seeds do any   good? Absolutely. Pomegranate seeds have been shown to fight cancer, improve memory, reduce inflammation, lower blood pressure and reduce heart disease. It is no wonder they were portrayed as a healing fruit in the Bible. One   of pomegranate seeds provides   grams of fiber, more than twice the amount found in the same size serving of apples. This fiber slows the natural sugar of the pomegranate as it enters the body’s bloodstream, preventing a sugar rush. The fruit’s B vitamins create sustained energy. The potassium helps to regulate blood pressure and support nerve function. The antioxidants, such as tannins, quercetin and anthocyanins, are all   and  . The vitamin K, folate and iron keep the blood healthy. Lastly, vitamins C and E, powerful antioxidants, boost the immune system and keep tissues from being damaged by pollutants, toxins and sugars. These festive fruits are ripe from September through January, so ’tis the season for them. They can be stored for up to two weeks at room temperature or for up to three months in the refrigerator. Each pomegranate houses about 600 seeds. So have at it, gingerbread men: The pomegranate is here to save our holiday. It is much more fun to be the festive mom doling out gleaming red seeds than to be the grumpy, grudging Grinch this season. How to enjoy pomegranate seeds • Snack straight from the fruit. • Top a bowl of oatmeal. • Mix into waffles. • Stir into yogurt. • Toss over salads. • Add to bean or   dishes. • Sprinkle onto a soup such as squash or lentil. • Pomegranate “mocktail”: Mix pomegranate juice and sparkling water, then finish with a few pomegranate seeds. How to   a pomegranate 1. Cut a quarter inch off each end so the fruit stands flat. 2. Using a pairing knife, cut out the center, trying not to puncture the seeds. 3. Make six slices into the fruit and skin to loosen it, then pry it apart with your hands. 4. Section by section, pry the seeds from the skin. This works best in a bowl of water so the seeds sink to the bottom and the skin rises to the top.    More from Lifestyle:     dishes to spice up your Valentine’s Day   Ramadan in Iraq is so sweet.

142473,217961,President Obama says he could have beaten Trump — Trump says ‘NO WAY!’,Washington Post,Michael Kranish,2016-12-26,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161227003658/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/12/26/president-obama-says-he-would-have-beaten-trump-if-i-had-run-again/
","     President Obama said in an interview released Monday that he could have beaten Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump “if I had run again. ” In his most pointed critique yet, Obama said Hillary Clinton’s campaign acted too cautiously out of a mistaken belief that victory was all but certain. “If you think you’re winning, then you have a tendency, just like in sports, maybe to play it safer,” Obama said in the interview with former adviser and longtime friend David Axelrod, a CNN analyst, for his “The Axe Files” podcast. The president said Clinton “understandably . . . looked and said, well, given my opponent and the things he’s saying and what he’s doing, we should focus on that. ” Trump took exception to this critique, tweeting out later in the day that “President Obama said that he thinks he would have won against me. He should say that but I say NO WAY!  —    jobs leaving, ISIS, OCare, etc. ”   President Obama said that he thinks he would have won against me. He should say that but I say NO WAY!   jobs leaving, ISIS, OCare, etc.  —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 26, 2016   Obama stressed his admiration for Clinton and said she had been the victim of unfair attacks. But, as he has in other exit interviews, Obama insisted that her defeat was not a rejection of the eight years of his presidency. To the contrary, he argued that he had put together a winning coalition that stretched across the country but that the Democratic Party and the Clinton campaign had failed to follow through on it. “I am confident in this vision because I’m confident that if I  —   if I had run again and articulated it  —   I think I could’ve mobilized a majority of the American people to rally behind it,” the president said. “See, I think the issue was less that Democrats have somehow abandoned the white working class, I think that’s nonsense,” Obama said. “Look, the Affordable Care Act benefits a huge number of Trump voters. There are a lot of folks in places like West Virginia or Kentucky who didn’t vote for Hillary, didn’t vote for me, but are being helped by this . . . The problem is, is that we’re not there on the ground communicating not only the dry policy aspects of this, but that we care about these communities, that we’re bleeding for these communities. ”              Caption   Eight years after he burst onto the scene with a youthful vigor, his   hair has gone nearly fully gray.

142474,217962,Four Cabinet nominations that could blow up in Donald Trump’s face,Washington Post,Amber Phillips,2016-12-26,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161227003658/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/12/26/four-cabinet-nominations-that-could-blow-up-in-donald-trumps-face/
","     With a    Senate majority next month, Republicans will have power in numbers. But a handful of   GOP senators could arguably have even more power. Just three Republicans could derail some of Donald Trump’s critical   nominations, which need to be approved by a   majority of the U. S. Senate. (After Senate Democrats got rid of the filibuster in 2013 for nominations like these, they essentially took away their ability to block Trump’s nominations, because a filibuster would have essentially translated into a   confirmation requirement.) History suggests it’s very rare for senators from the president’s own party to block his Cabinet appointments. But it is a possibility for several of Trump’s picks. Here are four of Trump’s nominations that could draw support from most Republicans  —   but resistance from a critical few: Rex Tillerson: Secretary of state        Donald Trump has picked Rex Tillerson as his nominee for secretary of state. Here’s what you need to know about Tillerson. (Thomas   Washington Post)   The background: The ExxonMobil chief executive was an unorthodox pick for the nation’s top diplomatic job, one that The Washington Post reported came at the last minute via an offhand recommendation from a pair of   former Bush administration officials (whose firm happens to work with ExxonMobil.) Why it could blow up: Tillerson has extensive business ties to Russia and, specifically, to President Vladimir Putin. The two worked together to seal energy and drilling deals in the face of U. S. sanctions against Russia, and Tillerson even accepted an award from Moscow. German newspaper Suddeutsche Zeitung reported that Tillerson also ran a U. S.  oil firm in the Bahamas, a tax haven (and reminiscent of the offshoring Trump has said he wants to crack down on.) Watchdogs say it’s problematic for any secretary of state to have such close financial and personal ties to any country, but the fact that it’s Russia only heightens bipartisan concern in Washington that Trump is too friendly toward a nation that a decisive majority of U. S. political and intelligence leaders believe is more of a foe. Whom to watch: Being tight with Putin is a red line for some   Senate Republicans, including Marco Rubio (Fla.) Jeff Flake (Ariz.) and Rand Paul (Ky. ).They sit on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, which will vote first on Tillerson. If just one or two vote against the nomination, that would swing the panel against the nod.

Rubio, Rand, Flake all on SFRC and it’s a     split. He gets rejected in committee, that’s it. https:  .   —   Paul Kane (@pkcapitol) December 11, 2016   Jeff Sessions: Attorney general        Donald Trump announced Friday that he plans to nominate Sen. Jeff Sessions ( .) as attorney general. (Thomas   Washington Post)   The background: Trump awarded one of his earliest Capitol Hill supporters with the nation’s top law enforcement job. Sessions  —   a     politician  —   has been in the Senate for two decades, after a stint as a U. S. attorney for Alabama. Why his confirmation could blow up: There’s precedent. In 1986, Ronald Reagan’s administration nominated Sessions to serve as a federal judge, but his nomination ran into trouble when former colleagues accused Sessions of saying racially insensitive things, such as warning a black colleague to be careful about what he said ”to white folks.” ”I am not a racist,” Session declared at the time. But the damage was done: The   Senate panel voted 10 to 8 to block his nomination. At the time, Sessions was only the second nominee in 50 years the Senate denied for a federal judgeship. Here, too, a nominee’s Achilles’ heel threatens to make Trump himself more vulnerable; this time, it’s criticism that the   has ties to or is at least agreeable to the   community. Whom to watch: No Republican on the panel that will hold hearings on Sessions’s nomination has expressed concern about Sessions (senatorial courtesy tends to come into play in these sorts of situations.) And if all Republicans hold together, a unified Democratic caucus wouldn’t be able to stop Sessions. But as Sessions learned all too well 30 years ago, events can change suddenly. Keep an eye on Sen. Chuck Grassley ( ) chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, for indication of any potential Republican mood swings. Sessions appears to understand how quickly things can turn. Politico reports he’s trying to do damage control from that hearing 30 years ago: ”[T]he senator, in a lengthy nominee questionnaire delivered this month, practically depicts himself as a civil rights hero.” Steven Mnuchin: Treasury secretary      Banker Steven Mnuchin is the next potential Treasury Secretary in Donald Trump’s administration. Here’s what you need to know about him. (Deirdra O’  Washington Post)   The background: Like Trump, the former Goldman Sachs executive and finance director of Trump’s campaign has no former experience in government. Since leaving Wall Street, Mnuchin (pronounced   ) has been a   backer of some Hollywood extravaganzas, including ”Suicide Squad.” Why his confirmation hearing could blow up: Wall Street. Specifically, his investment in a bank, then called IndyMac, that foreclosed on about 36, 000 California homeowners during the housing crisis (despite receiving about $900 million in federal bailout money) and that has been accused of discrimination. If Democrats want to make an example out of anyone in Trump’s wealthy, Wall   Cabinet lineup, Mnuchin’s nomination could be the best option. After all, his job would be to manage the nation’s finances in part by overseeing Wall Street. Who to watch: So far, the Republicans we’ve heard talk about Mnuchin  —   notably, Sen. Orrin Hatch (Utah) the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, which will review his nomination  —   have praised him. But if Sens. Elizabeth Warren ( .) Bernie Sanders ( .) and Jeff Merkley ( .) have their way, the GOP will be put on defense about Mnuchin’s background. They have set up a website encouraging California residents to ”share their personal stories of being impacted by the ’Foreclosure King’ Steve Mnuchin,” and it’s a safe bet that Democrats will be reading some of those stories at Mnuchin’s hearing. Interestingly, the Republican Party’s official biography for Mnuchin  —   which noted his Tinseltown success, listing highlights of the successful   lineup from ”  Entertainment”  —   left out most of his Wall Street ties, including any mention of his top perch at Goldman Sachs. James Mattis: Defense secretary      Retired U. S. Marine Corps General James Mattis has been chosen to be secretary of defense by   Donald Trump, according to people familiar with the decision. (Jenny   Washington Post)   The background: In the Marines, retired Gen. James Mattis is a legend. His gritty,     style earned him the battlefield nickname ”Mad Dog,” a high compliment in Marine culture and one that Trump apparently appreciates.   General James ”Mad Dog” Mattis, who is being considered for Secretary of Defense, was very impressive yesterday. A true General’s General!  —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 20, 2016   How the confirmation hearing could blow up: Well, it’s not even legal right now for Mattis to take the job. Congress has a    law that defense secretaries can’t have been on active duty in the previous seven years, a somewhat symbolic reminder from our government that the military serves to help civilians. Mattis retired in 2013. That means both chambers of Congress must pass a law allowing a waiver for Mattis, then he has to be confirmed by the Senate. Whom to watch: So far, Mattis has received praise from key GOP Senate leaders, including John McCain (Ariz.) the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, which will review Mattis’s nomination. But there is scattered opposition. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand ( . Y.) said she’d oppose a waiver for Mattis on principle: ”Civilian control of our military is a fundamental principle of American democracy, and I will not vote for an exception to this rule.” For now, it seems as if Gillibrand is in the minority on the Hill (in more ways than one.) But relying on Congress for any special favor is far from a   plan."

","      It was here, in this midsize college town in the dead center of Tennessee, that a   effort to ban Islamic law found one of its first sponsors. Here, too, a congressman   a plan to “defund Muslim ‘refugees’ ” and local residents sued to block construction of the only mosque, a fight that ended at the Supreme Court. The town’s Muslims carried on through all of that, raising their children, saying their prayers, teaching at college, filling people’s prescriptions and filling their tanks, contributing to the civic life in a city of 126, 000. They felt the familiar grief and fear of reprisal last year when a Muslim man killed four Marines in Chattanooga, 90 minutes away. Now Donald Trump  —   a man who has repeatedly cast doubt on the patriotism of Muslims  —   is the   and he has selected a national security adviser, retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, who has called Islam a “cancer. ” And a deep unease has again seeped into the daily life of many here in this Muslim community of about 1, 500. There has been a smattering of   harassment and insults  —   at schools, in parking lots, on the road  —   but nothing to take to the police or put Murfreesboro back in the national headlines. “Right now, we’re hoping that it’s going to be calm,” said Saleh Sbenaty, an engineering professor at Middle Tennessee State University and one of the founders of the Islamic Center of Murfreesboro. “But we don’t know if it’s the calm before the storm or the calm after the storm. ”      (McKenna Ewen, Whitney Leaming, Alice   Washington Post)   A ‘melting pot,’ or the‘buckle on the Bible Belt’ Murfreesboro is one of the   cities in the country and an increasingly diverse one. Muslim and Christian students go to school and play sports together; their families patronize the same restaurants and stores. Residents variously describe the town as a proud example of Southern hospitality, a growing “melting pot,” a suburb of “little blue dot” Nashville and the “buckle on the Bible Belt. ” Its downtown with the old courthouse and   memorial yields to strip malls and chain stores, new housing developments and old cotton fields, and the university, with its 20, 000 undergraduates. You can drive to the popular shawarma joint for some Arab cuisine, then get back in the car and hear syndicated   host Michael Savage on the radio wondering how many veterans are in jail “for having the guts to kill an  . ” Among the town’s couple hundred places of worship are 59 Baptist churches, including an Arabic Baptist church as well as Grace Baptist, whose deacon in 2010 greeted the construction of the new mosque next door by erecting 23 huge white crosses on the road. There are people such as Abdou Kattih, a pharmacist at Walgreens and one of the mosque’s founders, and Jason Bennett, an evangelical advocate for the homeless and a onetime mosque opponent; the two now consider each other close friends.    From left, Annan Chamdin, Brian Mumpower, Hiba Kattih and Stephanie Mumpower chat while preparing meals for the Murfreesboro Muslim Youth group’s Thanksgiving Day event. (Michael Noble Jr. for The Washington Post)  There are people such as the   “  Southern Baptist,” shopping at Bullseye Gun, Gear and Pawn on a recent day, who is certain that Muslims think they have the right “to kill you and take your wife as a sex slave. ” The man declined to give his name, he said, because he employs a number of Muslims in his   company anyway and did not want them to know what he thinks. He still goes to cookouts and ballgames with them, he said.  On the other hand, said James McCarroll Jr. a pastor at First Baptist Church, “we’re seeing more of an acceptance, a lot of it being spurred by the university having a large community of Muslims. ” The day after the election, flowers were left on the mosque’s doorstep, and a stranger approached the new imam, an Egyptian, at the Walmart and welcomed him to town. Nothing seems to illustrate the complicated attitudes better than Tammy and Ahmed Ragab’s family  —   three conservative Muslims and three evangelical Christians sharing a house. The couple bought a home with Tammy’s parents five years ago. To the Ragabs, Trump is a threat personified. They see him as a man whose policies and rhetoric have emboldened people to attack and vilify Muslims, including their    daughter, who they said was threatened at school the week after the election. Tammy’s parents and sister voted for him. In five years of diverging viewpoints and lifestyles  —   the couples cook separately, watch different news channels and celebrate different holidays  —   a simple harmony has prevailed, they said, because they love each other. Tammy’s parents eat pork, go to church and keep “a whole cabinet of Jesus statues” in the house, Tammy said. They also remind their granddaughter to pray five times a day and help her pick out clothes to match her hijab. “But at the same time, when it comes to the Trump issues, she’ll say, ‘Oh, he only said that one time,’ ” Tammy said of her mother. “They don’t believe he’s going to do the things he said. ” Tammy, who converted to Islam a few years before meeting Ahmed, an Egyptian immigrant, implores her mother to consider “the things we might face” under Trump. “And she says, ‘Well, that’s your choice.’ ” Her mother, Linda Harmon, said she knows “a lot of people are scared that Muslims are going to have to register and get shipped back. ” But, she added, “even a lot of Muslims want people vetted. . . . He’s not going to send any back that aren’t causing any trouble, I don’t think. ” ‘I didn’t know youwere one of them’ Kattih, the pharmacist, remembers a day a few years back when a customer came in to fill a prescription and said, “Did you hear those damn Muslims want to build a church in town?” Kattih, who immigrated as an adult from Syria, told her that he is a Muslim. His skin, like many of the Arab immigrants in the town, is just as pale as the whites who can trace their American lineage back generations. The exchange resulted in a moment of shock, a hurried exit and, a week later, an apology. “I didn’t know you were one of them,” he remembered her saying the next time she came in. “I just wanted to apologize. If you need anything, call me. ” The incident shaped his outlook, he said: Maybe people just don’t know enough about each other.    Abdou Kattih, a   of the Islamic Center of Murfreesboro and president of Murfreesboro Muslim Youth. (Michael Noble Jr. for The Washington Post)  Last year, Kattih founded Murfreesboro Muslim Youth, a community service group that aims to make Muslims visible and familiar to people who would not dare visit the mosque. “What people in America are failing to realize: Most immigrant Muslims lived under dictatorship. Fear is embedded in their skin. So when they’re afraid, they retract,” Kattih said. “And I think that’s the opposite of what needs to happen. You need to stretch out your hand to allies. And you’ll be surprised what hands reach out back. ” A week after the election, the group’s members, most in their late teens or early 20s, gathered in the town square and handed out flowers to strangers. Some people from other faiths joined in. On Thanksgiving, the students cooked 48 meals and gave them to families in need. When students hosted a    event on the university campus earlier this year, “most people came up to us and said they had never met a Muslim,” said Basant Salem, 18, who moved to Murfreesboro five years ago from Morgantown, W. Va. when her father became a genetics professor at the university. “We don’t have to change their views,” said Basant’s sister, Samar, 21, who once brought cookies to mosque protesters, “but just make them aware that we aren’t what they think we are. ” ‘I think we’re going to see some pretty rough times’ What worries and perplexes many Muslims and their friends here is what lies beneath the surface. What impact will Trump have as president when distrust of Muslims already exists? Bennett, director of the Murfreesboro Cold Patrol   group, used to belong to an evangelical church opposed to the mosque, which protesters and politicians accused of supporting terrorism. Vandals struck the building site three times, at one point setting construction equipment on fire. Bennett changed his thinking after he met Kattih and other Muslims also involved in providing social services to those in need. He said the fear and the false pronouncements  —   that Muslims worship a different God, are taught to lie or use mosques as militant training centers  —   are as pervasive in the town’s Sunday sermons and Bible studies as they were five years ago. “All that stuff is still there,” Bennett said. “When policies start to take effect after January, or start to move, I think we’re going to see some pretty rough times again. ” McCarroll, who leads a predominantly black church in Murfreesboro, echoed that concern. “I think we could see people displaced,” he said. “Right now it’s just rhetoric, but I think the town is really holding its breath. ” Ask locals about the churches that oppose Islam and many point first to the World Outreach Church, the largest megachurch in town. “We have a duty to investigate anyone under the banner of Islam,” the pastor, Allen Jackson, declared at a hearing on the mosque plan in 2010. The church declined to comment on Jackson’s view now, but a man who worships there said the pastor continues to view Islam through a prism of holy war: “He thinks it’s biblical. ”   Men and women who once sued and protested against the mosque come in to fill prescriptions from Kattih, buy doughnuts or cigarettes from Essam Mohammed at the Quik Mart or attend one of Sbenaty’s engineering classes. They trade pleasantries. They’re polite. They continue on their way.    A man works on his truck in Murfreesboro. (Michael Noble Jr. for The Washington Post)  Howard Wall puts it like this: “If I have to go the store to get a Coke or something, we talk. I’m nice to them, they’re nice to me. ” Wall and his wife, Sally, are local developers who were among those who sued to stop the mosque construction, litigation that was resolved when the U. S. Supreme Court declined to take up the case. The couple have no plans to take up another fight. They also think it won’t be necessary, because Trump will limit the arrival of more Muslims. Murfreesboro doesn’t need “to have a lot of Muslims,” Sally Wall said. “I think they can stay where they are and we stay where we are. ” But there’s more tolerance because of the public acrimony over the mosque, said City Council member Bill Shacklett.  “I wish some of the things hadn’t happened. But the one thing it has done is compel people to open their hearts and minds to be drawn toward each other . . . get out and flesh out your faith with different people,” Shacklett said, adding that Muslims and Christians have started to do that. “Maybe that wouldn’t have happened if we hadn’t had the spotlight put on us for all of that. ” "

"," Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s historic visit to Pearl Harbor with President Obama on Tuesday punctuates the Obama administration’s multiyear effort to prod Japan and its neighbors in Asia to decrease tensions by moving beyond lingering wartime grievances. But as the two leaders pay homage to the 2, 403 Americans who died in the surprise Japanese attack on Dec. 7, 1941, the geopolitical backdrop for the event has been clouded by   Donald Trump’s pugnacious and unpredictable   pronouncements. During the campaign, Trump raised alarms in both countries when he questioned the value of the U. S. military’s basing agreements in Japan and suggested the island nation consider developing its own nuclear weapons. Abe is set to become the first Japanese leader to take part in a ceremony at the USS Arizona Memorial, which honors the American sailors and Marines who perished aboard the battleship 75 years ago. The trip, in the works before Trump’s election last month, is intended as a symbolic bookend to Obama’s visit in May to Hiroshima, where the United States deployed the world’s first atomic bomb. Like Obama, Abe does not plan to apologize for Japan’s sneak attack, which wounded an additional 1, 178 and prompted the United States’ entry into World War II. Rather, he will reflect on history “and renew the determination of the Japanese people not to repeat the devastation of war,” said Tamaki Tsukada, spokesman for the Japanese Embassy in Washington. U. S. military veterans are expected to take part in a ceremony that will be “a powerful demonstration of how the two countries can overcome a very painful history to become the closest of allies and friends,” Daniel Kritenbrink, the White House’s senior director for Asian affairs at the National Security Council, told reporters.   The USS Arizona Memorial, marking the resting place of the crewmen killed on December 7, 1941 when Japanese Naval Forces bombed Pearl Harbor, is pictured on December 24, 2016. (Jerome    Images)  Abe’s visit marks another delicate step toward broader regional reconciliation in Asia, though it is unlikely to satisfy demands in South Korea and China that the Japanese government formally apologize and atone for wartime atrocities. Three of Abe’s predecessors, including his grandfather, Nobusuke Kishi, a former prime minister, purportedly visited Pearl Harbor in the 1950s, but none took part in a ceremony to pay homage to the dead over concerns about   political opposition in Japan. Such a visit seemed unlikely as recently as three years ago, when Abe, leader of the conservative Liberal Democratic Party, visited Tokyo’s Yasukuni Shrine, the paean to Japan’s wartime dead, in a move that inflamed regional tensions and irritated the White House. The Obama administration has sought to improve relations in Asia, especially between U. S. allies Japan and South Korea, to hedge against China’s rise and address shared challenges, such as a   North Korea. Since then, Tokyo has negotiated, with support from the White House, a resolution with Seoul over the forced use of women as sex slaves by Japan’s imperial army. And Abe expressed remorse for the war during remarks to a joint meeting of the U. S. Congress last year ahead of the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II. Obama’s speech in Hiroshima, where he warned of the danger of nuclear weapons and urged disarmament, was well received in Japan, prompting Abe to pursue the reciprocal visit to Pearl Harbor. Obama is in Hawaii for his annual   winter vacation. Their visit “is a demonstration about how far the world has come in many instances,” said Hawaii Gov. David Ige (D) the son of a World War II veteran who in 2014 became the state’s second governor of Japanese ancestry. About   of Hawaii’s population is of Japanese ancestry, and Japan sent 1. 5 million tourists to the state last year, more than any other country. Abe, who arrived in Oahu on Monday, opened his visit with a   ceremony at the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific, a military cemetery known as Punchbowl. The prime minister is scheduled to have a formal bilateral meeting with Obama before visiting the USS Arizona Memorial. Ige said the relationship between the Japanese people and Hawaii “is more than business, more than friendship  —   it’s family. ” He called the U. S.  military alliance “the most important to keeping the peace in Asia. ” The question is what becomes of that alliance under Trump. Along with questioning U. S. basing agreements in Japan and South Korea, Trump suggested in March that the two U. S. allies are freeloading off the United States’ security umbrella. His suggestion that they consider developing their own nuclear weapons drew sharp rebukes from the Obama White House, which called the idea “catastrophic,” and national security experts in both political parties. Trump also has vowed to rip up the     Partnership trade deal negotiated by the Obama administration that includes Japan. Abe expended significant political capital to move the accord through the Japanese parliament over objections from protectionist domestic rice and automobile industries. Within days of Trump’s election, Abe rushed to begin building ties, becoming the first foreign leader to meet with the   during a stopover in New York in November en route to an   economic summit in Peru. “Trump’s campaign rhetoric is campaign rhetoric,” said Tsukada, the embassy spokesman. “We don’t believe the electorate or constituents take those message literally. In fact, you might have noticed that throughout the campaign, at one stage his rhetoric was extremely   with   type of language, but after a certain point it disappeared. By and large, we think he has a normal kind of balance. ” Some   analysts have speculated that Abe will seek to leverage the uncertainty around Trump’s agenda to speed his own   efforts to bolster the mission and capabilities of Japan’s   Forces. Abe played host this month to Russian President Vladi mir Putin, who visited the prime minister’s home town, in a bid to improve bilateral relations between their countries. That meeting, which had been in the works before Trump’s victory, caused consternation in Washington. Trump’s antagonistic posture toward China, including his unprecedented phone conversation with the president of Taiwan this month, also has unsettled the region. Analysts said Abe would welcome a shift of U. S. policy toward Taiwan, but they cautioned that China’s response to an escalation of tensions with the Trump administration could be aimed at Japan, as well. Tokyo is “relatively reassured that [Trump’s] campaign rhetoric of extreme isolationism is gone, but the unpredictability factor is still the biggest challenge,” said Sheila Smith, a Japan expert at the Council on Foreign Relations. “What Abe will want to do with Trump is to hug him close, and teach him about Japan and Asia. “I suspect they’re holding their breath a little bit,” Smith added. “But I do think in Mr. Abe’s personal visit and his subsequent   he’s trying to be the ally of choice for Mr. Trump. ”  Lyte reported from Hono lulu.

"," If Dec. 7, 1941, is the day that Franklin D. Roosevelt said “will live in infamy,” then Dec. 20, 2016, has got to be a close second. No Americans died that day as they did at Pearl Harbor, but the American Century, as Time magazine founder Henry Luce called it, came to a crashing end. Turkey, Iran and Russia met in Moscow to settle matters in the Middle East. The United States wasn’t even asked to the meeting.  Winston Churchill said in 1942 that he had not become Great Britain’s “First Minister in order to preside over the liquidation of the British Empire. ” Nonetheless, by the end of the 1940s, much of the empire was gone. Churchill was an unapologetic colonialist, but he was up against liberation movements of all kinds, not to mention the antipathy of the United States to imperialist ambitions  —   in short, history itself. Churchill had a marvelous way with words, and greatness accompanied him like a shadow, but in certain ways he was a   man wandering, confounded, in the 20th.  Barack Obama is quite the reverse. He is a   man who never quite appreciated the lessons of the 20th. He has been all too happy to preside over the loss of American influence. Aleppo, Syria, now a pile of rubble, is where countless died  —   as did American influence. The Russians polished it off from the air, doing for the Syrian regime what the United States could not figure out how to do for the rebels. The city hemorrhaged civilian dead, and America, once the preeminent power in the region, did virtually nothing.  It could be that Obama was right. It could be that all along he knew that the rebels were beyond saving  —   although he predicted that Bashar   would be toppled  —   and, anyway, the United States was not going to again get into some Middle Eastern quagmire. America had twice made war in Iraq; it had lost Marines in Lebanon. Though perhaps these were just excuses to do nothing. After all, no one ever recommended putting boots on the ground in Syria. That was Obama’s straw man.  “Time will tell” is the appropriate cliche. But I, along with others, thought the United States could have limited the bloodletting, that it could have established   zones where Syrian government helicopters could not have dropped barrel bombs. It could also have established safe zones for refugees. The Russians managed to do what they wanted to do. Why not the United States? The answer has always been clear to me  —   Obama did not care enough. Not from him ever came a thundering demand that Russia and Iran get out and stay out. Behind the arguably persuasive reasons to do little in Syria was an emotional coldness: This was not Obama’s fight.  Say what you will about Donald Trump, he cares. He cares about things I don’t, and he has some awful ideas, and he is an amoral man in so many ways. But, in contrast to Obama, his emotions are no mystery. When the Chinese fished a U. S. Navy drone from the Pacific Ocean, the White House reacted so coolly you would think freedom of the seas didn’t matter. Trump, however, tweeted his indignation, finally telling Beijing it could keep the drone  —   a way of telling them to stuff it. Hillary Clinton lost the election for a host of reasons, not the least of them her shortcomings as a candidate. And Trump won for many reasons, not the least of them his political talents. But Clinton had to defend an administration that was cold to the touch. Kellyanne Conway keeps pointing out that Clinton had no message. True. Neither, for that matter, did Obama. He waved a droopy flag. He did not want to make America great again. It was great enough for him already.  That coolness, that   Obama, cost lives in Syria. Instead of rallying the United States to a worthy cause  —   intervening to save lives and avoid a refugee crisis that is still destabilizing Europe  —   he threw in the towel. The banner he flew was one of American diminishment. One could agree. One could not be proud.  Since the end of World War II, American leadership has been essential to maintain world peace. Whether we liked it or not, we were the world’s policeman. There was no other cop on the beat. Now that leadership is gone. So, increasingly, will be peace.

"," Back in October, a   Research Poll found that   of Donald Trump voters didn’t trust   economic data, thanks partly to their candidate’s insistence that the numbers are bogus. Something tells me this attitude is about to change.  After all, Trump will soon take office with among the most favorable economic conditions  —   as measured by the government and private data sources  —   imaginable. And you can bet that he, and his supporters, will gleefully claim credit. Until things go south, anyway. For now,   economic data abound. The most recent jobs report shows the unemployment rate down to 4. 6 percent. It hasn’t been this low since August 2007, several months before the Great Recession began.  Or consider a broader measure of underemployment called the  . This includes workers who are   but want   work, and people who’ve given up looking for work but still want it. It’s not quite at its   level, but it has also fallen dramatically. Wages, too, have risen substantially. Adjusted for inflation, median weekly earnings for wage and salary workers were at an   high in the third quarter. Gas prices remain low, as does overall inflation. Meanwhile, stocks have reached   highs, with the Dow Jones industrial average on the cusp of 20, 000. Gross domestic product growth for the third quarter was revised upward last week, to 3. 5 percent. (Apparently Trump is even making the economy great again retroactively.)  Consumers likewise seem euphoric, with multiple measures of consumer confidence recently reaching   highs. These numbers are partly driven by a sharp spike in optimism among Republicans in the weeks since the election, but even before then confidence had been trending upward. All of which is to say: These are some brisk tail winds on which to sail into the Oval Office. They also represent economic conditions quite different from the catastrophic ones Barack Obama inherited in 2009.  Curiously, though, Trump’s priorities seem predicated on the premise that the U. S. economy is still circling the drain. He plans to usher through a major stimulus package early in his administration, including massive personal and corporate   cuts and a   $1 trillion infrastructure plan.  These measures are likely to further goose the economy, at least in the near term. You can bet, then, that early in his presidency, Trump will be touting all sorts of   economic data as evidence of his tremendous success.  Well, all sorts of economic data except the deficit numbers, maybe. But here’s the risk. With so many economic metrics already so strong, there’s likely only one direction the economy can head in the medium term: down.  Recent Federal Reserve forecasts suggest that we’ve already reached close to full employment, that inflation will soon pick up and that output growth will continue to slog along at our new normal of about 2 percent. Of course, Fed Chair Janet Yellen recently acknowledged that the delicate art of forecasting is especially challenging, given the “cloud of uncertainty” surrounding Trump’s fiscal policies. In the same news conference, she also gingerly suggested that there might not be an obvious need for fiscal stimulus right now, given how close we are to full employment. Other economic analysts have noted that stimulus at this point risks overheating the economy. Not to mention that if Trump implemented some of the other wacky policies he’s flirted with  —   a trade war, mass deportation, defaulting on our federal debt obligations, returning to the gold standard  —   a painful recession would ensue, according to multiple   economic forecasters.  Regardless, the historical record suggests that four more years of expansion are unlikely. That is, even if recoveries don’t die of old age, and even if Trump doesn’t spark a worldwide financial crisis by refusing to raise the debt ceiling, it seems reasonable to expect that we might face a recession at some point during his presidency. So, what happens when the numbers turn against him? Three consequences seem likely.  One, the administration will start searching for scapegoats other than Trump’s own party and its choices. Immigrants, minorities, Fed officials: Watch out. Two, assuming Trump will have already signed a major fiscal stimulus package during an expansion, there won’t be much powder left in the keg when Keynesian stimulus is actually needed. That is, fiscal tools available to mitigate the recession will be unusually limited.  And three, the numbers will become suspect once again, and Trump may even try to mess with the official government numbers to suit his narrative. This  —   and not a recession,   or impotent policy response  —   would cause the most enduring damage to our democracy.    Read more here:   Lawrence H.

","   Robert Greenstein is president of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.           Poor Americans are facing the gravest threat to the federal safety net in decades as   Donald Trump takes office accompanied by a   Congress. The risks to essential benefits for tens of millions of   and   Americans include losing coverage extended to them by the Affordable Care Act, threats to the fundamental structure of the Medicaid   program for the poor and further reduction of already squeezed funding for scores of other important programs serving the most vulnerable Americans. First, Republicans are expected to seek significant cuts in what’s known as   discretionary spending, which includes many important programs for   and   people, such as rental vouchers for   families, programs to fight homelessness, job training, funding for poor school districts, Head Start for young children and Pell grants to help   students afford college. The reason for these cuts is that, for the first time, starting next fiscal year, Republican leaders appear inclined to let the harsh “sequestration” budget cuts take full effect. That would shrink funding for this budget category to its lowest level in at least half a century, measured as a share of the economy. And even deeper cuts, as proposed by the most recent House Republican budget and the   are possible.  More broadly, congressional Republicans are likely to follow the course set in every House GOP budget since 2011, as well as the most recent final   budget, in 2015. Every one of those budgets secured the bulk of its savings from programs for   people. In the House GOP’s most recent budget plan, 62 percent of a stunning $6 trillion in budget cuts over 10 years would come from such programs.  Both Trump and House GOP leaders have also proposed large tax cuts that would mainly benefit the most   and could cost several trillion dollars over the next decade. That, in turn, would likely force further rounds of cuts in domestic programs in future years to address the resulting increase in budget deficits.  Do we really want to increase hardship for tens of millions of   people even as we shower tax cuts on people at the top? Republicans have controlled both chambers of Congress in recent years, but their budget aspirations were checked by President Obama. With Trump about to take office, they will have the means to enact their radical visions into law. And they will likely have a key administration ally in Rep. Mick Mulvaney, a South Carolina Republican and   conservative whom Trump has picked to run the Office of Management and Budget. History shows that the biggest domestic policy changes generally come in a new president’s first year when the president’s party controls all the levers of power in Washington and uses a   budget process called “reconciliation” to ram through an agenda without needing a single vote from the other party.  To achieve their goals, Republican leaders plan to push through two major reconciliation bills in 2017.  The first, which could pass as early as January, would repeal the ACA’s coverage expansions and most likely take effect at the start of 2019. That would double the number of uninsured Americans, from 29 million to 59 million, and leave the United States with a higher uninsured rate than before the ACA, the Health Policy Center at the Urban Institute estimates. The second reconciliation bill could couple regressive tax cuts with a radical overhaul of Medicaid and possibly the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (food stamps) and even the Supplemental Security Income program for the elderly and disabled poor  —   three core   assistance programs. If previous House GOP budgets are a guide, Republicans will likely seek to eviscerate the basic structure of these programs, under which there are minimum federal eligibility and benefit standards and all eligible families who apply for benefits receive them. Recent House GOP budgets would instead give states fixed, inadequate pots of money (likely block grants) with sweeping state flexibility to respond to the funding reductions by restricting eligibility and cutting benefits.  That’s what happened after the 1996   law replaced guaranteed cash assistance for eligible poor families with a block grant that gave states broad flexibility over the funds. A year before the law took effect, 68 of every 100 poor families with children received cash assistance. Today, just 23 of every 100 poor families do. A comparable shrinking of health, food and cash assistance under Medicaid, food stamps and SSI would take critical benefits away from tens of millions of struggling   families and children, despite research indicating that basic assistance for poor children can boost their educational attainment and their earnings potential in adulthood.  Franklin Roosevelt once said  “The test of our progress is not whether we add more to the abundance of those who have much; it is whether we provide enough for those who have too little. ” If so, America is about to be tested.

"," VENEZUELA, WHICH was once Latin America’s richest country, has become an unwilling test site for how much economic and social stress a modern nation can tolerate before it descends into pure anarchy. This month its 31 million people lurched a big step closer to that breaking point, thanks to another senseless decree by its autocratic populist government. For years Venezuelans have struggled with mounting shortages of food, medicine and other consumer goods, as well as   inflation that has rendered the national currency, the bolivar, worthless. By this month the   bill, the largest note in circulation, was worth only 2 cents, forcing people to carry piles of them in order to make the most rudimentary purchases. Then came this coup: On Dec. 11, President Nicolás Maduro, an economically illiterate former bus driver, announced that all 6 billion   notes would cease to be legal tender in just 72 hours. He also closed Venezuela’s borders with Colombia and Brazil, on the theory that traders were hoarding currency in those countries. Almost overnight, millions of Venezuelans  —   about 40 percent of whom do not have bank accounts in which the currency could be deposited  —   lost the ability to purchase even those goods still available on the market. The result was predictable: looting and riots in at least eight cities. In the eastern town of Ciudad Bolivar, with a population of some 400, 000, hundreds of stores were looted and at least three people were killed in three days of mayhem.  Mr. Maduro was forced to modify his fiat, extending the currency’s validity to Jan. 2 and reopening the borders. The government says it will distribute new bills in larger denominations. Meanwhile, the president is doing his best to blame the United States for the fiasco, claiming that it had somehow been orchestrated by President Obama . Venezuelans no longer believe such nonsense. A survey released this month by pollster Alfredo Keller showed that only 1 percent said the United States was to blame for the country’s crisis, while 76 percent blamed Mr. Maduro and the regime founded by Hugo Chávez.   said they believed children were dying because of a lack of food and medicine, and 98 percent said they had been unable to find essential products. Only 19 percent said they still supported the regime.  That the Maduro government somehow staggers on is due to its refusal to allow a constitutionally permitted presidential recall referendum ; a divided opposition; a military deeply compromised by corruption, including drug trafficking; and the diversion of international pressure  —   including from the United States  —   into feckless and futile attempts to promote negotiations between the government and the opposition. Instead of an   political transition or a   revolution, Venezuela is undergoing a comprehensive breakdown of order unlike anything Latin America has seen in decades. That its hemispheric neighbors witness this implosion without using the means they have to bring meaningful pressure to bear on the government renders the failure all the more profound.

","     Looking at the decimated landscape for Democrats  —   out of the White House, holding fewer than 20 governorships, and in the minority in the House, Senate and vast majority of statehouses  —   it is tempting to blame President Obama for the party’s plight. In one real sense, this is correct: With the White House in Democratic hands for eight years and sclerotic House and Senate leaders, a generation of young and capable talent has not developed. The Democratic Party stuck with Hillary Clinton in large part because there was no viable alternative. However, Republicans miss the mark, we would argue, in declaring with certainty that Obama’s results  —   Obamacare, foreign policy retrenchment, fiscal irresponsibility  —   caused the downfall of Democrats. Maybe. Then again, governors and state legislatures generally did not run on Obamacare and were not forced to account for the exploding national debt. Moreover, many Republicans were proponents of foreign policy retrenchment and guilty of fiscal irresponsibility. Maybe Democrats’ collapse occurred in spite of Obama and not because of him. In his rather   interview with David Axelrod (could we have expected anything else?) Obama declared, “If I had run again and articulated [my vision] I think I could’ve mobilized a majority of the American people to rally behind it. ” He might be right, and that’s the problem staring Democrats in the face. Obama had the ability to supercharge his base in part because he was the first African American president. His ability to skewer opponents while maintaining an air of moral superiority served him well in two elections. That is personal to him, not reflective of the party as a whole or even of Obama’s ideology. We should also remember the circumstances under which he won. In 2008 he ran as a historic figure just as the economy melted down. It would have been extraordinary had he lost. In 2012 he ran against a candidate who bet on dissatisfaction with the economy and suggested 47 percent of the electorate were   oafs. Obama won, but by a smaller margin than in 2008. Perhaps, then, Obama’s identity as a historic figure and as a heartthrob for liberals, combined with the collapse of the economy (while Republicans were on watch) and    opponents  —   rather than anything the Democratic Party was offering  —   was the key to his success, a success that masked a hollowness in the Democratic Party’s message and agenda. A party has to have selling and staying power beyond a single individual and when fortuitous circumstances don’t exist. Democrats are not alone in reaching an ideological dead end. Republicans’ stale 1980s agenda allowed   populism (however wrongheaded we may think it is) to emerge and replace conservatism as the ethos of the GOP. (And lest Republicans get too cocky, it surely would have been   to win the presidency had Vice President Biden, for example, run.) Democrats’ dilemma is not unique or insoluble. First, a message of straight identity politics and reflexive appeal to federal   expansion needs updating, to put it mildly. Unifying themes and objectives  —   reducing poverty by X percent, graduating X number of engineers, rebuilding X percent of the country’s physical infrastructure  —   have the potential to add to the Democratic coalition. Second, like the original  progressives of the early 2oth century,   progressives must be the party of good, clean government dedicated to rooting out corruption,   and favoritism. They’ll have a poster boy for their   efforts in the person of Donald Trump. Third, the electorate, for better or for worse, does not necessarily consider politics to be preparation for elected office. In looking for a new generation of talent, the party should cast a wide net to business, philanthropy, etc.  —   to figures who embodies a   modern ethos, not one that relies on   nostalgia. Fourth, if Republicans are going to be the party of nativism and   the Democrats have to be the party that prepares and supports Americans as they compete in the   economy. Promising to cut off trade or suggesting Wall Street is synonymous with fraud will not do it. When   whites in the Rust Belt find health care is less secure and a trade war does not produce   jobs, they will look for practical solutions. Democrats better have some. Finally, Obama may be retiring, but voters still want inspiration, a sense of belonging and, yes, hope and change. A president who continues to appeal to the worst instincts and who sees the economy as a fixed pie (ironically, two unconservative sensibilities) leaves an opening for a party who preaches “more” is better  —   more innovation, more   workers, more trade, more educational opportunities. In sum, parties tend to be victims of their own success. With Obama exiting, Democrats have the opportunity to turn the page on moldy ideas and build a unifying message. Let’s see if they seize it."

","       George Michael was given only 53 years in this world, but he made them count. He was still a teenager in 1982 when he began triggering worldwide   as a member of Wham! Five years and a few hairstyles later, he went solo, wiggled the backside of his Levi’s on MTV and became a global sex symbol. By the time 2004 rolled around, he was staging a big comeback at age 40, and he divulged the riddle of his craft that year in the pages of British GQ: “People have always thought I wanted to be seen as a serious musician, but I didn’t, I just wanted people to know that I was absolutely serious about pop music. ”  He had recently issued what would be his fifth and final studio album, “Patience,” a sensuous, sprawling meditation on sex, war, grief and commitment. Playful one moment and contemplative the next, the album seemed to give Michael an opportunity to sort out some important truths about pop itself: that our pleasure is not frivolous, and that heavy ideas travel further when they’re floating on bright melodies.  Now  —   after the British superstar died of heart failure in his home on Christmas Day  —   Michael’s legacy seems to run in poignant parallel to those of other pop gods we lost in 2016. Like Prince, he sang about the transcendental potential of human sexuality, and like David Bowie, he sought liberation through reinvention. In 1987, Michael donned an iconic leather jacket in the music video for “Faith. ” Three years later, he was burning it on a coat hanger in his video for “Freedom ’90. ” Fantastic.    George Michael leaves a news conference for the film “George Michael  —   A Different Story” in Berlin in February 2005. (Tobias  )  And if freedom was what Michael was preaching in 1990, freedom is what we were hearing on “Patience” in 2004. In the years leading up to the album, he broke ranks with other   superstars, writing and performing antiwar songs, including “Shoot the Dog,” a dance floor satire that skewered Tony Blair and George W. Bush. But in the context of “Patience,” the teasing mood of “Shoot the Dog” clashed powerfully with the album’s title track, a ballad about feeling blinkered by the war machine. Fingertips barely touching the piano, Michael asks, “Is it my imagination, or did God already leave the table?” That’s the kind of lyric that sends you scrambling back through an artist’s songbook, searching for everything you missed the first time around. (And about that: Has there ever been an opening line more deliciously flirty than, “Well, I guess it would be nice if I could touch your body”?)            before embarking on a solo career, died at 53.

142484,217973,Russia avoids suggesting terrorism caused plane crash that killed 92 en route to Syria,Washington Post,Andrew Roth,2016-12-26,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161227003658/https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/russia-avoids-suggesting-terrorism-caused-plane-crash-that-killed-92-en-route-to-syria/2016/12/26/3c8f0198-cb78-11e6-85cd-e66532e35a44_story.html
","  MOSCOW  —   Russia on Monday played down the likelihood that terrorism was behind the crash of a   military jet that killed 92 people on Christmas Day, a disaster that prompted a national day of mourning and that has drawn added scrutiny as Russia’s role in the war in Syria increasingly marks it as a target.  Russia’s Federal Security Service told the Interfax news agency that there has been no evidence “indicating the possibility of a terrorist attack or an act of sabotage on board” the   jet, which lost contact with air traffic controllers Sunday just one minute after taking off from the southern Russian city of Sochi. The crash site was pinpointed Monday about a mile off the Black Sea coast, where divers found the fuselage and other parts of the plane strewn over a distance of about 500 yards, Russia’s Defense Ministry said. The plane initially took off from a heavily guarded military airfield in Moscow, officials said, and was under close watch during refueling in Sochi, making it unlikely that someone placed a bomb onboard.  By late Monday, divers had recovered parts of at least 80 bodies of those aboard the flight; other victims may have been swept out to sea with the current.    Rescuers carry fragments and remains found at the site of the   plane crash Sunday near the Black Sea Russian city of Sochi. No survivors have been found, and the remains of at least 11 people have been recovered. (Yevgeny   Pressphoto Agency)  Russian investigators said they were considering a number of technical and other accidental causes, including “foreign objects getting into the engine,   fuel” and pilot or mechanical error.   The crash of the   which was carrying military officers, musicians, journalists and others to Syria, was the single deadliest incident tied to Russia’s intervention there since a passenger jet exploded over the Sinai Peninsula in November 2015, killing all 224 people aboard.  An Islamic State affiliate claimed responsibility for that attack and linked it to Russia’s intervention in Syria. Russian authorities later said an explosive device had been smuggled onboard.  In televised comments, Russian President Vladi mir Putin called for a full investigation and declared Monday a national day of mourning for the crew and passengers.  Among the dead were more than 60 members of the Alexandrov Ensemble, also known as the Red Army Choir, which had recently gained widespread recognition for its rendition of the “James Bond” theme song “Skyfall. ” The group was traveling to Syria to hold a concert for Russian soldiers and airmen deployed there.

Can she keep her own son out of the system?,Washington Post,Jessica Contrera,2016-12-25,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161227003658/https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/she-was-raised-in-dozens-of-foster-homes-can-she-keep-her-own-son-out-of-the-system/2016/12/24/0b70a46a-beec-11e6-ac85-094a21c44abc_story.html
","      Gwen Wright needed to get to the hospital. The labor pains were radiating from deep in her gut, like pliers twisting her insides. First they were an hour apart, now every 30 minutes. She was a week past her due date, and the baby was coming. But when she stepped off the Metro that spring day in 2015, she turned in the opposite direction from the hospital. She had an appointment to keep  —   an interview that could change everything for her and her son on the way. “Sorry I’m late,” she told the women seated at a folding table in a drab conference room at a nonprofit’s office in Northwest Washington. They smiled back at her and asked polite questions, nodding as she described her hopes for her son.     At 20, Gwen had no idea how to be a mother. The last time she’d seen her own mother, she was 2. Someone else had tried to be her parent, and then someone else, again and again until  —   just before Gwen was too old to be in the   system any longer  —   the pregnancy test strip turned pink. “I just want him to have a better life than I did,” Gwen explained, holding her protruding stomach. She knew her son was far more likely to end up in the system, parentless, just as she had been. But she was being given a chance to break that cycle. An organization called Generations of Hope was launching a social experiment that had never been tried before. The group was constructing a small apartment building where foster    would live alongside seniors  —     figures who would offer support but who also needed support themselves. In return for subsidized rent, the moms and seniors would help one another get by. Gwen was determined to live in the building. So during her   interview, she avoided talking about her past. She didn’t tell them about the act of violence that led to her pregnancy. She’d already had to explain that night to her siblings, who knew she was gay, and she couldn’t bear to describe it again. She didn’t mention her fear that when her son was placed in her arms, she wouldn’t recognize his features. Instead, she assured the organizers and herself, her son would not go into foster care. She wouldn’t let people walk in and out of his life, she said. “I just want my son to be able to say, ‘My mother did all that she could.’ ”  Then Gwen thanked the women for their time and walked more than a mile to MedStar Washington Hospital Center to prove herself right. ‘Welcome home’    A light shines at Genesis, where foster    live alongside seniors who offer support in exchange for receiving support themselves. (Evelyn   The Washington Post)  Seven months later, rain was pouring down on Gwen’s new home. She longed to be upstairs in her   apartment, with its crisp white walls and humming refrigerator, its cabinets filled with red Hawaiian Punch for herself, Gerber formula for her son, Amarion. Gwen loved how the apartment smelled. Like nothing. She’d always lived in places filled with other people’s smells. She was sitting beneath a stuffy tent in the building’s back parking lot, surrounded by all her new neighbors and dozens of   people who had come for the Nov. 19, 2015, grand opening of the building on Georgia Avenue, just south of the Maryland border. It had been named “Genesis” as a symbol of new beginnings. Gwen took a seat in a row of people in suits. She wore cargo pants. Amarion wore a bib that said, “Spit happens. ” For the past seven months, she’d been learning how to be his mother  —   how to mash bananas and sweet potatoes the way he liked, how to hold him with his head against her chest, how to decide whether to take him to the doctor. When Amarion wailed for hours in the middle of the night, Gwen would stay awake until 4 a. m. with him, often crying just as hard. Her new neighbors were struggling with being mothers, too. In a city with more than 1, 100 children in foster care, these eight young women had been chosen to keep history from repeating itself. Their own parents had abandoned them, disappeared into prisons or been shot to death. One young woman had a mother who would whip her naked body with a cord, then pour alcohol into her wounds. When the torture was over, she would take her children out and buy them toys. Tyaira Barber, 21, grew up praying for her mother to get out of jail, then praying for her to stop doing drugs. Tyaira moved to her sister’s house, then to her cousin’s, to her school friend’s, to her boyfriend’s. She would do anything to hide that she was homeless. She refused to be a foster kid. Until she was 16, and couldn’t hide the growing bump beneath her jeans.   At the same Child and Family Services Agency building where Tyaira turned herself in, Antonee Fox was dropped off by her mother. She was 16. In one arm, she held her    son, Noah. In the other, a car seat carrying her infant son, Tarif. “I can’t do this anymore,” Antonee’s mom told her in the car. “You got two kids. Woman up. ” And then all Antonee’s belongings were in seven bags on the agency’s curb, and her mom was pulling away. Now a $7. 2 million,   apartment building was designed to make sure her kids didn’t end up with the same stories.  “Well, good morning, everybody!” D. C. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) told the crowd beneath the tent. “Welcome to Ward 4! And welcome home!” Home. Community. Home. Community. Every person who took to the microphone kept stressing the same words, and each time, the crowd clapped. Gwen joined them, applauding for all the groups who made this place possible for her: the city, the nonprofits Mi Casa and Generations of Hope, the donors, the social workers who had shaped her childhood. So far, it was a community of strangers. But the mayor sounded certain it would become much more. Where Genesis stood now, she said, there used to be two large   homes. Both were abandoned. The bushes out front grew wild. In one, squatters lit the roof on fire. They sat empty for years, until the city came and tore them down. And from a pile of rubble, they were trying to build something better.     Gwen, second from right, and her siblings during childhood. Although her sister and two brothers were adopted, Gwen never was. (Courtesy of Gwen Wright)     Gwen’s son, Amarion, eats dinner in the community room at Genesis, which is designed to help keep him and other children out of the   system (Evelyn   The Washington Post)    A generation of neglected children Gwen’s story started with fire, too. She was 2 years old. Her older brother was 4. Their mother had left them alone in her Southeast Washington apartment. The stove was on. The flames came fast. If it weren’t for the neighbors who knocked down the door, that’s where Gwen’s story would have ended. She later learned, she said, that her mother was down the street, getting high. She never saw her again. In the   the crack epidemic was at the end of its rage, and the city was in its withdrawal period. A flood of children had been left uncared for. The   system was so overwhelmed it was being sued for negligence. Children were living in temporary emergency shelters. Reports of abuse and malnourishment went uninvestigated. In 1995, a federal judge took control of the system from the District.   Today, social workers call the hundreds of kids who came into the city’s care at that time the “youth bubble” or the “legacy kids. ” Without an effective system to find them permanent homes, the children grew up moving from one temporary setting to another, often without ever being adopted. That was Gwen’s life. First she moved to her grandparents’ house, but her grandmother died soon after. Then she moved in with a family she doesn’t remember. Then to a family she remembers wanting to be adopted by. Even though their teenage son would take Gwen and her younger sister into his room to play “games” that were anything but. Even though the foster mother would whip them with a Home Depot paint stick. One day at school, her teacher saw the welts. And so Gwen moved again. And again. By the time she turned 21, she estimated, she had lived in more than 40 places.  Connections and conflict The bare cream walls at Genesis exploded with color. Over the course of a year, a mural artist helped the residents paint birds and butterflies using stencils that could be mastered by young and old. Then the artist painted each member of the community onto the walls so every person who walked into the building could see who called this place home. There was Gwen, holding Amarion in her arms. Tyaira, with    daughter Aniya on her lap and    daughter Audreyy at her side. Smiling beside the moms were colorful renderings of the elders: Dellie Reed, a brassy Louisiana native who couldn’t keep her house after her husband died of bone cancer. Ernie Osunkoya, who came from Nigeria to America to be a doctor, and found cocaine instead. Bonnie Duffy Page, who herself had become a mom at 16  —   and then a grandmother at 33  —   before suffering multiple strokes that limited her mobility. Together, they had become neighbors, saying hello in the halls, borrowing corn bread mix and can openers, giving one another rides to Walmart. The seniors knew whose child liked to color and whose liked to bang on the piano. Miss Dellie took the older kids to summer camp at her church. Miss Bonnie left her door unlocked so the moms could stop by to watch Wendy Williams with her, or confide how overwhelmed they felt. Mr. Ernie would greet everyone with a   “helloooo” in his Ni ger ian accent, then ask, “How are you doing today?”     Tyaira Barber hugs Dellie Reed during a Friday night women’s group meeting at Genesis. (Evelyn   The Washington Post)     Tyaira, a nursing assistant, carries her daughter Audreyy, 2, on the way to pick up her daughter Aniya, 4, from school. (Evelyn   The Washington Post)    But the connections they’d made couldn’t erase their problems. Tyaira was raising her daughters on her own. Her unpredictable schedule as a nursing assistant meant she often needed babysitters, but she barely trusted any of the adults at Genesis enough to let them close to her kids. Miss Dellie was struggling to pay her rent, but she was too proud to ask anyone in the building for help. Gwen couldn’t find a steady job, so she enrolled in a   mechanic training program that paid $10. 25 an hour. It was all the way in Southeast Washington; to get Amarion to day care and make it there on time, she had to leave her apartment by 6 a. m. and take three buses. By the time she came back to Genesis, she was too tired to talk to anyone. Generations of Hope had built intergenerational communities such as this one across the country. There were always growing pains, especially during the first year. But those communities had been centered on adults raising foster children. Genesis was the first to focus on foster children raising children of their own, and the first to be created in the close, unforgiving quarters of a city apartment building. Noise was a constant source of conflict. One older woman called the police on a young mom for having her TV too loud. There were fights over who could park in the small lot behind the building. After Miss Bonnie tried to resolve a dispute, she found her tires slashed. “I was looking for a peaceful place,” she said after she had the tires replaced. “I knew there was going to be some challenges, but I didn’t expect all these issues to come up. ” Many of the young moms had boyfriends who practically lived with them  —   against the terms of their leases. One woman had given birth to a third child, and two others were pregnant. Some seniors suspected that the boyfriends were responsible for the disappearance of speakers and routers from the community spaces. But kick all the men out, and some of the moms would lose reliable father figures who provided financial support and took out the trash for the older neighbors. Each week, there was an issue to smooth. The program managers who worked in the building, Wendy Jason and John Kemp, believed Genesis would only work if the community solved its problems together. If they interfered too much, that harmony would never form. If they interfered too little, arguments would boil over into screaming matches in the halls.    Bonnie Duffy Page, sitting on her walker, leads a women’s group discussion at Genesis. There, the women talk about their daily lives and  —   if Miss Bonnie brings along vodka and orange juice  —   their romantic endeavors. (Evelyn   The Washington Post)  So they put their trust in time and filled the evenings with potlucks, Zumba sessions, art classes, “coffee and chat,” “ice cream and chat. ”  At weekly ladies’ nights, the women talked hair and doctors and church and  —   when Miss Bonnie brought vodka and orange juice along  —   men and relationships. “You must have done it with a man at least once, right?” one of them asked Gwen one night as 10 women sat around a folding table. They’d seen the way she dressed in baggy clothes and   hats. They’d met the woman she started dating shortly after moving in. They had always wondered about her pregnancy, and she’d never explained. “Well, I. . . ” Gwen started. “Was it rape?” Miss Dellie asked. For a moment, Gwen let herself remember that night. Stopping by the   on her way to her foster home. Hearing someone behind her. Taking the shortcut near the woods. Being thrown to the ground. Closing her eyes, waiting for it to be over. A month later, she bought a pregnancy test and discovered that a violent man’s child was inside her. Yet she didn’t want to get rid of the baby. She didn’t believe in abortion. And having the child, she thought, would mean she would always have a family. It barely occurred to her to tell her foster mother, or the police, or anyone but her siblings that she had been raped. She had never trusted the adults in her life. Now, at least, that had changed She looked up at her neighbors and answered Miss Dellie’s question: “Yes. ” A place of their own Christmas was coming, and Amarion, now 18 months old, was walking and talking. He looked, thankfully, so much like Gwen. Big brown eyes. Full cheeks. His expressions were serious, except when Gwen plugged her phone in to an old boombox and turned on music. Then he loved to wiggle. “Are you ready to put up your tree?” Gwen asked him earlier this month.    Amarion helps his mother, Gwen, decorate their Christmas tree earlier this month. (Jessica Contrera   Washington Post)  Amarion reached out to the cardboard box holding the fake white tree Gwen bought for $25 in October, as soon as Walmart set out its Christmas decorations. Her   sat in the corner with her headphones and sunglasses on in defiance. When they got together, they had made an agreement: Gwen wouldn’t let people walk in and out of her son’s life. If they were going to be together, Gwen said, her girlfriend would have to commit to being Amarion’s mother even if they broke up. Then they did break up. And now they were constantly fighting in front of Amarion. But this was the first Christmas Gwen thought he might remember, so she wasn’t about to change her mind. “Are you going to take your headphones out?” Gwen demanded as she pulled the   tree out of the box. The headphones stayed in. Gwen looked away and sifted through a Dollar Tree bag filled with blue candy canes and boxes of glittery ornaments. She opened one and found only baubles, no hooks to place them on the tree. “Didn’t you buy them?” her ex asked. “When you buy ornaments, wouldn’t you think the hangers would come with it?” Gwen said, distressed. Her ex shook her head. “Well, I have never done this!” Gwen snapped. She walked to her closet and found a bundle of black yarn. Plopping down on the couch, she started cutting it into small pieces. She slipped each strand through the loops on the ornaments, tied the ends together and cut off the extra. Her son would have golden ornaments. Her son would go see Santa at the mall. Her son would rip open presents on Christmas morning. “Ready?” she asked him. “Show me where you want it. ” Amarion pointed with a finger covered in melted candy cane. Gwen slid the ornament onto the plastic branch. Then he tottered away and began playing with the cardboard box instead, like a boy who would never celebrate Christmas without a tree they’d decorated together.

142486,217975,They served an abusive regime. The U.N. made them peacekeepers anyway.,Washington Post,Kevin Sieff,2016-12-26,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161227003658/https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/africa/they-served-an-abusive-government-the-un-made-them-peacekeepers-anyway/2016/12/23/05c0a5ad-108f-46b9-b6f7-5f2303f6cdfe_story.html
","         BUTARE, Rwanda  —   The three officers had received blue badges and slipped blue covers over their helmets. They were now U. N. peacekeepers, sent from Burundi to help protect victims of a brutal war in the Central African Republic.  But each of them had a past the United Nations was unaware of. When the deployments became public, Burundian activists were aghast. One of the officers had run a military jail where beatings and torture occurred, according to   groups and former prisoners. Another had committed human rights violations when   demonstrations erupted in Burundi last year, U. N. officials would eventually learn. The third had served as the spokesman for the Burundian army, publicly defending an institution accused of abuses. They set out for the Central African Republic in different U. N. deployments over the past year. In each case, U. N. officials soon determined that the allegations against the soldiers and their units were credible enough to send them home. The three cases point to a deeper problem: even as the United Nations’ peacekeeping responsibilities grow, it has proven incapable of excluding potential human rights violators from its ranks. The United Nations is managing 16 peacekeeping missions around the globe, with over 100, 000 uniformed personnel and an annual $8 billion budget, more than 25 percent of it paid by the United States. As the world body scrambles to fulfill its commitments, it is recruiting some peacekeepers from militaries that have records of abuse or serve repressive governments. Yet the United Nations does not have an effective system to weed out those with   backgrounds. That puts the institution at risk of deploying peacekeepers who will tarnish its credibility and even harm the people they were meant to protect. The United Nations has faced a growing crisis over allegations of sexual abuse by its forces. Since 2008, U. N. troops, police and civilian officials have been accused of more than 700 cases of sexual abuse and exploitation, as well as other crimes, according to its records. In Burundi, the government has used its security forces  —   including the military  —   to punish its political opponents, a U. N.  team of human rights experts warned in September, adding that the forces were committing “gross violations” of human rights. The team recommended that the world body “phase out” its use of Burundian peacekeepers. A senior U. N. spokesman, Farhan Haq, announced in June that it would not accept more Burundian police as peacekeepers in the Central African Republic after the   contingent finished its tour, “given the current allegations of serious and ongoing human rights violations in Burundi. ”    However, the United Nations continues to employ more than 800 Burundian soldiers in the Central African Republic, where senior officials say the troops are necessary to keep the peace. The United Nations also supports 5, 400 Burundian troops through the African Union’s mission in Somalia. Over the years, those missions have provided millions of dollars to the Burundian government for supplying the troops.  The Washington Post traced the cases of the three Burundian officers  —   Maj. Pierre Niyonzima, Lt. Col. Alfred Mayuyu and Col. Gaspard Baratuza  —   through interviews with U. N. officials, human rights groups and former Burundian soldiers and dissidents in that country and in exile. Government and military officials in Burundi did not respond to messages about the cases. Ernest Ndabashinze, Burundi’s ambassador to Washington, defended the professionalism of his country’s peacekeepers and said the accusations against the men were part of a “campaign of misinformation” directed by his country’s political opposition. Human rights groups say the United Nations’ failure to properly vet its forces undermines its mandate. “The weakest and most vulnerable around the world rely on the U. N. to protect them, but it won’t be able to fulfill their expectations if its members send protectors who are known abusers back home,” said Akshaya Kumar, deputy U. N. director at Human Rights Watch. Screening at home In Burundi, as elsewhere, the United Nations relies on the governments that are contributing peacekeepers to screen them. The United Nations “does not have dedicated resources to carry out human rights screening of individual contingent members, nor do we have the means to assess the records of individuals,” the U. N. spokesman Haq said in an email. That might not be a problem in most countries  —   and indeed the Burundian military was once considered a relatively disciplined fighting force. But by the time Niyonzima was dispatched as a U. N. peacekeeper in December 2015, the situation in his country had changed. Eight months earlier, Burundian President Pierre Nkurunziza’s party had nominated him for a third term, prompting angry demonstrations by citizens who deemed the move unconstitutional. A failed military attempt to overthrow the government in May added to the turmoil. Security forces opened fire on protesters, killing and injuring scores of people, and cracked down on suspected government foes, arresting hundreds, according to Human Rights Watch and other international groups. Most of the abuses were attributed to the police and government intelligence officers, but news reports cited witnesses as saying some soldiers used live ammunition against demonstrators. After Niyonzima was deployed, the United Nations learned of allegations that he and two other Burundian peacekeepers had committed abuses in their homeland. The U. N. human rights office “has raised serious concerns about alleged human rights violations committed by the officers during the violent demonstrations which started in Burundi since April 2015,” said a memo obtained by The Post dated Feb. 5, 2016, and issued by Lt. Gen. Maqsood Ahmed, of the U. N. peacekeeping office in New York. The memo, which ordered the repatriation of Niyonzima and the two other men, was first disclosed by New   Inner City Press. “The U. N. did a background check that revealed allegations of his [Niyonzima’s] direct implication in serious human rights violations” in Burundi, a senior U. N. peacekeeping official in New York said in an email. He spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the case. The official did not provide details. But two former military officers who broke with the government, and are now refugees in Rwanda, said members of Niyonzima’s unit had fired into a crowd of unarmed protesters in the capital in May 2015. “And this is the guy they send?” asked one of the men, a    former army captain, in an interview in Butare, Rwanda, near the border with Burundi. The former captain and another   claimed that, in the same month, they saw Niyonzima among a group of soldiers and police who stormed a hospital in the capital where wounded coup supporters were being treated. Media reports after the attack on the Bumerec hospital showed bullet marks in the walls and blood on the floors. The security forces exchanged gunfire with people inside the hospital before detaining two wounded soldiers and one of their colleagues, according to Human Rights Watch. Like several other witnesses and government critics who spoke to The Post, the former officers who provided the accounts spoke on the condition of anonymity, citing concerns about their security and the safety of relatives still in Burundi.    A former Burundian soldier, now in exile in Rwanda, shows scars from a gunshot wound and other injuries that he said he sustained when police and soldiers stormed Bumerec hospital in the Burundian capital in May 2015. The soldier said that Pierre Niyonzima was among the security forces involved in the attack. (Jane   The Washington Post)  Niyonzima did not respond to emails from The Post seeking comment. Ndabashinze, the ambassador, said the allegations against the Burundian military and the soldiers it nominates as peacekeepers “are part of a strategy of manipulating the international community. ” He also said that Burundi vets its prospective peacekeeping troops.  “The results are there,” he said. “When they are deployed, they do their jobs in a professional manner. ” Beyond Burundi Burundi’s military isn’t the only one that supplies peacekeepers despite a widely criticized human rights record. Congo sent 850 peacekeepers to the Central African Republic as part of an A. U. mission that in 2014 was absorbed by the United Nations. For years, Congo’s military has been accused by human rights groups of raping and killing civilians during a civil war.  The United Nations announced in January that it was ending Congo’s role in the mission in the Central African Republic, after finding that incoming troops failed to meet U. N. standards for vetting, training and equipment. U. N. officials said privately that the move was also in response to abuse allegations against the Congolese peacekeepers. At least 21 of them have been accused of raping or exploiting women and children during their assignments in the Central African Republic, according to the United Nations. In many developing countries, peacekeeping assignments are considered a reward. In Burundi, a lieutenant makes about $500 per year but can earn more than $12, 000 as a U. N. peacekeeper, according to interviews with eight former Burundian soldiers. Current and former soldiers said the Burundian government frequently reserved the coveted peacekeeping nominations for loyalists. “You have no chance unless you’re seen as protecting the regime,” said one army captain who fled Burundi after the coup attempt. Mayuyu was a government loyalist, an officer who had run a military detention center in Bujumbura where military and civilian dissidents were sent after the coup, according to Burundian   groups and eight men, interviewed separately, who spent time in the prison. In August, a journalist asked at a U. N. news briefing in New York whether Mayuyu was being deployed as a peacekeeper, adding that the soldier had been linked to a unit “that was involved in torture and other abuse” in Burundi. The response was no. Then, weeks later, Stephane Dujarric, the U. N.  ’s spokesman, acknowledged to reporters that Mayuyu had been serving as a U. N. military observer in the Central African Republic since July, but added that he was being “repatriated with immediate effect. ” According to U. N. officials, Mayuyu had failed to disclose his role in the military police in his paperwork.  “He had served in one of the units implicated in human rights abuses, but he had omitted that information,” said the U. N. official in New York, speaking on the condition of anonymity. He did not elaborate. Four of the former prisoners said they had been tortured or beaten in Mayuyu’s jail. One, a    former military officer, said that during an interrogation, soldiers tied his arms behind his back and placed a wrench on his testicles. As he was questioned, the soldiers twisted the wrench, he said. Mayuyu wasn’t one of the torturers, he said, but he was responsible for the detention center. Another prisoner, a    former army captain, said interrogators stabbed him in the thigh with a steak knife as he sat in a chair, his hands tied behind his back. “Over and over,” he said, adding that Mayuyu did not administer the torture and was not present at the time. The two prisoners, who have been convicted of supporting the coup, spoke by phone from a different jail in central Burundi. It was not possible to independently confirm their accounts. Reached by phone, Mayuyu said he was sent home “based on rumors” and denied the allegations of torture. He acknowledged that he commanded the military police unit but said there was no prison on his base. He said he didn’t think it was relevant to list his unit on his U. N. forms. Acts of violence The United Nations and human rights groups have become increasingly alarmed about the Burundian security forces’ role in the violence in their country. In January, Amnesty International said it had found evidence of what appeared to be five mass graves near the Burundian capital, suggesting “a deliberate effort by the authorities to cover up the extent of the killings by their security forces. ” In a report that month, the United Nations accused Burundian security forces of raping women in neighborhoods sympathetic to the opposition. Willy Nyamitwe, the Burundian government spokesman,  said in September that criticism of the country’s human rights record consisted of “gratuitous assertions based on flying rumors and gossip. ”    Every month, the United Nations pays Burundi $1, 300 for each soldier deployed to a peacekeeping mission, and the government keeps about $200, using the rest for the individual’s salary, according to interviews with seven current and former Burundian troops. The United Nations permits such a practice, and a number of other countries do something similar. But Burundian human rights groups have expressed concern that the funds are benefiting the financially troubled government. In addition to its   military contingent in the Central African Republic, Burundi has 5, 400 troops in Somalia. They are attached to an A. U. mission, which is responsible for vetting the soldiers. The mission, however, is supported financially and logistically by the United Nations, United States and European Union. The E. U. is planning to start paying the Burundian troops in Somalia directly, to avoid funding their government, according to a senior E. U. official who spoke on the condition of anonymity for diplomatic reasons. “It is inconceivable that the United Nations and African Union want to protect peace in Somalia and other parts of the world by funding the repression in Burundi and rewarding criminals,” said Pacifique Nininahazwe, the president of the Forum for Awareness and Development, a Burundian human rights organization. The United Nations has struggled to find countries willing to send their troops to violent, remote regions, including some in   Africa. “It’s so hard to generate troops to go to C. A. R. that we can’t afford to lose the Burundians,” said a second U. N. peacekeeping official in New York. Haq, the U. N. spokesman, said that removing the Burundian troops, who are based near the Central African Republic’s capital and close to an area controlled by armed groups, would create a “security vacuum” in a “strategically sensitive location. ” As for U. N. money benefiting the Burundian government, “we do not have the means by which to control the use by a government of reimbursements made to it,” the spokesman said. But he added that the deployment of the Burundians was “under constant review. ” Complaints multiply As more Burundian troops have served in the Central African Republic, more complaints against them have emerged. In July, a soldier was accused of sexually abusing a    girl in Kemo prefecture. Another allegedly raped and impregnated a    in the capital, Bangui. This month, the United Nations announced that it had identified 25 Burundian peacekeepers in the Central African Republic who were “possible perpetrators” of sexual abuse against women and girls in the past two year in Kemo. It has not released the names of the accused. “They are sending us guys who shouldn’t be here,” said one senior U. N. official in the country, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of diplomatic sensitivities.  In theory, if the United Nations has doubts about a country’s vetting procedures, it can conduct its own background checks. But in Burundi, such checks rarely occur, according to U. N. officials, because the U. N. agencies and watchdog organizations that would normally gather such information have been prevented from working.  Perhaps the most jarring illustration of the feeble U. N. vetting system was the case of Baratuza. In   2015, he set out for the Central African Republic, chosen by his country to serve as the new spokesman for the U. N. peacekeeping mission. Burundian civic activists erupted in outrage, launching a Twitter campaign with the hashtag #SendBaratuzaBack.     Col. Gaspard Baratuza, a spokesman for Burundi’s army, addresses reporters in Cibitoke in 2014. When he was chosen for U. N. duty, civic activists were outraged. They launched a Twitter campaign to stop him. (Renovat   Agency via Getty Images)  A simple Internet search would have shown that Baratuza had defended aggressive Burundian military operations while serving as army spokesman. What especially infuriated the activists was his comment that 79 “enemies” had been killed by government forces on Dec. 11, 2015, after attacks by armed men on several military installations in Bujumbura. Amnesty International reported that the deaths occurred as security forces raided neighborhoods sympathetic to the political opposition, dragging young men from their homes and executing them.   Dujarric, the U. N. spokesman, told a media briefing on Dec. 17, 2015, that Baratuza’s deployment had been “suspended. ” He was repatriated even before arriving in the Central African Republic, during a stopover in Uganda, officials said. He did not respond to messages from The Post. The United Nations did not comment publicly on what went wrong. But privately, the senior U. N. peacekeeping official in New York called the episode a significant error and “a demonstration of the limitation of our recruitment and screening. ”       "
142487,217976,Afghanistan’s vice president is known for brutality. But he may have gone too far.,Washington Post,Pamela Constable,2016-12-23,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161227003658/https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/afghanistans-vice-president-is-known-for-his-brutality-but-now-he-may-have-gone-too-far/2016/12/23/b5bcae7c-c6b3-11e6-acda-59924caa2450_story.html
","  KABUL  —   For 30 years, Gen. Abdurrashid Dostum has reigned as northern Afghanistan’s untouchable  : first as a ruthless   general, later as an armed U. S. ally against the Taliban and finally as a reliable, if unsavory, political boss who could deliver votes from his ethnic Uzbek followers. Dostum has long been infamous for his cruelty: He has reportedly ordered tanks driven over enemies’ legs and been accused of suffocating hundreds of Taliban prisoners in sealed truck containers. He is also known for violent and abusive rages. But none of the accusations ever landed him in serious trouble. He was either too intimidating, or too important, to challenge. But now, Dostum may have gone too far.  His latest alleged victim, a    former provincial governor named Ahmad Ishchi, has accused Dostum on television of imprisoning him, beating him and ordering him raped in November; Ishchi has also submitted to medical tests at a U. S. military hospital. This time, Dostum, 62, is not a warlord but the first vice president of a government backed by the United States and Europe  —   a heartbeat away from replacing President Ashraf Ghani.    Ahmad Ishchi, who says he was detained and assaulted on Dostum’s orders last month, displays an injury on his leg at his home in Kabul on Dec. 13. (Omar  )  And this time, Afghans nationwide  —   including members of Dostum’s   Uzbek minority  —   are reacting with outrage. Social media has exploded with unprintable jokes and images of Ghani and his aides wearing steel trousers. The burly strongman, who long controlled a strategic border region with Central Asia and publicly forced supplicants to kiss his hand, has become a national embarrassment.  Ghani, a former World Bank official, is under pressure from Western donors to prosecute Dostum and suspend him from office. Many Afghan analysts are calling this a    chance for Ghani to install the rule of law in a society where warlord culture has long prevailed. The attorney general announced last week that the allegations are being investigated “professionally” and “neutrally. ” “If Dostum is not arrested, it will be a huge dishonor, and the government will lose all credibility,” said Akbar Bai, 70, an Uzbek businessman who claimed he was beaten by Dostum in a drunken outburst in 2006. The incident ended with police surrounding the former general’s house in Kabul for months until he finally agreed to fly into exile in Turkey.  Many Afghans are skeptical that Ghani will be able to bring the former warlord to justice. His government has been weakened by internal divisions and a perceived lack of legitimacy, with legislative elections delayed repeatedly. This has made it vulnerable to pressure from outside groups, several of which are led by other powerful   leaders, including rivals of Dostum.   The president, who took power in 2014 promising to reform and modernize Afghan democracy, is also haunted by his own political compromises. He once denounced Dostum as a war criminal but then invited him to join his presidential ticket in a bid to secure the Uzbek vote. His predecessor, President Hamid Karzai, had also courted Dostum’s support despite the allegations of battlefield atrocities.  Ghani asserted that Dostum had reformed, saying that he was “not coming with a militia to take over Kabul. ” He added: “He’s coming in a suit, to be vice president, based on a democratic election, and that is a profound change. ” The suit did not fit comfortably, though, and Dostum spent most of his time in his stronghold, the northern city of Shebergan. This fall, he insisted on leading his militiamen out to do battle with the Taliban, then accused Ghani’s aides of conspiring against him when a Taliban ambush killed 50 of his troops.  Now, even in disgrace, Dostum is playing hardball. Refusing to leave Shebergan, he has called the assault accusation another political plot, accused Ishchi of collaborating with the Taliban and declared through intermediaries that he will never allow himself to be investigated or removed from his post. Any such move, they warn, could trigger forceful resistance and political chaos.  “General Dostum is not answerable to anyone,” his spokesman, Bashir Ahmad Tahianj, said in an interview, although he conceded that Dostum’s guards may have “misbehaved” with Ishchi. “We welcome an investigation, but the government should be very careful not to enlarge or politicize it. ” Dostum, he said, “has a long history, and he is the most popular leader in Afghanistan. He was elected by the people, and no one can take that away. ” Dostum still has influential friends, some dating to his collaboration with U. S. Special Operations forces who fought against the Taliban in late 2001. He also maintains ties in Russia and Central Asia from his time as a   military commander in the 1980s.  Moreover, he is only one of several former militia bosses with whom the Ghani government has compromised. In September, with support from Washington, the president signed a peace deal with longtime fugitive leader Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, hoping to persuade Taliban insurgents to follow suit. He has now asked the United Nations to remove Hekmatyar, a former U. S. Cold War ally, from an   blacklist.  “Dostum may be the poster child for impunity in Afghanistan, but he is not an anomaly,” Patricia Gossman, the U. S.  senior Afghan analyst for Human Rights Watch, wrote in an email. “If President Ghani wants to demonstrate that he is serious about accountability, it cannot start and stop with Dostum, and it cannot be seen as selective. ” Representatives of Dostum have proposed settling the Ishchi matter through a traditional gathering of elders, a process in which he might make amends or agree to live abroad. Aides to Ghani insist that if enough evidence is gathered to prosecute Dostum, he will be removed from the vice presidency. But they also acknowledge that putting him on trial or forcing him from office would be legally complicated and politically risky.  Even if Dostum avoids prosecution, however, Ishchi’s charges have brought new attention to other incidents in the general’s past. There is talk of reopening an international war crimes case for the alleged mass suffocation of Taliban prisoners in 2001, and several people have spoken up about previous alleged cases of abuse. According to Bai, a   Afghan senator was sexually assaulted on Dostum’s orders. Perhaps just as important, the old warlord’s sway over hundreds of thousands of ethnic Uzbeks in the north may be weakening. A crop of better educated, more moderate politicians has been waiting in the wings, serving in parliament and other posts. Dostum’s loss of stature, they suggest, may finally allow them to challenge his dominance. “In history, our leaders were poets and scholars, but when Russia invaded, warlords and illiterates emerged in power,” said Qudratullah Zaki, 45, an ethnic Uzbek legislator and an ally of Ghani. “Many people, including those who supported Dostum, realize that he is not morally qualified to hold his position. “This is no more the time for tyranny,” he added. “We need to deal with real issues, and we need to create hope again. ”      "
142488,217978,"Is everything shaping up for a Cowboys-Patriots Super Bowl, the NFL’s TV-ratings dream?",Washington Post,Mark Maske,2016-12-26,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161227003658/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/sports/wp/2016/12/26/is-everything-shaping-up-for-a-cowboys-patriots-super-bowl-the-nfls-tv-ratings-dream/
","     Each week, The Washington Post’s Mark Maske provides   Monday morning NFL analysis with “First and 10,” a dissection of the league’s most important developments from a weekend of action. First and 10: Dec. 26 First: Is Super Bowl matchup coming together? 1. Jason Garrett’s decision | 2. What’s decided, what’s not 3. Terry Bradshaw and Mike Tomlin  | 4. Giants offense 5. Broncos and Panthers  | 6. Hits on Cam Newton 7. No. 1 pick | 8. Marcus Mariota and Jameis Winston  9. Adam Gase’s success | 10. Vikes’ rebellion FIRST  …     After a holiday weekend of   results and   injuries, the NFL’s postseason picture has come pretty sharply into focus. The playoff field is taking shape and the serious Championship Contenders are being separated from Everyone Else. And the inescapable question at this point is: Is it all pointing toward a Super Bowl meeting in Houston between the Dallas Cowboys and New England Patriots? For now, at least, it certainly seems that way. The Cowboys secured the top seed in the NFC playoffs when the New York Giants lost Thursday night at Philadelphia. So now Coach Jason Garrett must figure out how to play things in his team’s two remaining regular season games, beginning Monday night against the Detroit Lions, with nothing at stake in the standings but plenty at stake in terms of readying for a   home playoff game. Does he put quarterback Dak Prescott, tailback Ezekiel Elliott and other key starters on the shelf or have the Cowboys keep their foot on the accelerator? If Garrett wanted to avoid thinking about what a key injury late in the regular season can do to a team’s playoff prospects, he needed to be far, far away from any source of NFL news over the weekend. The postseason outlook is far different for the Oakland Raiders after their quarterback and league MVP candidate, Derek Carr, suffered a broken fibula during Saturday’s victory over the Indianapolis Colts (hours after the Tennessee Titans’ brilliant   quarterback, Marcus Mariota, suffered a fractured fibula on the day his team was eliminated from the postseason).  Whatever Garrett does (more on that later) the Cowboys will be something between a   and overwhelming favorite entering the NFC playoffs. They will have a   bye and   advantage. And who is even the   team in the conference right now? The Giants have beaten the Cowboys twice this season. They limited the Cowboys and Lions to a total of 13 points in impressive    recent victories. But their successfully remade defense remains without pass rusher Jason   and was without standout cornerback Janoris Jenkins on Thursday. And the offense continues to be stuck in place. The Giants managed only 19 points against the Eagles with quarterback Eli Manning throwing the ball 63 times. They’ve gone four straight games without a   outing. The Lions? Their MVP candidate, quarterback Matthew Stafford, is playing with an injured middle finger on his throwing hand. The Seattle Seahawks? Some weeks they look great. Other weeks, they look like they did in Saturday’s loss to the Arizona Cardinals. The Atlanta Falcons or Green Bay Packers? Maybe on their best day and the Cowboys’ worst  —   if the Packers even reach the postseason, that is. The Patriots still have some work to do to secure the AFC’s No. 1 seed, with the Raiders on their heels. But Oakland now has Matt McGloin taking over for Carr at quarterback. The Houston Texans, champions of the AFC South, have Tom Savage at quarterback after at least temporarily giving up on $72 million man Brock Osweiler. The   Miami Dolphins have Matt Moore playing for the injured Ryan Tannehill. Who in the AFC would be capable of going to Foxborough, Mass. and keeping the Patriots from making a trip to Houston? Two of the AFC teams with the sturdiest defenses and the confidence generated by past successes against the Patriots, the Baltimore Ravens and Denver Broncos, were eliminated from the playoffs Sunday. The Pittsburgh Steelers are playing well, with six straight victories. They have a   Super Bowl winner at quarterback in Ben Roethlisberger, and a powerful and varied offense built around tailback Le’Veon Bell and wide receiver Antonio Brown. They are a clear threat. But would their pass defense hold up? The Kansas City Chiefs likewise are capable. But could their offense do enough? No, a   Super Bowl is not a certainty. But you have to like both teams’ chances at this point. And in a season in which the   decline in the sport’s television ratings was such a major issue, that matchup undoubtedly would draw a huge TV audience. The Cowboys have led the   viewership rebound for the NFL. The Patriots are the team that everybody either loves or loathes; either way, they watch. The NFL probably would not be terribly disappointed to see that come about.   …     AND TEN 1. Jason Garrett’s decision: It’s doubtful that the Cowboys coach will change anything Monday about playing time for his key players. That’s simply too long between meaningful games if the Cowboys shut things down for the final two regular season games, then have a   playoff bye before hosting an NFC semifinal. But it becomes interesting in the regular season finale to see if he will withhold certain players entirely or get them out of the game early. And if he does sit down Prescott at any point, does he go to Tony Romo? Romo has not played all season after suffering the back injury during the preseason that gave Prescott his chance. Maybe Garrett and Romo would like to knock some of the rust off Romo’s game. Or maybe they would opt to keep Romo safely on the sideline and figure that his   preparations are enough if he’s needed at any point. The Cowboys, after all, have Mark Sanchez on the roster if they decide to rest Prescott. 2. What’s decided, what’s not: The AFC playoff field is set after Sunday’s triumphs by the Steelers and Chiefs. It’ll be the Patriots, Raiders, Steelers, Texans, Chiefs and Miami Dolphins (not necessarily seeded in that order). In the NFC, the Cowboys are the top seed. The Seahawks have won the NFC West and the Falcons are champions of the NFC South. The Giants are in as a wild card. The Lions clinch a playoff spot if they win Monday night at Dallas. They and the Packers will play Sunday night in Detroit for the NFC North title. The Packers, for now, hold the second wild card spot. But the Washington Redskins remain very much in the running for the second wild card berth after their win Saturday at Chicago. There will be some things left to be decided on the final weekend of the regular season. 3. Terry Bradshaw and Mike Tomlin: Terry Bradshaw is a Hall of Fame quarterback and is a very good NFL studio analyst on Fox who is unafraid to express an opinion even when it is unflattering to some within the sport. That is a rare and refreshing quality in a former player. But his criticism of Steelers Coach Mike Tomlin was curious. Bradshaw dismissed Tomlin as being “a great cheerleader guy” but not, in Bradshaw’s view, a great coach.  This division title is Tomlin’s fifth in his 10 seasons as coach of the Steelers. He has taken the team to two Super Bowls and won one of them. Is that a coaching record on par with, say, Bill Belichick’s? No. But it is quite good. Tomlin clearly is doing something right, and that something is more than leading cheers. Perhaps he does not qualify as a “great” coach, depending on your definition of coaching greatness. But he’s certainly better than most, based on his accomplishments during a decade in Pittsburgh.  4. Giants offense: The Giants’ lack of offensive production is a problem. Their major offseason moves were on defense, and that has worked splendidly. But Manning was supposed to be better with another year in the offensive system of Ben McAdoo, the team’s former offensive coordinator turned   head coach. Instead, Manning is up to 16 interceptions for the season after throwing three of them against the Eagles. That’s up from 14 last season. His passer rating is down from 93. 6 last season to 86. 2 this season. Twice in Manning’s career, he and the Giants have made improbable postseason runs to Super Bowl wins over the Patriots. The Giants probably would need something similar from Manning if they’re going to be a factor in these NFC playoffs.  Wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr. said late Thursday night at Lincoln Financial Field that he remains confident the offense will get going. But the time for that, he acknowledged, has arrived. “I play offense,” Beckham said. “Of course I want to score 30 points. You know what I mean? But it hasn’t been the case. So we’re not gonna get frustrated. This isn’t gonna make or break who we are. If anything, I think it’ll make this team stronger. ” 5. Broncos and Panthers: The Broncos, the defending Super Bowl champs, were eliminated from the playoffs with Sunday night’s loss at Kansas City and had to suffer the   indignity of having Chiefs defensive tackle Dontari Poe line up on offense, take a direct snap and throw a touchdown pass against them.  The propriety of that maneuver by the Chiefs aside, it was a fitting ending to the competitive portion of the Broncos’ season. The Denver defense remained very good this season but this time, it wasn’t good enough to overcome the team’s offensive deficiencies. Going forward, the Broncos will have to decide if either Trevor Siemian or Paxton Lynch is the answer at quarterback. If not, would they make a move for Romo? (Putting in a call to Poe seems like a long shot.) The Broncos, with a record of   will at least finish at . 500 or above. Last season’s other Super Bowl team, the Carolina Panthers, is   and ensured of a losing season. The Carolina defense failed to deal with the inexplicable offseason decision by the team to cut ties with cornerback Josh Norman. Quarterback Cam Newton didn’t come close to duplicating his MVP season. It’s the first time that both Super Bowl participants have failed to reach the playoffs in the following season since the Raiders and Tampa Bay Buccaneers fell short in the 2003 season. 6. Hits on Cam Newton: The NFL did not fine the Redskins’ Trent Murphy last week for his hit on Newton as the Panthers quarterback was sliding at the end of a run during Carolina’s triumph last Monday night at FedEx Field. It says here that the   officials made a mistake when they didn’t penalize Murphy’s hit, and that the NFL doubled down on that mistake by not fining Murphy.  Murphy was permitted to hit Newton. He’d committed to that before Newton began his slide. But Murphy was not permitted, by rule, to hit Newton forcibly in the quarterback’s head. The   officials ruled that Newton hadn’t been hit forcibly in the head, and the league apparently agreed when it came to assessing a potential fine. But watch the replay. Newton certainly appeared to absorb forcible contact to the head. (Murphy’s hit did not have to be    to be illegal. Any forcible hit to Newton’s head under those circumstances is illegal.) It all gives credence to Newton’s complaints from earlier this season that he wasn’t being protected properly. That was a borderline call, you say? Perhaps. But what about the call in the same game in which Redskins quarterback Kirk Cousins appeared to be in bounds when he was hit and drew a penalty for a late hit out of bounds? What about Eagles rookie Carson Wentz drawing two borderline calls Thursday night? Why does Newton continue to be treated differently? 7. No. 1 pick: The Cleveland Browns avoided the second   season in NFL history by beating the San Diego Chargers on Saturday. But that victory gave the San Francisco 49ers an opening to “overtake” the Browns for the top overall selection in the NFL draft this spring.  Alas, these two teams do nothing right, it seems. The 49ers beat the Los Angeles Rams for their second victory of the season. So the Browns will wrap up the No. 1 pick if they lose their season finale to the Steelers. The Browns, 49ers and Jacksonville Jaguars, by the way, went a combined   Saturday. They’d been a combined   this season when the day began. 8. Marcus Mariota and Jameis Winston: The Titans were eliminated from playoff contention with their loss Saturday at Jacksonville and the Texans’ victory that night over the Cincinnati Bengals. The Titans’ defeat was particularly agonizing because it was accompanied by Mariota’s injury.  The Buccaneers remain in wild card contention in the NFC, but just barely. They almost certainly will be home for the playoffs in quarterback Jameis Winston’s second NFL season. Even so, it was a successful Year 2 in the league for both Mariota and Winston. They reaffirmed that they are productive NFL quarterbacks and they transformed their teams into contenders. No one should be surprised if the Titans and Buccaneers are solidly in the postseason a year from now. 9. Adam Gase’s success: Adam Gase, Miami’s   coach, has the Dolphins in the playoffs despite a   start to the season. The Dolphins have gone   since then, and Gase should receive at least some consideration for the NFL’s coach of the year award. He was considered a rising star in the coaching ranks when the Dolphins hired him following his successful stints in Denver and Chicago as an offensive coordinator. Gase quickly has demonstrated in South Florida that the great expectations for him as a head coach were justified. 10. Vikes’ rebellion: Does it really matter if Minnesota cornerbacks Xavier Rhodes and Terence Newman did their own thing and ignored the game plan for covering Green Bay wide receiver Jordy Nelson for an entire half Saturday, as initial portrayals seemed to suggest, or for only one defensive series, as ESPN reported Sunday?  Either way, it was a fairly remarkable breach of standard NFL protocol. It also was stunning how openly Coach Mike Zimmer and Rhodes discussed the matter in their postgame comments.

142489,217985,Obama administration is close to announcing measures to punish Russia for election interference,Washington Post,Ellen Nakashima,2016-12-27,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161228001451/https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/the-white-house-is-scrambling-for-a-way-to-punish-russian-hackers-via-sanctions/2016/12/27/0eee2fdc-c58f-11e6-85b5-76616a33048d_story.html
"," The Obama administration is close to announcing a series of measures to punish Russia for its interference in the 2016 presidential election, including economic sanctions and diplomatic censure, according to U. S. officials. The administration is still finalizing the details, which are also expected to include covert action that likely will involve cyber operations, the officials said. An announcement on the public elements of the response could come as early as this week. The sanctions part of the package culminates weeks of debate in the White House about how to revise an executive order from last year meant to give the president authority to respond to cyberattacks from overseas, but which did not originally cover efforts to influence the electoral system. The Obama administration last year rolled the order out to great fanfare as a way to punish and deter foreign hackers who harm the United States’ economic or national security.  The threat to use it last year helped wring a pledge out of China’s president that his country would cease hacking U. S. companies’ secrets to benefit Chinese firms.      (Jason   Washington Post)   But officials this fall concluded that it could not, as written, be used to punish the most significant   in recent memory against the United States  —   Russia’s hacking of Democratic organizations, targeting of state election systems and meddling in the presidential election. With the clock ticking, the White House is working on adapting the authority to punish the Russians, according to the officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. President Obama last week pledged there would be a response to Moscow’s interference in the U. S. elections. Russia had denied involvement in the hacking. One clear way to use the order against the Russian suspects would be to declare the electoral systems part of the “critical infrastructure” of the United States. Or it could be amended to clearly apply to the new threat  —   interfering in elections. Administration officials would also like to make it difficult for   Donald Trump to roll back any action they take. “Part of the goal here is to make sure that we have as much of the record public or communicated to Congress in a form that would be difficult to simply walk back,” said one senior administration official, who like others spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. Obama issued the executive order in April 2015, creating the sanctions tool as a way to hold accountable people who harm computer systems related to critical functions such as electricity generation or transportation or who gain a competitive advantage through cybertheft of commercial secrets.   President Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping attend a news conference in November 2014 in Beijing. (Feng   Images)  The order allows the government to freeze the assets in the United States of people overseas who have engaged in cyber acts that have threatened U. S. national security or financial stability. The sanctions would also block commercial transactions with the designated individuals and bar their entry into the country. But just a year later, a Russian military spy agency would hack into the Democratic National Committee and steal a trove of emails that were released a few months later on WikiLeaks, U. S. officials said. Other releases followed, including the hacked emails of Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman, John Podesta. “Fundamentally, it was a     event,” said Zachary Goldman, a sanctions and national security expert at New York University School of Law. And the 2015 executive order was not crafted to target hackers who steal emails and dump them on WikiLeaks or seek to disrupt an election. “It was an authority published at a particular time to address a particular set of problems,” he said. So officials “need to engage in some legal acrobatics to fit the DNC hack into an existing authority, or they need to write a new authority,” Goldman said. Administration officials would like Obama to use the power before leaving office to demonstrate its utility. “When the president came into office, he didn’t have that many tools out there to use as a response” to malicious   said Ari Schwartz, a former senior director for cybersecurity on the National Security Council. “Having the sanctions tool is really a big one. It can make a very strong statement in a way that is less drastic than bombing a country and more impactful than sending out a cable from the State Department. ” The National Security Council concluded that it would not be able to use the authority against Russian hackers because their malicious activity did not clearly fit under its terms, which require harm to critical infrastructure or the theft of commercial secrets. “You would (a) have to be able to say that the actual electoral infrastructure, such as state databases, was critical infrastructure, and (b) that what the Russians did actually harmed it,” said the administration official who spoke on the condition of anonymity. “Those are two high bars. ” Though Russian government hackers are believed to have penetrated at least one state   database, they did not tamper with the data, officials said. Some analysts believe that state election systems would fit under “government facilities,” which is one of the 16 critical infrastructure sectors designated by the Department of Homeland Security. Another option is to use the executive order against other Russian targets  —   say, hackers who stole commercial secrets  —   and then, in either a public message or a private one, make clear that the United States considers its electoral systems to be critical infrastructure. The idea is to not only punish but also deter. “As much as I am concerned about what happened to us in the election, I am also concerned about what will happen to us in the future,” a second official said. “I am firmly convinced that the Russians and others will say, ‘That worked pretty well in 2016, so let’s keep going.’ We have elections every two years in this country. ” Even the threat of sanctions can have deterrent value. Officials and experts point to the agreement Chinese President Xi Jinping reached with Obama last year that his country would stop commercial cyberspying. Xi came to the table following news reports last summer that the administration was preparing to sanction Chinese companies. Complicating matters, the Trump transition team has not yet had extensive briefings with the White House on cyber issues, including the potential use of the   order. The slow pace has caused consternation among officials, who fear that the administration’s accomplishments in cybersecurity could languish if the next administration fails to understand their value.  Sanctions are not a silver bullet. Obama noted that “we already have enormous numbers of sanctions against the Russians” for their activities in Ukraine. So it is questionable, some experts say, whether adding new ones would have a meaningful effect in changing the Kremlin’s behavior. But in combination with other measures, they could be effective. Criminal indictments of Russians might become an option, officials said, but the FBI has so far not gathered enough evidence that could be introduced in a criminal case. At one point, federal prosecutors and FBI agents in San Francisco considered indicting Guccifer 2. 0, a nickname for a person or people believed to be affiliated with the Russian influence operation and whose true identity was unknown. Before the election, the administration used diplomatic channels to warn Russia. Obama spoke to Russian President Vladi mir Putin at a Group of 20 summit in China in September. About a week before the election, the United States sent a “hotline”  message to Moscow using a special channel for crisis communication created in 2013 as part of the State Department’s Nuclear Risk Reduction Center. As part of that message, the officials said, the administration asked Russia to stop targeting state voter registration and election systems. It was the first use of that system. The Russians, officials said, appeared to comply.     "

","   Donald Trump took to Twitter on Monday night to defend the charitable foundation he has pledged to close, saying the media had not given him enough credit for his generosity and ignoring the legal issues that have ensnared the organization in controversy. The Donald J. Trump Foundation has come under intense scrutiny this year after reports in The Washington Post detailing its practices, including cases in which Trump apparently used the charity’s money to settle lawsuits involving his   businesses.  New York’s attorney general is investigating the charity, and a spokeswoman for that office said Saturday that the foundation could not officially shut down until that probe is over. Among the issues at hand is whether Trump violated a “ ” provision that says nonprofit leaders cannot use their charities’ funds to help themselves, their relatives or their businesses. “I gave millions of dollars to DJT Foundation, raised or recieved millions more, ALL of which is given to charity, and media won’t report!” Trump said in one Monday night tweet.      (Victoria Walker, Peter   Washington Post)   “The DJT Foundation, unlike most foundations, never paid fees, rent, salaries or any expenses. 100% of money goes to wonderful charities!” the   said in another. Trump and his companies gave about $6 million to his foundation since its launch in 1987, according to tax filings. The most recent tax filings go up to the end of 2015. Other people have collectively given about $9. 5 million. The biggest outside donors were Vince and Linda McMahon, two   moguls, who gave the Trump Foundation $5 million between 2007 and 2009. Trump recently nominated Linda McMahon to head the Small Business Administration. Trump himself gave nothing to his foundation between 2009 and 2014, according to filings. His businesses contributed in 2015 for the first time in several years.  Experts on charities say it’s rare for the founder of a private,   foundation to give nothing to his own foundation while relying entirely on donations from others. That anomaly allowed Trump to take advantage of the idea that the money in the foundation was his. Trump’s donations to his foundation are also small, by the standards of billionaires’ philanthropy.             Caption   The men and women the   has selected for his Cabinet and White House team.

","     Donald Trump’s depiction of the state of the American economy has consistently been as bleak as it is subjective. The unemployment numbers are fictional, he’s claimed, with the real number perhaps as high as 42 percent! (It isn’t anywhere close.) President Obama’s never achieved 3 percent growth in a year, a first for a modern president! (True when you look at calendar years and presidents after Herbert Hoover.) But Americans don’t often take the big picture view on the economy, either. How the country is faring economically is as subjective for us as it seems to be for Trump. Setting up a   question: When Trump’s depiction of the Trump economy turns suddenly sunny, will America agree? That process began Monday evening, with another tweet from the  .   The world was gloomy before I won   there was no hope. Now the market is up nearly 10% and Christmas spending is over a trillion dollars!  —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 26, 2016   There are three economic indicators in that tweet, by our estimation: economic confidence (the measure of hope, if you will) the Dow Jones industrial average and holiday spending. (Why “holiday” vs. “Christmas”? We’ll get to that, but it’s not because we’ve declared war on the Christian holiday.) Here’s how those numbers look. Economic confidence spiked after the election of Trump, according to data from Gallup. The effect is pretty remarkable, in fact.     What’s going on here? Last month, Gallup explained the switch in one simple word: partisanship. “Republicans and   independents now have a much more optimistic view of the U. S. economy’s outlook than they did before the election,” Gallup’s Justin McCarthy and Jeffrey M. Jones wrote. “Just 16% of Republicans said the economy was getting better in the week before the election, while 81% said it was getting worse. Since the election, 49% say it is getting better and 44% worse. ” Put another way: More than 8 in 10 Republicans were pessimistic about the economy before the election  —   but immediately after, more were optimistic than pessimistic.     The hope, in other words, had a partisan tinge, just like everything else. The Dow Jones industrial average reflects confidence, too. Trump’s right that the index is up nearly 10 percent since Election Day. We looked at this surge earlier this month, putting it into historical context. It matches the   surges enjoyed by Calvin Coolidge and Herbert Hoover (the president whose tenure overlapped with the Great Depression, meaning he, too, failed to hit Trump’s arbitrary    metric).     The Dow has been flirting with the symbolic   mark for some time; if it’s surpassed, expect another Trump tweet. How much credit is due to Trump for the increase isn’t entirely clear. The Dow is up 16 percent since the beginning of the year. At the end of March, relative to a     prior, the index was up 12. 9 percent. Since Obama was elected in 2008, the Dow is up 107 percent  —   more than double  —   but he isn’t usually described as the cause of that growth. What’s more, Trump is setting up a risky connection: If the Dow does well thanks to him, what happens if and when it tanks? Last week, CNN Money reported that Trump probably deserves some credit for the improved Dow in the sense that a quarter of the spike is a function of Goldman Sachs’s improvement. Goldman’s up nearly a third since Election Day, an improvement that overlaps with Trump tapping its president and several alumni for posts in his administration. The credit Trump claims for holiday spending, though, is far less due. The number he cites  —   a trillion dollars  —   appears to come from a Deloitte survey that projected holiday sales from November through January and reached that   number. Mind you, that survey was released in October, meaning that the projections had nothing to do with a Trump electoral win. Deloitte instead credited better household finances and the steadily improving economy for the figure. In fact, Deloitte’s numbers specifically indicate that   of Americans didn’t expect the presidential election to affect their spending at all.     That tweet, though, offers another taste of what we can expect from President Trump, once he’s inaugurated. Just as he railed against government figures during the campaign, we can expect him to isolate and exaggerate good economic news once he’s in office. (Or, apparently, even before.) This isn’t unique to Trump, of course; politicians, including Obama, aren’t shy about highlighting the positives and downplaying the negatives. What makes Trump different is scale: His willingness to take credit or assign blame tends toward the extremes. In an article at Politico, AEI’s James Pethokoukis neatly summarizes what President Trump’s economic pronouncements might be like. “The   judges his own personal wealth based on his own feelings,” he said, referring to a comment Trump once made in a deposition. “So on any given day, he could just decide based on his feelings that America is great. ” The catch? If voters aren’t convinced by November 2020  —   if their subjective analysis of the economy doesn’t match Trump’s rhetoric  —   he’s in for an awfully tough reelection."

"," “I was born famous,” Carrie Fisher said. The daughter of two of Hollywood’s biggest stars of the 1950s  —   actress Debbie Reynolds and singer Eddie Fisher  —   she would lead a life of inescapable fame, and the privilege and chaos that came with it. She became a celebrity in her own right, playing the heroic Princess Leia in the blockbuster 1977 film “Star Wars” and two sequels in the 1980s. She was only 19  —   and the principal female character  —   when she filmed the first in the George Lucas   series that has become a cultural touchstone.  The “Star Wars” enterprise became a universe of its own, spawning six sequels (so far) and legions of devoted fans who examined every line of dialogue  —   and every change of Ms. Fisher’s sometimes revealing costumes  —   for esoteric meaning.  Ms. Fisher appeared in dozens of other films and television shows, but Princess Leia would remain the role of a lifetime.

"," ‘Some crappy dessert. Anything. I’ll take it all. ” That was Carrie Fisher ordering a midafternoon snack at the Cannes Film Festival in May, where she was doing interviews for “Bright Lights: Starring Carrie Fisher and Debbie Reynolds,” a documentary about her mother, Debbie Reynolds; Fisher confided that she’d wanted to make the film for the past few years because, as she explained, “my mother had been sort of declining, and I didn’t know how much longer she would be performing. ”  In a cruel, cosmic twist Fisher herself would no doubt appreciate with her distinctive brand of gallows humor, she wound up going first  —   ahead of the mother whose   gifts (  ) and marriage to Eddie Fisher catapulted Carrie into fame that never seemed to fit her entirely comfortably. She went into the family business as an actress, vaulting from   Hollywood royalty to the   version as a generation’s most revered space princess, along the way picking up and dropping a drug habit, turning it all into fodder for one of the finest, funniest   memoirs ever written, albeit in the form of a   novel. Movie fans may consider “Postcards From the Edge” a piquant Meryl Streep comedy, but writers worship the book for the same tough, wry   Fisher brought to her   work (including uncredited improvements to the dialogue in “The Empire Strikes Back” and other “Star Wars” sequels) her   show, “Wishful Drinking,” and her actual memoir, the   “The Princess Diarist. ”         Approaching the nearly deserted hotel dining room where Fisher was holding court at Cannes, a certain amount of anxiety was in order. She was, after all, a bona fide icon whose contribution to “Star Wars” and its mythic status cannot be overstated, if only because her version of a princess was so subversively, sarcastically salty. She was also   armed with a   b. s. detector and a lethally barbed verbal arsenal with which to enforce it.  Happily enough, Carrie Fisher turned out to be, not an Important Figure or Towering Intellect but, of all things, a person  —   whose mix of forthrightness and humor were on full, disarming display as she nibbled at a plate of petits fours and shared a dish of vanilla ice cream with her beloved French bulldog, Gary. (The two had been the hit of the red carpet at the White House correspondents’ dinner just a few weeks earlier. “He’s changed,” she said of the attention. “It’s gone straight to his tail. ”). Although she looked terrific  —   if exhausted  —   she didn’t hesitate to share the mortification of confronting her aging face and body on a   screen, in both “Bright Lights” and, a few months earlier, in “The Force Awakens. ” “I see it and I suffer, and then I see it again, and I’m sort of able to watch it,” she said, admitting that it was never easy to watch herself on the big screen, “but now it’s just ridiculous. ” Last week, after seeing her 1977 “Star Wars” persona briefly come back to life in the new spinoff “Rogue One,” she tweeted, “cgi me . . . like   only more persistent,” spelled by way of her own private language of emoji hieroglyphics.  Back at Cannes, even within the necessary confines of a rushed   interview, Fisher displayed what made her so distinctive as an actress and a writer: her honesty. No sooner had she ordered her “crappy dessert” than she launched into a monologue about how ice cream and peanut butter help manage bouts of depression. Although she was diagnosed with bipolar disorder more than a decade ago, “I don’t get depressed that much,” she confided, adding that “I think it’s important not to look for those things. So I don’t. ” Fisher eagerly recounted how she advocated for electroconvulsive therapy after having been helped by the treatment. “It has such a bad rap,” she said, “because it’s used as a technique of torture in every Hollywood movie in which it’s ever been depicted. There’s no shame in it, but there is shame in it. And part of me, I guess, likes to be sort of shocking. ” Fisher will be duly remembered for her wit, her intelligence, her acerbic   and her status as a   legend in one of the most pivotal films of the late 20th century (and beyond). But it’s her willingness to bring lucid, sometimes lacerating candor to even her most private struggles that will be her most meaningful legacy. “The great thing about it is when a    comes up and says, ‘I found out I was bipolar, and my mom told me that Princess Leia is bipolar as well,’ ” Fisher said, adding that “anyone who has this illness is heroic. ” Leave it to Fisher to have embodied that principle literally, figuratively and, now, forever more.

","     FROM THE very beginning, George Lucas knew he had a life force of a young actress on his hands. When first casting his “Star Wars” films,   Lucas seriously considered such other budding teenage talents as Jodie Foster and Terri Nunn. Yet Carrie Fisher, still barely an adult at the time, had a silly,   presence that melded well with future   Mark Hamill and Harrison Ford during auditions. She also had a precocious sense of self  —   a quick mind and a feisty steeliness of spine. In short, Fisher reminded Lucas of his own younger sister. The combination would prove to be perfect for her role as Princess Leia, the iconic character for which she would become most known. “Fisher had a wicked sense of humor and a foul mouth  —   fueled at times by a drug habit she managed to keep mostly hidden  —   and she had no trouble at all playing a   princess,” Brian Jay Jones wrote in his new biography, “George Lucas: A Life. ” Everything about Fisher, in fact, seemed irrepressible on set, from her blunt honesty to her physical vitality. “Lucas didn’t want her looking too aggressively feminine, using gaffer’s tape to hold down her breasts,” wrote Jones, who quoted Fisher’s memories of that time: “No breasts bounce in space, no jiggling in the Empire,” Fisher snickered, as quoted in Jones’s book. “[Producer] Gary Kurtz had to tell me that. George didn’t have the nerve. ” (Later in the original trilogy, of course, Lucas would pivot on that sexuality, costuming Fisher in the infamous   bikini as a slave of Jabba the Hutt. Fisher would recount personal anecdotes from those scenes in her wonderful   show “Wishful Drinking. ”) Yet as much joy and swagger as Fisher embodied during filming, she was still a green actress who had only recently had a bit role in “Shampoo” (in which her character memorably flirts and sleeps with the considerably older hairdresser played by Warren Beatty). At 19, insecurities plagued her. “She never felt she was pretty enough, disliked her earmuff hairstyle, couldn’t decide what accent she should be using, and fretted about dropping her prop gun during her swing over a chasm with Hamill  —   but also worried that if she expressed any displeasure or discomfort, she would be replaced by Jodie Foster or any of the countless other actresses had rejected for the role,” Jones wrote of Fisher, who, though already quite lithe, was told to lose 10 pounds for the role.      Look back at the life and accomplishments of the   author and ”Star Wars” actress. (Gillian Brockell, Daron   Washington Post)   As Fisher recently revealed in her memoir “The Princess Diarist,” she found comfort and reassurance in beginning a steamy affair with the   Ford (who portrayed Han Solo) who was in his early 30s. Last year, Fisher and Ford reunited on screen, as estranged parents of a son who has gone to the dark side in the blockbuster smash “Star Wars: The Force Awakens. ” Portraying Gen. Leia Organa, Fisher was again subjected to the double standard of harsher body scrutiny for women, both in Hollywood and on social media. Yet Fisher owned the occasion, marrying her characteristic winning honesty and beautifully blunt wit with the gravitas of   wisdom. On press tours for the film, she quipped. She championed. And as always, she charmed. We, in other words, got to fall in love with Carrie Fisher’s crucial attachment to Star Wars all over again. She long had a   relationship with the Leia role, yet she spoke often of accepting all the good that the role brought her. Carrie Fisher died Tuesday in Los Angeles, shortly after a massive heart attack. She was 60. And she was beloved, by   and fans alike the globe over.   no words #Devastated pic. twitter.   —   Mark Hamill (@HamillHimself) December 27, 2016     I thought I had got what I wanted under the tree.

","  The Israeli government stepped up its running battle with the Obama administration on Tuesday, saying it had proof that the United States had orchestrated a U. N. Security Council resolution condemning settlement activity. “We have ironclad information that emanates from sources in the Arab world and that shows the Obama administration helped craft this resolution and pushed hard for its eventual passage,”  David Keyes, a spokesman for  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, told reporters. “We’re not just going to be a punching bag and go quietly into the night. ” State Department deputy spokesman Mark Toner denied that the administration had “precooked” the resolution. But the U. S. explanation did little to quell fears in Israel that another Security Council censure may be forthcoming, even though U. S. officials insisted that no more U. N. resolutions are expected. Toner said the United States had abstained, allowing passage of the resolution, because it was “balanced”  —   it also condemns Palestinian incitement to violence and terrorism  —   and because there was growing concern that increased settlement activity was imperiling a   solution. “This was a resolution that we could not in good conscience veto, because it condemns violence. It condemned incitement,” Toner said. “It reiterates what has long been the overwhelming consensus internationally [on settlements] and it calls for the parties to take constructive steps to advance a   solution on the ground. There was nothing in there that would prompt us to veto that kind of resolution. ”      (Reuters)    The Israeli allegation of U. S. collusion in the resolution appears to be linked to meetings Secretary of State John F. Kerry had in recent months with Palestinian and Egyptian diplomats and officials from resolution   New Zealand, where Kerry stopped last month en route to Antarctica. State Department officials said no specific language was discussed. “There is no truth to the notion that we discussed the text of any resolution or that we previewed any position we might take on a hypothetical resolution in those meetings,” said a senior State Department official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to comment on the private meetings. Amid acrid bitterness in Israel over what is seen as the United States’ failure to protect Israel in not using its veto, Kerry is returning to Washington from vacation to give a speech Wednesday  morning outlining his vision for resolving the conflict between the  Israelis and Palestinians.  There will be an     undertone to his remarks. With less than a month left before President Obama leaves office,   Donald Trump has vowed that the U. S.  relationship will be markedly different.  But there appeared to be little chance that the Israeli government would heed the “  call” Toner said he hoped the U. N. resolution would sound for Israel and curtail settlement activity. Israeli officials pressed ahead, preparing to approve construction permits Wednesday to build 600 new homes in East Jerusalem, which came under Israeli control after the 1967 war. Since Friday’s vote, Netanyahu has summoned diplomats from countries that voted for the resolution and recalled Israel’s ambassadors in New Zealand and Senegal, two of the four countries that sponsored the resolution. Some   members of Netanyahu’s coalition have called on him to ramp up settlement construction and have said Israel should annex parts of the West Bank. Meanwhile, new details started to emerge about the    diplomatic scramble that preceded the resolution  —    approved by a vote of 14 to 0  —   declaring that Israel’s settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem have “no legal validity” and are a “flagrant violation under international law. ” It calls the settlements an obstacle to achieving a   solution and peace with the Palestinians. A diplomat from a Security Council nation, speaking on the condition of anonymity, largely backed up the Obama administration’s account that it played no role in bringing the resolution to a vote. It had been discussed among Security Council members for months, but the U. S. position was well known. The United States never told anyone how it would vote, not even in a consultation room where the 15 members of the Security Council gathered before they filed in to vote, according to the diplomat. The U. S. officials in attendance said they were still in “consultations” over the resolution, the diplomat said. In Israel, the newspaper Haaretz reported that Britain, not the United States, appears to have been the driving force behind the resolution after Egypt, which had initially sponsored the resolution, withdrew. It described Netanyahu being sharp and caustic in a phone call to New Zealand’s foreign minister, Murray McCully, calling the resolution “a declaration of war. ” Haaretz said that Netanyahu vowed to recall Israel’s ambassador to New Zealand but that McCully rebuffed the threat. The report said that after Egypt backed down, Palestinian and Arab Persian Gulf diplomats urged the four   nations to move on with the resolution anyway. The message was driven home by Britain, which had worked directly with the Palestinians on drafting the language. A   glitch came up when Russia’s ambassador to the United Nations, Vitaly Churkin, proposed postponing the vote until after Christmas, according to an interview the deputy Russian ambassador to Israel gave on Israel Army Radio. This reportedly followed a phone call between Netanyahu and Russian President Vladi mir Putin. The other Security Council ambassadors refused to wait, however.       Eglash reported from Jerusalem. "
142496,217992,Our country is bitterly divided. How ’bout a little small talk?,Washington Post,Garrison Keillor,2016-12-27,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161228001451/https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/our-country-is-bitterly-divided-how-bout-a-little-small-talk/2016/12/27/1b8a26d2-cc7a-11e6-a87f-b917067331bb_story.html
","   Garrison Keillor is an author and radio personality.   A man says to me, “How do you like that car?” I’m standing by a little green Kia. “It’s not mine, it’s a rental,” I say. I’m in the town of Okeechobee, Fla. parked on the main drag in front of Nutmeg’s Cafe. “Where you from?” he says.  “Minnesota. ” “I hear they just got more snow up there. ”  “How do you like that car?” is a classic opening of a casual conversation between two men who don’t know each other and it can lead in various directions, if they have the urge to talk. He’s from Connecticut, I find out, and has lived in nearby Fort Pierce for several years. He thought when he moved to Florida that he’d be spending a lot of time on beaches but he hasn’t been on a beach much at all. He drives a 1947 Packard convertible that he fixed up himself. He moved here because Florida is better for the Packard and also to see to his father, who is 87, and also to get away from a broken romance. He and his dad have breakfast together every Thursday morning. He misses the North, the big winter storms, the bracing chill in the air, but Florida is okay. He is thinking of buying property in Okeechobee. He likes small towns. He recommends I see Fort Pierce and drive the Indian River highway down the coast. He offers all of this in one brief encounter standing on the sidewalk, and when we say so long, I have no idea what his politics are, if he attends church, what he does for a living, how he feels about climate change, but I do feel warmly about Okeechobee. These common social moments aren’t as common as they used to be. For one thing, so many people wear headphones and you’d have to tap them on the shoulder and have something serious to say, like “Your pants are on fire. ” An older man avoids striking up a conversation with a younger woman for fear it will be misconstrued, or with younger men because their default response is “Hnnph. ” You stand in line at a store counter, people are busy texting, Googling on their phones, checking their inboxes, and you hesitate to say, “Beautiful weather we’re having. ” Or “Those are   boots you’re wearing. ” Or “How do you like that car?” I hitchhiked a lot in my teens and remember the men who gave me a lift and how talkative they were. I was a shy kid, so older people opened up to me. It was a hitchhiker’s job to shut up and listen: That was how you paid for the ride. They complained about their jobs, talked about the war, gave you advice about women and life. But nobody hitchhikes anymore, and thanks to the universality of gizmos, small talk has become rare, and a person comes to feel he’s living in a hostile world, which is not true at all. When I lived in Denmark, small talk with a stranger was the hardest language to get a handle on  —   the big declarative textbook sentences don’t work in that context  —   so much is conveyed by tone, by harrumph and sigh and nonsense sounds, the Danish equivalents of “oy” and “uff da” and “yikes. ” Flying back to New York and walking through JFK, I felt immersed in small talk, like a sea lion returning to the herd. My dad loved Florida. His Minnesota life was constrained by family and church and job, and in Florida he went into business as an itinerant   working a long route of restaurants, meeting strangers, making small talk, which he dearly loved. He was a Christian fundamentalist, bound by strict doctrine, but on the knife route, he could talk about weather, children, sports, cars, without reference to the Rapture and the Millennium. It was the freedom to be ordinary. The Indian River highway was a disappointment: a   road along a solid phalanx of mansions behind gates and no place to stop and admire the Atlantic. But the conversation with the guy curious about the green Kia was memorable. Two weeks have passed since, and I haven’t had another encounter like it. They say the country is bitterly divided. Maybe so, but that’s no reason to be rude. My mailman likes to banter, and so do the guys at Lloyd’s Automotive and the cabdrivers. So what’s going on with you? Cat got your tongue? Where’d you get that sweater? What’s that product you put on your hair?

","     Until Carrie Fisher, “princess” was a dirty word. Before “Star Wars,” I had seen princesses. I was a little girl, and when you are a little girl, all anyone seems to want to do is to show you princesses to emulate. I wanted no part of it. Princesses were things who got rescued. Princesses wore pink. Princesses sat in castles waiting for their dragons to go off duty and their knights in shining armor to come to the rescue. Princesses were dreamy and spoke softly and little birds alighted on their arms and they brushed out their long golden hair and sang and they didn’t crack jokes and they didn’t get frustrated and they most certainly didn’t take matters into their own hands and rescue themselves. And then I saw “Star Wars,” and Princess Leia, and suddenly “princess” meant something altogether different. She was not an object to be rescued. She was someone we saw from the inside. “Aren’t you a little short for a stormtrooper?” Princess Leia asks her   rescuer. “I’m Luke Skywalker,” he announces. “I’m here to rescue you. ” “You’re who?” In a few moments, she is the only one with a plan, leading everyone to temporary safety in a garbage chute. (“Somebody,” she notes, “has to save our skins. ”) Birds don’t land on her arms. She doesn’t sing (except on “SNL” and in the Christmas special, of which the less said, the better). She doesn’t take guff. She is, in short, a real,   person, a survivor, capable, smart and worthy of love. But Carrie Fisher, whom we lost Tuesday, was so much more than just Princess Leia (or even General Organa). What made Carrie Fisher such a wonderful presence was that hers was a writer’s mind dropped in the midst of a fascinating story. Born showbiz royalty as the daughter of Debbie Reynolds and Eddie Fisher (who left Reynolds for Elizabeth Taylor and “basically fled the scene of the accident,” as Carrie Fisher quipped) she wound up starring in perhaps the biggest film franchise of all time. She had a life few people on Earth could imagine  —   until she wrote about it, and then you were right there, seeing it all and laughing with her. She was a novelist  —   her “Postcards From the Edge,” which drew on her own experience in a showbiz family, brimmed with wit and became a movie starring Meryl Streep and Shirley MacLaine  —   and a memoirist and a raconteur, and her greatest gift was sharing the wild ride she was on with anyone who cared to listen.      Look back at the life and accomplishments of the   author and ”Star Wars” actress. (Gillian Brockell, Daron   Washington Post)   You could always tell there was a real human being in there beneath the silly space hair  —   one with a sharp wit and an observer’s eye. She did not take fame seriously, and through her writings demystified it, often hilariously. She shared too, with warmth and courage, her experiences of loss and mental illness. Her life was an open book, and it was fantastically  . Her   account, from “Wishful Drinking,” of why George Lucas wouldn’t let her wear a bra remains one of the funniest things ever. (“George came up to me the first day of filming, took one look at the dress and said: ‘You can’t wear a bra under that dress.’ ‘OK, I’ll bite,’ I said. ‘Why?’ And he said: ‘Because   …     there’s no underwear in space.’ He said it with such conviction. Like he had been to space and looked around and he didn’t see any bras or panties anywhere. He explained, ‘You go into space and you become weightless. Then your body expands but your bra doesn’t, so you get strangled by your own underwear.’ I think that this would make a fantastic obituary. I tell my younger friends that no matter how I go, I want it reported that I drowned in moonlight, strangled by my own bra. ”) And she imbued Leia with these qualities, too. Leia is not just an amazing female character but a great character, full stop: strong and vulnerable and funny and kind, with causes she is willing to fight for  —   with a blaster or even a spear if necessary. A lot of what I know about how to be a person in the world I learned from Princess Leia  —   and, when I got old enough to separate the actress from the character, from Carrie Fisher herself. Both had a remarkable gift for cutting through nonsense. Fisher poked fun at her own performance and Leia’s “viral” faux British accent that “came and went. ” She wielded a wit like Dorothy Parker’s, with the same gift for the piercing phrase (“Instant gratification takes too long”) and the apt pun  —   she described the experience of a manic episode as “I was trapped in a metaphor. Everything I looked at had a meaning. Everything was a warning or a sign.   …     ‘Metaphors be with you.’ ” Carrie’s account of how Leia got into the infamous gold bikini is: “A giant slug captured me and forced me to wear that stupid outfit, and then I killed him because I didn’t like it. ” That’s about right. She gave Leia a voice of her own that extended even past the movies, one that was observant and tart and full of life. She didn’t exist as a love interest or a sex object. She was her own person, and she would strangle Jabba the Hutt herself for making her wear that awful bikini, thank you very much. As Fisher told the audience at the Hay Festival, “I had a lot of fun killing Jabba the Hutt. They asked me on the day if I wanted to have a stunt double kill Jabba. No! That’s the best time I ever had as an actor. And the only reason to go into acting is if you can kill a giant monster. ” The inadvertent high priestess of the “Star Wars” cult, she was always cracking wise about her peculiar position as merchandise, sex symbol and mother figure to generations of fans. (“I liked being a shampoo where you twist of my head and pour liquid out of my head   …     I’ve been licked like a stamp. I’ve been a robe. ”) She knew it was ridiculous. And she let us in on the joke. And we loved her for it. “You feel like a camp reunion,” she quipped of “The Force Awakens,” “only Harrison and I look a little melted.’ ” “Han and I had a volatile relationship,” she joked.  “We have space estrangement. We had a child who turned out to be Hitler. ” What a void her voice will leave. The one consolation is that losing a celebrity is always different from losing a real person. The way you know a famous person during their lifetime is not so different from the celluloid cenotaph they leave for you after death: the record of a life scrawled in light on a dark screen, the words on a page that peered into your life and made you laugh, even while your heart was breaking."

","  Spare us the  . ? It was June 2001 and I was covering President George W. Bush s trip to Slovenia, where he had just met Vladimir Putin for the first time. I and others were struck by Bush s praise for the Russian leader as  trustworthy. ? Said Bush:  I was able to get a sense of his soul. ?  But back in Washington, my editor had no interest in such talk. He rewrote my lede with other news  ” a tidbit about missile defense  ” and he moved the    ? stuff about Putin s soul down to Paragraph 18.  In retrospect, that moment in Slovenia defined the Russia relationship for years to come. Putin had seduced Bush, who only slowly came to understand he had misjudged this adversary s soul. Putin opposed Bush in Iraq and was unhelpful with Iran. He shut down independent television, sent business leaders who criticized him into exile and prison, ousted democratic parties from government, canceled the election of governors and invaded Georgia.  The   happened all over again when President Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton tried to  reset ? relations. Russia responded by working against the United States in Syria, sheltering Edward Snowden, invading and occupying parts of Ukraine, and hacking and meddling in the U. S. election to defeat Clinton.  Now it s Donald Trump s turn for   and the   is practically groping the Russian dictator. After Putin gloated Friday that Democrats need to learn  to lose with dignity, ? Trump tweeted Putin a sloppy kiss:  So true! ? he said of Putin s comments. Trump also celebrated a letter he received from Putin calling for more collaboration between the two countries.  His thoughts are so correct, ? Trump said. Trump s   embrace of the strongman has included repeated praise of Putin s leadership, deflected questions about Putin s political killings and disparagement of U. S. intelligence for accusing Russia of election meddling.  In three weeks, Trump will assume the presidency, and we ll learn what his embrace of Putin really means. Perhaps Trump is just a dupe and he ll realize over time that Putin is no friend. The alternative, supported by Trump s choice of   advisers Michael T. Flynn and Rex Tillerson, is that Trump really is   and will grant the Russian dictator more latitude internationally and will emulate his autocratic tendencies at home.  The former would require us to endure some policy failures as Putin proved himself again to be an adversary. The latter would test the limits of our democratic institutions.  In either case, it would be useful for Americans to have at least a cursory sense of the man our new president proposes to embrace. Here s a quick glimpse into Putin s soul to get us started:  Opposition leader Boris Nemtsov was killed outside the Kremlin as he walked home one night last year. Putin s regime blames Chechens, but Nemtsov s is one of a dozen   murders of opponents widely thought to have been sanctioned by Putin s government. Another Putin opponent, Alexander Litvinenko, was killed in London by polonium poisoning in 2006. The British government said Putin  probably ? approved the hit. That same year, opposition journalist Anna Politkovskaya was shot and killed outside her apartment.  In 2009, lawyer Sergei Magnitsky died in prison after being denied medical care. Others working on his investigation of corrupt Russian politicians also died suspiciously.  Among the many business leaders imprisoned or ousted under Putin are Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who was head of the oil giant Yukos, and associate Platon Lebedev. The Russian human rights group Memorial says there are 102 people held in Russian prisons for their political or religious beliefs.  The Kremlin has provided funding and training for   nationalist parties in Europe, and it used its state media and an army of hackers and   trolls to spread disinformation in the United States, in continental Europe and in Britain before the Brexit vote. The goals: to weaken European unity and the NATO alliance and to keep Europe dependent on Russian energy. Russia also used disinformation to destabilize the Ukrainian government as Russia annexed Crimea. In Syria, where Russia propped up the Assad regime with indiscriminate bombing in Aleppo and elsewhere, Britain, France and the United States have blamed Putin s government for the mass slaughter of civilians.  An Amnesty International summary of Putin s rule leaves no doubt about his totalitarian state:  Journalist Killed . ‰. ‰. Human Rights Lawyer Killed . ‰. ‰. Gay Rights Protesters Attacked . ‰. ‰.

","       Donald Trump won the hearts of Rust Belt   whites by giving voice to their anger and giving them a comforting but utterly false narrative to explain their plight. He blamed “globalism” or “foreigners” or China or stupid Washington insiders or bungled trade deals for the   of the heartland and for their fall from the comfortable middle class to the bitter life of   hourly laborers. This was and continues to be a great disservice to Trump’s base, one promoted by supposedly “sophisticated” conservatives who have bought into the   and   narratives. Ironically, it used to be the Republican Party that called for personal initiative and derided  . Now, it is practically unheard of to hear Trump Republicans ask what responsibility the angry, white working class has for its status. Michael R. Strain of the American Enterprise Institute provides a necessary corrective. He bluntly writes:  “Members of the working class are not solely the victims of economic change and inadequate public policy. They themselves bear some of the responsibility for the frustration and anger they feel. They have agency. The degree to which our public conversation after the election has implicitly denied this basic fact has been concerning. ” He suggests that the cultural norm favoring work has eroded and that public policies should encourage, if not insist upon, work for   individuals: We should increase earnings subsidies. By subsidizing labor market earnings, policy can help a paycheck go further, and can pull people into participating in the workforce who otherwise would not in light of the wages they can command in today’s economy. Policy should help workers build skills that businesses actually demand and that the market will reward. Apprenticeships are a particularly promising option. Policy should get government out of the way by deregulating the labor market, creating more opportunity. And policies with significant unintended consequences that suppress workforce participation  —   like disability insurance  —   need to be reformed. Let’s take that a step further. This is not merely a binary choice: Work or not work. The issue is what we expect workers displaced or never prepared for the 21st century to do in order to work. The inspiring, recently released movie “Hidden Figures” tells the story of three African American women who overcame all manner of adversity during the Jim Crow era and beyond to excel at NASA and become contributors to the American space program. It is at bottom a tale of persistence and initiative. (The book on which it is based delves into the backstory of the women, providing rich details to illustrate each heroic journey.) And there is a message here for those who feel they have gotten the short end of the stick. One family moves to give their daughter a shot at a   education. The women accept     work to get a foot in the door. (The book, but not the movie, tells us that Dorothy Vaughan accepted a job as a laundress during the summer at NASA before being hired as a mathematician.) They left the comfort of home towns to move to Langley, Va. They overcame prejudice, rotten bosses and unpleasant work conditions. Another of the women, Mary Jackson, went to court to force a segregated high school to allow her to take classes when she was confronted with an education requirement for advancement. When a mammoth IBM computer gets installed, Vaughan figures out that electronic computing is the wave of the future. The biographies say that she “became an expert FORTRAN programmer. ” In fact she worked to become an expert, educating herself because she saw that the human computers (the women crunching the numbers) would not be needed one day. She was what we would now call a “lifelong learner. ” No one today expects workers to endure racism or sexism, but the tale is   in part, because it’s hard to imagine many Americans today enduring all that these women did. Leave home? Take a menial job and educate yourself at night? The NASA women’s expectations for what others would do for them was nonexistent. They knew that without education, ingenuity, dedication, personal sacrifice and initiative, they would not succeed. They actually had an “excuse”  —   Jim Crow  —   but they saw it as an obstacle, not a justification for failure. We can empathize with Rust Belt Americans displaced by automation and globalization without infantilizing them. Some are doing precisely what the NASA women did  —   figuring out how to navigate in a new world, educating themselves and redesigning their lives. That expectation should be the rule, not the exception. We should provide the means for Americans to transition to the 21st century and live productive, meaningful lives. Strain’s suggested policies are on the mark. But equally important is the message that we convey to those whom Trump treats as passive, hapless victims. We cannot allow them merely to blame others or resist the tasks (including relocation, lifelong learning) needed to improve their lives. Somewhere along the road to Trump and the intellectual and moral corruption of the right (which used to herald personal responsibility) this has gotten lost."
142501,217997,These coal country voters backed Trump. Now they’re worried about losing Obamacare.,Washington Post,Greg Sargent,2016-12-27,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161228001451/https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2016/12/27/these-coal-country-voters-backed-trump-now-theyre-worried-about-losing-obamacare/
","     Last night, CNN aired a terrific segment on people from coal country who voted for Donald Trump  —   but are now worried that his vow to repeal Obamacare will deprive them of crucial protections that enable them to stay afloat financially. This dovetails with other reporting that suggests a lot of Trump voters may be harmed by repeal of the law. Which raises a question: Did voters such as these know they were voting for this? After all, Trump promised countless times throughout the campaign to repeal the Affordable Care Act, didn’t he? If they are complaining about this now, don’t they have only themselves to blame? No. I’m going to argue that, while Trump did repeatedly vow repeal, these voters were absolutely right to conclude that he would not leave them without the sort of federal protections they enjoy under Obamacare. That’s because Trump did, in fact, clearly signal to them that this would not happen.  The CNN segment features people who live in Eastern Kentucky coal country and backed Trump because he promised to bring back coal jobs. Now, however, they worry that a provision in the ACA that makes it easier for longtime coal miners with black lung disease to get disability benefits could get eliminated along with the law. That provision shifted the burden of proving that the disability was directly caused by work in the mines away from the victim. Those benefits include financial and medical benefits. Some benefits now also extend to the widows of miners who had black lung disease  —   or pneumoconiosis, a lung illness associated with inhalation of coal dust  —   after their husbands die. Other reporting has also confirmed widespread coal country worries about losing these protections. One man who worked in the mines for 35 years told CNN’s Miguel Marquez: “When they eliminate the Obamacare, they may just eliminate all of the black lung program. It may all be gone. Don’t matter how many years you got. ” The widow of a deceased miner, who is now trying to get the benefits, said she doesn’t want to see Obamacare repealed, and even suggested Trump may be on the verge of betraying her and others in the region: “If he don’t come across like he promised, he’s not gonna be there next time. Not if I can help it. ” But what did Trump actually “promise”? These coal country residents are not quite in the same situation as many of the law’s other beneficiaries, who are currently gaining access to health coverage due to increased federal spending and regulation. But they are all benefiting from increased governmental intervention under the law designed to expand health care and support to   or sick people who were unable to secure it for themselves under the old system. Many of them would lose these benefits if the law is repealed.

","         For weeks now, nightmares have been jolting Olga Perez Stable Cox awake several hours before sunrise. Sometimes she’s able to fall back asleep, but more often she finds herself lying in the dark, body tossing and thoughts racing, until she’s reduced to tears. The morning offers fleeting distractions but no permanent relief  —   a cup of coffee, some Christmas decorating, maybe a phone call from concerned friends. But the blinds in her home will remain closed, her door will remain locked and the formerly outgoing professor  —   a woman who has always thrived by connecting with others  —   will spend another day isolated by fear, weeping, too scared to walk outside.  For as long as she has taught, Cox, a professor at Orange Coast College in Costa Mesa, Calif. has prided herself on speaking freely.

Now she’s back home, but her life hasn’t returned to normal. “Now, at 66, I’m paranoid,” Cox said. “It doesn’t feel good at all to be looking over my shoulder and wondering when an unfamiliar car pulls up across the street whether they’re going to take a picture of me or something worse  —   but that’s my life now. I feel like I’ve been attacked by a mob of people all across the country,” she added. “If they’re telling me over and over again that they want to shoot me in the face, how am I supposed to know if they’re going to do it or not?”  The mob Cox refers to doesn’t wield pitchforks and torches but   tweets, violent emails and threatening Facebook messages and phone calls. They are a virtual force with limited numbers but a seemingly unlimited supply of hate that has proved just as frightening for the longtime academic.

142503,217999,The U.S. spends more on health care than any other country. Here’s what we’re buying.,Washington Post,Carolyn Y. Johnson,2016-12-27,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161228001451/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/12/27/the-u-s-spends-more-on-health-care-than-any-other-country-heres-what-were-buying/
","     American   spending, measured in trillions of dollars, boggles the mind. Last year, we spent $3. 2 trillion on health care    a number so large that it can be difficult to grasp its scale. A new study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association reveals what patients and their insurers are spending that money on, breaking it down by 155 diseases, patient age and category    such as pharmaceuticals or hospitalizations. Among its findings:  Chronic    and often preventable    diseases are a huge driver of personal health spending. The three most expensive diseases in 2013: diabetes ($101 billion) the most common form of heart disease ($88 billion) and back and neck pain ($88 billion).   Yearly spending increases aren’t uniform: Over a nearly   period, diabetes and low back and neck pain grew at more than 6 percent per year    much faster than overall spending. Meanwhile, heart disease spending grew at 0. 2 percent.   Medical spending increases with age    with the exception of newborns. About 38 percent of personal health spending in 2013 was for people over age 65. Annual spending for girls between 1 and 4 years old averaged $2, 000 per person; older women 70 to 74 years old averaged $16, 000.  The analysis provides some insight into what’s driving one particularly large statistic: Within a decade, close to a fifth of the American economy will consist of health care. ”It’s important we have a complete landscape when thinking about ways to make the health care system more efficient,” said Joseph Dieleman, an assistant professor at the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington who led the work.  The data show that the primary drivers of   spending vary considerably. For example, more than half of diabetes care is spending on drugs, while only about 4 percent of spending on low back and neck pain was on pharmaceuticals. Generally, more spending is done on elderly people, but about 70 percent of the spending on low back and neck pain was on   adults. Such insights provide a way to find the drivers of growth in   spending and to launch strategies to control it. ”Data like this continues to draw attention to the fact a lot of these proposals being discussed about controlling   costs really don’t address the underlying issue, which is rising disease prevalence,” said Ken Thorpe, a professor of health policy at Emory University who was not involved in the study but has done similar research. ”You see this rise in chronic disease spending    much of it is potentially preventable.” Most of the discussion of health care in America has focused on access to insurance, but the spending breakdown shows that the biggest opportunities may come in preventing disease.  The researchers also analyzed spending on public health and prevention. In a separate editorial, Ezekiel Emanuel, a former   adviser to President Obama, pointed out that the largest public health spending was on HIV. But fewer than 7, 000 Americans died because of   in 2014 and it ranked 75th on the list of diseases by personal health expenditures. ”Few public health dollars focus on lifestyle conditions that ultimately contribute to the majority of chronic illnesses seen today,” Emanuel wrote. Low back and neck pain, for example, ranked low on the list of public health expenditures with $140 million in public health funding, but high on the list of   spending. Tobacco control received $340 million in public health spending, but smoking contributes to several diseases that drive   spending. What the data also show is that conditions that drive   spending aren’t necessarily the ones that come to mind when people think about health care. Falls were the   cause of health spending, followed closely by depression. Pregnancy and dental care were in the top 15.

"," Richard Adams, a British writer whose novel about rabbits, “Watership Down,” sold 50 million copies and mesmerized generations of readers by creating an ornately detailed fantasy world and subverting the   stereotype of warm and cuddly bunnies, died Dec. 24 at a nursing home in Oxford, England. He was 96.  He had a blood disorder, said a daughter, Juliet Johnson.  Mr. Adams was an    public servant when “Watership Down,” his first novel, was published in 1972. The book follows a band of rabbits who search for a new home after Fiver, the runt of his litter, has a vision of their grassy home  covered with blood  —   a result of the land’s being developed by  people for “high class modern  residences. ” Led by Fiver’s older brother Hazel, the rabbits journey across woods and stream to arrive at Watership Down, where they battle a totalitarian bunny named General Woundwort before establishing a new, utopian warren. Expecting a tale of friendly anthropomorphic animals in the spirit of Kenneth Grahame’s “The Wind in the Willows” or Beatrix Potter’s “Peter Rabbit” series, publishers and literary agents rejected “Watership Down” seven times, telling Mr. Adams that it was too childish for adults and too adult for children.   Mr. Adams, holding a pet mouse, in 1974. (Tom     Archive via Getty Images)  Chapters begin with epigraphs drawn from the Greek tragic playwright Aeschylus and the military theorist Carl von Clausewitz; and Mr. Adams’s leporine world is so detailed as to include rabbit mythology and an onomatopoeic rabbit language. But discovering that the rabbit word for car is “hrududu” was apparently part of the book’s magic. It won prestigious prizes for children’s literature in England and earned the previously unknown Mr. Adams comparisons to Grahame and J. R. R. Tolkien. “If there is no place for ‘Watership Down’ in children’s bookshops,” the Economist magazine wrote, “then children’s literature is dead. ” The novel’s appeal, according to Cathryn M. Mercier, director of the Center for the Study of Children’s Literature at Simmons College in Boston, rested as much on its richly textured fantasy world as its apparent parallels to the human world. “We see qualities of ourselves in those feisty little rabbits,” she said. In one section, a rabbit named Strawberry offers a rebuke to human ways in an explanation of how animals are different from people: “If they have to fight, they fight; and if they have to kill, they kill. But they don’t sit down and set their wits to work to devise ways of spoiling other creatures’ lives and hurting them. They have dignity and animality. ” Mr. Adams later revealed that the book’s rabbit heroes were based on his commanding officers in the British military during World War II, but he decried attempts to find larger meanings in the novel. “I promise you it is not a fable or an allegory or a parable of any kind,” he told the Pittsburgh Press upon its release. “It is a story about rabbits, that is all. ” An animated movie was made in 1978, with voices provided by actors such as John Hurt, Ralph Richardson and Zero Mostel. A musical and an animated television series followed. In a sign of the book’s reach, it even introduced the idea of a rabbit to readers who had never seen one: The covers of some worldwide editions featured gerbils scampering over sand dunes. Richard George Adams was born in Newbury, England, on May 9, 1920. He was the youngest of three children, the son of a nurse and a father who, when he wasn’t working as the local doctor, tested Mr. Adams on the names of the birds and other wildlife that  surrounded their home, urging him to learn, as well, his knotgrass and pimpernel, heartsease and speedwell. As a “kind of joke” and nod to his father, Mr. Adams used early royalties from “Watership Down” to buy a genuine coat of arms for himself, appropriately featuring three rabbits on a green ground. With the outbreak of World War II, he left the University of Oxford to enlist in the Royal Army Service Corps. He later joined a British army airborne division but never saw combat. He completed his degree after the war. He received an honors degree in modern history in the late 1940s, also from Oxford, and moved  directly into the British civil  service, where he spent the next two decades. Working on issues as varied as slum clearance, outdoor advertising regulations and the Thames Flood Barrier, a London landmark, he rose to the position of assistant secretary in what would later become the Department of the Environment. Because of the amount of information Mr. Adams was required to gorge and synthesize, the job was “good training for a novelist,” he later told People magazine. His writing career happened almost by chance. Mr. Adams had children late in life and liked to entertain them with stories. In 1966, driving from London to    Shakespeare’s birthplace, he began  telling them about two rabbits named Fiver and Hazel who  traveled to the   Watership Down, five miles from his  childhood home. Two weeks later, when he had finished his improvised tale, his daughters urged him to write it down. He completed the book over the next two years. His next novel, “Shardik” (1974) a religious epic about a bear worshiped as a god, met with mixed reviews and some  befuddlement for going so far afield from the green grass and warrens where Mr. Adams had made his name. Critics panned its characters as stilted and   but Mr. Adams considered it his finest work and quit the civil service to write full time after its release. He took his library, family and money to the Isle of Man, a British Crown dependency, to escape higher English taxes. His apparent disdain for  negative reviews was tested by his later novels. “The Plague Dogs” (1977) chronicled the escape of two dogs from an experimental laboratory in England’s Lake District. The book presaged his turbulent   term as president of the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, from which he resigned in 1982 because, he told the London Independent, the leaders “seemed to be more concerned with each other than with the animals. ” “The Girl in a Swing” (1980) and “Maia” (1985) were erotic love stories concerned with female sexuality. The books  coincided with the transition of Mr. Adams’s public image from children’s writer and animal  advocate to an elderly man with, in his words, “a pretty erotic  disposition. ” Survivors include his wife,  Barbara Acland, whom he married in 1949, and two daughters, Juliet Johnson and Rosamond Mahony; six grandchildren; and one  . For the past three decades of his life, Mr. Adams lived in the small town of Whitchurch, in southern Hampshire. His private library was considered one of England’s finest, with works that included a second folio of  Shakespeare and a Bible that had belonged to King Charles II. Mr. Adams wrote a memoir of his early years, “The Day Gone By” (1990) and returned to the rabbits that made him famous just once, publishing “Tales From  Watership Down” in 1996. The book, a collection of intertwined stories, served as prequel and  sequel to the original novel. He seemed at peace with the fact that nothing matched the success of his literary debut. “I try to look at it in a positive way,” he told the London  Guardian in 2015, “to say to  myself, ‘Look at “Watership Down”  —   if you can do that, you can do any ruddy thing.’ “Of course you can’t expect to have another success like that, but it does give you the confidence and the enjoyment to go on  writing. ” "
142506,218003,"No, Mozart did not have 2016’s best-selling CD. What really happened is even more surprising.",Washington Post,Todd C. Frankel,2016-12-27,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161228001451/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2016/12/27/no-mozart-did-not-have-have-2016s-best-selling-cd-what-really-happened-is-even-more-surprising/
","     In a year marked by surprises, it seemed fitting that, as a recent story on Billboard’s website attested, the   CD in 2016 came from Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, who has been dead for 225 years. So move over, Drake. Take that, Adele. Mozart is king. The story was widely picked up and shared, from Forbes to NPR. It seemed to confirm the sad state of a music industry rocked by successive waves of technology and declining sales. Mozart was said to have claimed his posthumous title in an unusual way  —   by supposedly selling 6, 250 units of a new   box set. That works out to an impressive 1. 25 million CDs, which the Billboard story claimed made it the year’s top seller. But the Mozart story was more marketing hype than true  —   because no one counts box sets as single CDs and, in fact, fewer than 300 Mozart box sets have been sold in the United States (equaling a more modest 60, 000 CDs) the market tracked by Billboard’s famous charts, according to Nielsen, which provides the data used by Billboard to compile its various lists of the   tunes. Yet the Mozart story also obscured an even more surprising fact about the music industry in 2016: It was a pretty good year. While the salad days of the CD era just a decade ago are gone, the industry is no longer in free fall. Technology has changed how we define what it means to buy music. And this year it became increasingly clear that people once again are paying for their music, just in different ways. “That’s the interesting part,” said David Bakula, a senior vice president at Nielsen. “There’s not a lull in the music industry. There’s been a dramatic change in consumption. ” Consider the case of Canadian rapper Drake, who earned the true title for   album of 2016. It was for his latest release “Views,” which includes the singles “Hotline Bling” and “One Dance. ” The album  —   in various forms  —   has sold just shy of 4 million units going into year’s end. How Nielsen accounts for that number reflects how much the music industry has shifted in the past decade. Today, Nielsen tallies up digital and physical album sales, digital single sales and online audio streams. That gives you the new metric that the industry lives and dies by: the   unit. Drake has sold only about 300, 000 physical CDs. But the album enjoyed 1. 2 million digital album sales, 5 million digital singles sales and an astonishing 2. 8 billion audio streams. Nielsen divides digital singles by 10 and audio streams by 1, 500 to create new numbers that equal the revenue from a single album sale. Looking at the health of the music industry in this way  —   with a mishmash of financial ratios that attempts to capture how people consume music today  —   shows that overall music sales are up 3 percent through 50 weeks in 2016, compared with last year, Bakula said. So, yes, traditional album sales are down 16 percent. That’s bad. (Interestingly, digital album sales fell faster than physical album sales, too.) Digital single sales are down 25 percent. That’s even worse. But revenue from   digital streams exploded 77 percent over last year, reaching 234 billion streams. “You’ve gone from a world where digital disturbed the scene, but now digital is falling in terms of ownership [of music],” Bakula said. Today, “the digital consumer has switched to streaming. ” The streaming number comes from services such as Spotify, Apple Music, Napster, Google and Amazon, which offer huge buffets of music through either subscriptions or   models. (Amazon. com founder Jeffrey P. Bezos owns The Washington Post.) But Nielsen’s streaming count does not include online sites popular with music lovers such as Pandora, which acts more like a radio station, or YouTube, where users often play music videos. After years of worry that technology would foster only the theft of digital music, artists finally are getting paid  —   albeit fractions of a penny for each song streamed. That’s why it takes 1, 500 song streams to equal the financial impact of a single physical music CD. Those fractions of a penny can add up. In May, Drake set a record for the number of digital audio songs streamed in a single week: 246 million. Drake became only the third artist to ever crack the       milestone. And he crushed it. Drake then surpassed that   milestone seven more times this year. “He is the master of streaming,” Bakula said. Adele, the British singer behind the year’s No. 2 release, has taken a different approach to selling music. Adele has moved 2. 3 million units this year, despite her album ”25” actually debuting in 2015. But more than half of her sales (1. 2 million) have come from physical CD sales  —   four times what Drake sold in music hard copies. Adele had an exclusive deal with Target to sell a special edition of her CD. She also refused to allow streaming services to tap her new album until late June. “It’s completely different consumption models for different artists,” Bakula said. In the first six months of 2016, the money coming in from subscription streaming services more than offset continuing drops in sales of physical and digital music, according to the Recording Industry Association of America. Revenue from retail sales grew 8. 1 percent compared with the same period in 2015  —   the strongest growth since the late 1990s. The overall share of revenue coming from streaming hit 38 percent, through 50 weeks of this year, Nielsen said. The death of the traditional album is not exaggerated. This year will mark the first since 1991, when Nielsen began tracking sales, that no album moves at least 2 million units in either physical or digital form. Last year, there were five. Bakula said it’s an outdated metric. “That’s not how we should measure success anymore,” he said. It’s understandable why the Mozart story would gain traction. It reflected how the music world used to operate  —   putting aside doubts about whether each CD in the box set should be tallied as a separate sale. Last week, the original Billboard story was quietly updated with a new, more subdued headline that calls the box set only “a Surprisingly Hot Seller. ” (Billboard declined a request for comment.) For a box set that includes 240 hours of music, every work by the famous composer, that’s probably true. But in the music industry’s new world, it was not even close to a title contender."
142507,218004,We are sending kids the wrong message about adulthood. Here’s what needs to change.,Washington Post,Judy Mollen Walters,2016-12-27,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161228001451/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/parenting/wp/2016/12/27/we-are-sending-kids-the-wrong-message-about-adulthood-heres-what-needs-to-change/
","     My    daughter had an adult moment recently. A graduate student with an internship, she recently was seeing a client, who, at the end of their meeting, called her Ms. Walters and asked for her business card. “I think I’m an adult,” she texted me. There are so many ways  —   little and big  —   that we mark our kids’ passage to adulthood. When I was in the process of becoming an adult, it seemed like getting married was one marker, though at the time I wasn’t thinking, “Now I’m an adult. ” I was thinking that I was so happy to be married to my husband. Then I had my first baby  —   the now     —   and I was really an adult. Within just a few years I had a mortgage and two babies. It’s what people did. I never thought about it much, at least not consciously. I was just living my life. Becoming an adult  —   didn’t that just   …     happen? Or was it more complicated than that? These days it feels like we shift our young people ever so gradually and tenderly toward adulthood that they can barely feel themselves doing it. There are books everywhere teaching children how to become adults, or telling us to teach them how to do it. It never dawned on me that I would need to learn to teach my child to become an adult. Doesn’t it just happen naturally at some point? Didn’t we celebrate our child’s every birthday not only with cake and candles, but also with the idea that becoming a year older was something to mark? I feel like not so much. Many of us send our children the message that being an adult is bad. That being an adult is too hard. That you’re better off not being an adult. And what we get in return is a lot of kids who, well, don’t turn into adults. We all know them  —   the kids who don’t make plans out of high school and then don’t follow any particular path. They take a college course and drop out. They don’t work. They sit around the house a lot. Maybe they go to college, but they don’t get a job after college; perhaps they avoid looking for a job altogether. Maybe their   degree is stretching into six or seven years. They’re in their 20s, closing in on 30, and still living at home,   or unemployed, not in school, with no direction. Their parents cook their meals, do their laundry and help them function in their daily lives. What have we taught them? Have we given them the impression that adulthood is not worth looking forward to? I see it all the time on Facebook. There are memes from   friends about wanting to be children again themselves (they seem to forget that when you’re a kid, you don’t get the adult brain to deal with simple kid stuff). Friends lament that their teens don’t know how easy they have it (that one is really off  —   a teenager is perhaps the hardest thing one could ever be). When I see these memes and lamentations, I want to say  —   and sometimes do  —   that contrary to what my friends are saying, adulthood is great. It is liberating. You can decide what you want to do and how and when you want to do it. You don’t even need to know why you want to do something before you actually do it. My husband and I don’t have all the answers, and I am quick to say we got very lucky with our kids. But we did try to impress upon them when they were growing up that being an adult is something worth striving for. We taught them that it’s fun to make decisions and that being in control of your life is a source of pride and excitement. My older daughter spent all of her senior year of college applying to graduate schools. It was hard. She had interviews and essays and deadlines on top of her coursework and her job. But then she landed free graduate school and a paid internship and now she’s working and studying upward of 50 or 60 hours a week. That’s adulthood. That’s not a bad thing. That’s a good thing. Our younger daughter spent all of last year applying to colleges. She had three Advanced Placement classes and a job. It was hard. But she got accepted at eight schools, picked one and she’s there now learning more about being an adult. She’s having a great time but working really hard in her classes while she negotiates daily life. Those are not bad things. Those are good things. It’s not bad to be financially independent. It’s not bad to live in a tiny apartment and eat spaghetti most nights while watching TV because you don’t have any money to go out. It’s not bad to drive a    car and hope that it lasts another few months. It’s not bad to have to get up with an alarm, or study for a test in a subject you don’t know much about, or learn to live with people you might never normally have a reason to be around, or share a bathroom with 10 other people at the end of the hallway. It’s not bad to set goals and then go after them, no matter how hard it may seem to reach them. These are good things. Being an adult is good. Let’s not only keep teaching our kids that. Let’s believe it ourselves.              Caption   Children draw the gifts they are hoping to receive from Santa.

In this scenario, the winner of Sunday night’s   game will clinch the NFC North division title, while the loser will be a   behind Washington for the second   spot and will be eliminated as a result. The Redskins must root against a tie because of tiebreaker implications. If the Redskins, Packers and Lions all finish at    the Packers would win the NFC North because of a better    record against the Lions. Meanwhile, Detroit would clinch the sixth seed because of its    tiebreaker over Washington. The Lions defeated the Redskins,   in Week 7 at Ford Field.  The NFL has never had a season with three regular season ties since overtime was instituted in 1974. There have already been two draws this season, matching the 1986 and 1997 seasons for the most since regular season overtime rules were adopted. Along with Washington’s tie with the Cincinnati Bengals in Week 8, the Seattle Seahawks and Arizona Cardinals recorded a tie in Week 7. The Cowboys defeated the Buccaneers in Week 15; that would’ve allowed the Redskins to take control of the sixth seed last week, but they lost to the Carolina Panthers to remain   behind both the Packers and Bucs. Washington received every break it needed in Week 16 to set up essentially a    situation. The New Orleans Saints defeated the Tampa Bay Buccaneers ( ) who now sit a   behind Washington following the loss, and the Cowboys beat the Lions despite already clinching the NFC East division title and home field advantage throughout the playoffs. Washington now sits in position to make the playoffs for the second consecutive season heading into the final week of the season.

","        “The photo of people entrenched at Standing Rock has visual cues to images of protest and, with the barbed wire, even war zones. It is a reminder that even though war seems very far away, every day in our own nation there are front lines and battles being fought. ”  —     Lam (Stephanie  )  As photo editors, we see millions of photos through the year. Many of the images never make publication. Some are inspirational and happy, and some are tragic and terribly graphic. As we tell stories with the photos we choose, there are always images that resonate with us, change us and are sometimes hard to forget. Here are those images.    “It’s a stark reminder that the migrants lost in the Mediterranean are not the only ones who face death to escape war, tyranny and economic despair. Along the southwestern border of the United States an ocean of arid land claims lives as surely as the sea between Europe and Africa. Often just as anonymously and leaving families forever wondering about missing loved ones. Ricky Carioti captured the discovery of a skull in a way akin to a macabre Renaissance painting, disturbing and troubling, a reminder that death awaits. ”  —   Mark Miller     “It’s clear that the rush for cobalt in Congo has thousands of workers digging by hand in unsafe conditions for it. Cobalt is a key ingredient in   batteries. What gives one pause is that devices that use these batteries  —   our cameras, phones and computers  —   were necessary in the collection and distribution of The Post’s findings. Still, Michael Robinson Chavez has made a beautiful and memorable photo of this laborer heading into the mine. ”  —   Thomas Simonetti     “I love the contrast of the ancient and the advanced between the Great Pyramids of Giza and the   monoplane, Solar Impulse 2, flying above on its    . And that sunlight hitting the plane makes it stand out from the murky desert landscape and the silhouetted pyramids. ”  —   Steve Cook (Jean    )     “Donald Trump was relentless in his pursuit to connect with his target voters, making multiple stops per day at arenas and airport hangars. Jabin Botsford’s photo of Trump supporters waving at his plane showed the fervor of the campaign without showing the candidate. ”  —   Robert Miller     “So often photojournalists keep their eyes on the action. The person speaking, the person crying and so on. These are the images that win awards, and they make for good journalism. But sometimes it can be more powerful to see what lies outside the frame. For me, this poignant photo by Jim Lo Scalzo for the European Pressphoto Agency of staffers listening to President Obama’s address after Hillary Clinton conceded to Trump shows just this. The photographer took a risk by moving his camera away from the president and in return, he captured the context of his speech with more complexity and grace than any headshot image could. ”  —   Karly Domb Sadof     “I had seen many heartbreaking images of refugees crammed in boats, dying, trying to escape the horrors happening in Syria  —   but none moved me quite the way this photo did. The photo of Eritrean refugees swimming to a rescue boat off the coast of Libya made the crisis very real for me. Photographer Emilio Morenatti captured their desperation and struggle as they swam for their lives. At that moment, it felt as if they were swimming to me. ”  —   Dee Swann     “In Haiti, a desperately poor country pummeled by Hurricane Matthew,    Bellande Lubin washes her sandals in Les Cayes.

142510,218012,Kerry harshly condemns Israeli settler activity as an obstacle to peace,Washington Post,Carol Morello,2016-12-28,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161229004018/https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/kerry-address-middle-east-peace-process-amid-deep-us-israel-strains/2016/12/28/d656e5fa-cd0a-11e6-b8a2-8c2a61b0436f_story.html
"," Secretary of State John F. Kerry on Wednesday harshly criticized Israeli settlements in the West Bank, saying their growth threatens to destroy the viability of a   solution to the   conflict, and that the United States was obliged to allow passage of a U. N. resolution condemning the activity in order to preserve the possibility of peace. Kerry noted that the number of Israelis living in settlements has grown significantly and that their outposts are extending farther into the West Bank  —   “in the middle of what, by any reasonable definition, would be the future Palestinian state. ” “No one thinking seriously about peace can ignore the reality of what the settlements pose to that peace,” he said. Kerry, in the   speech delivered at the State Department, also condemned Palestinian incitement to violence as a barrier to direct negotiations. But his focus was on defending the Obama administration’s policies and highlighting Israel’s actions at a moment of high tension between the two governments, following the passage of the U. N. resolution.       (Reuters)   “Regrettably, some seem to believe that the U. S. friendship means the U. S. must accept any policy, regardless of our own interests, our own positions, our own words, our own principles  —   even after urging again and again that the policy must change,” he said. “Friends need to tell each other the hard truths, and friendships require mutual respect. ” He said the vote at the United Nations was about “Israel’s future as a Jewish and democratic state, living side by side in peace and security with its neighbors. That’s what we are trying to preserve, for our sake and for theirs. ” Saying the   solution was in “serious jeopardy,” Kerry said Israel would never improve its relations with Arab countries if it precludes the possibility of a separate state for Palestinians. “If the choice is one state, Israel can either be Jewish or Democratic,” he said. “It cannot be both. ” Some Israeli politicians applauded Kerry’s speech. Former prime minister Ehud Barak tweeted that it was a “Powerful, lucid speech. World & majority in Israel think the same. ” But most Israeli leaders and the political right immediately took umbrage, accusing Kerry of trying to dictate policy to an elected government.  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called the speech “a big disappointment. ”      (Reuters)   “He deals obsessively with the settlements, he fails to deal with the Palestinian failure to recognize a Jewish state,” Netanyahu said, adding, “If he put the same emphasis on Palestinian incitement and terror that he did on settlements then maybe we will be on the way to peace. ” Kerry acknowledged that his vision is not shared by   Donald Trump. “President Obama and I know that the incoming administration has signaled that they may take a different path, and even suggested breaking from the   U. S. policies on settlements, Jerusalem  —   and possibly the   solution,” Kerry said. “That is for them to decide  —   that’s how we work. But we cannot, in good conscience, do nothing, and say nothing, when we see the hope of peace slipping away. This is a time to stand up for what is right. ” Trump has said that he will move the U. S. Embassy to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv, a move freighted with political significance in advance of any settlement, and his nominee to be ambassador to Israel, David M. Friedman, has said Jewish settlements in the West Bank are legal.  About two hours before Kerry started speaking, Trump tweeted his criticism of the Obama administration: “We cannot continue to let Israel be treated with such total disdain and disrespect. They used to have a great friend in the U. S. but . . . not anymore. The beginning of the end was the horrible Iran deal, and now this (U. N.)! Stay strong Israel, January 20th is fast approaching!” Netanyahu, in turn, promptly tweeted his gratitude: “  Trump, thank you for your warm friendship and your   support for Israel!” Although he did not mention Netanyahu by name, Kerry addressed   the Israeli leader’s assertions that the United States had “colluded” in and “orchestrated” last week’s U. N. resolution affirming that settlement activity in the West Bank and East Jerusalem has “no legal validity and constitutes a flagrant violation under international law and a major obstacle to the achievement of the   solution. ” Kerry denied that the United States drafted or promoted the resolution. But he acknowledged that the United States took part in preliminary discussions, as is routine. Kerry said the diplomats told other Security Council members they would oppose a resolution that did not condemn Palestinian incitement to violence. They also said if the text were more “balanced,” it was “possible” the United States would not block it. Kerry called the current Israeli governing coalition the most   in country’s history and said it is driven by an extremist settler agenda inimical to a   agreement. “The result is that policies of this government, which the prime minister himself just described as ‘more committed to settlements than any in Israel’s history,’ are leading in the opposite direction,” Kerry said. “They’re leading towards one state. ” “The vote in the United Nations was about preserving the   solution,” he added. “That’s what we were standing up for. ” Kerry offered six principles that he said would satisfy Israeli security needs and Palestinian aspirations for a homeland. Most have been proven sticking points in previous negotiations  —   among them, Jerusalem as a mutual capital for two states; normalized relations with Arab states in the region; and financial compensation for Palestinian refugees, along with acknowledgment of their suffering. Kerry returned from vacation to give his speech, which was being worked on until a few minutes before he walked on stage in the Dean Acheson Auditorium. It was a sign that the administration was still struggling to deal with the political firestorm ignited by the resolution vote. The outrage in the Israeli government has been matched among some members of Congress. Sen. John McCain ( .) chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, called Kerry’s speech “at best a pointless tirade in the waning days of an outgoing administration. ” The U. S. abstention has been condemned by several Democrats as well, including Sen. Charles E. Schumer (N. Y.) who is the party’s incoming leader. But for Kerry it was a speech that captured the   frustration that has grown in the two years since his   effort to broker a peace agreement collapsed, and his attempts to tamp down Palestinian violence came to nothing. And Kerry, famous for always sounding a hopeful note, was clearly pessimistic about whether his words would make any difference. “We can only encourage them to take this path,” he said. “We cannot walk down it for them. ”  Eglash reported from Jerusalem.

","       Donald Trump privately told several visitors to his winter retreat in Florida on Wednesday that he is writing the first draft of his inaugural speech and is looking to presidents Ronald Reagan and John F. Kennedy for inspiration, according to three people familiar with the conversation. Trump told them that Reagan’s “style” and Kennedy’s articulation of grand national ambitions are central to how he thinks through his own speech, which will be given Jan. 20, the people said. And while Trump is working closely with Stephen Miller, his aide and speechwriter, on the text, he confided that in recent days he has become more personally involved in the writing process, the people said. The people requested anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the conversation. A Trump transition spokesperson was not available for comment.  Trump made his private remarks during lunchtime at his    club in Palm Beach, Fla. to presidential historian Douglas Brinkley, Bloomberg columnist Margaret Carlson, Democratic lobbyist Thomas Quinn and Newsmax Media chief executive Christopher Ruddy, who is a longtime friend of the  . While the media and political personalities were dining together as Ruddy’s guests, Trump  —   who has been at the property for most of late December  —   ventured over at various points during a   period to speak with them, the people said. A person familiar with Trump’s comments said he is “enamored with Reagan’s confident style and how he connected with the country. ” “He went on and on about Reagan and how much he admires him. But it wasn’t all about Reagan. He spoke about Kennedy and how he was able to get the country motivated, to go to the moon. He’s thinking about both men as he starts to write the speech, which is something he’s now taking the lead on,” the person said. The person added that part of the draw to Kennedy is that Trump knows that “what would have been Kennedy’s 100th birthday will come only a few months after his inauguration next year. ” When reached Wednesday by phone, Brinkley, who is a professor at Rice University in Houston, declined to discuss Trump’s framework for the inaugural address. But he confirmed that Trump spoke at length about history and asked questions about past inaugurations. “We talked about JFK and Reagan and about how William Henry Harrison caught pneumonia after giving too long of an inaugural speech,” Brinkley said. “I was there as a presidential historian, telling stories and listening to his view of the presidency. ” Brinkley said he found Trump to be “relaxed and utterly gracious” and “as happy to talk about NBA basketball as he was about history. ” “It reminded me a little of Nixon, who loved football,” he said. “When I raised the fact that I was writing a book about Kennedy and the moon shot and NASA, he did talk about how he admires Kennedy in addition to Reagan. There was admiration for Reagan’s style and for Kennedy,” Brinkley said. “He recognizes that he’s entering a club,” he continued. “Even if he didn’t spend a lifetime reading presidential biographies, he appreciates that he is joining the club and is learning more about its traditions. ” According to the people familiar with the conversation, Trump also told the group that he was nearing decisions on the remaining slots in his cabinet  —   secretary of agriculture and secretary of veterans affairs  —   but he did not disclose his list of finalists. A lighter moment came when Trump asked Brinkley about how presidents gave inaugural addresses before the invention of the microphone. Brinkley told Trump that presidents would have supporters whisper the speech through the crowd so that people in the back could know what was being said. Trump found the anecdote amusing.        Donald Trump will be sworn into office during the 58th inauguration on Jan. 20. Here’s a look at what we know about the planned inaugural activities and a look back at how the tradition has evolved.

","     After having repeatedly praised President Obama’s efforts to ensure a smooth transition,   Donald Trump reversed course on Wednesday, accusing the current occupant of the Oval Office of putting “roadblocks” in his way. Trump took to Twitter shortly after 9 a. m. saying he was “doing my best to disregard the many inflammatory President O statements and roadblocks. ”   Doing my best to disregard the many inflammatory President O statements and roadblocks.

The White House declined to comment on Trump’s tweet and others that followed.      President Obama and   Donald Trump had kind words for each other in the aftermath of the election. Then things seemed to change after Christmas. (Bastien   Washington Post)   Trump’s assessment comes amid days of verbal sparring between the outgoing and incoming president. During a ceremony Tuesday marking the Japanese attack at Pearl Harbor 75 years ago, Obama cautioned against “the urge to turn inward” and stressed a need to “resist the urge to demonize those who are different”  —   remarks some thought were aimed partly at Trump. Trump also made it clear Wednesday that he is perturbed by a number of steps the Obama administration is taking in its final weeks related to Israel, including a speech that was planned Wednesday by Secretary of State John F. Kerry on Middle East policy.   We cannot continue to let Israel be treated with such total disdain and disrespect. They used to have a great friend in the U. S. but. .... ..  —   Donald J.

Stay strong Israel, January 20th is fast approaching!  —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 28, 2016   “We cannot continue to let Israel be treated with such total disdain and disrespect,” Trump wrote in another series of tweets. “They used to have a good friend in the U. S. but   …     not anymore. ” Trump said the “beginning of the end” was the “horrible” Iran nuclear deal reached last year that was supported by a coalition of world powers but vigorously opposed by Israel. Trump was also highly critical this week of the Obama administration’s refusal to veto a United Nations Security Council resolution condemning Israeli settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. “Stay strong Israel, January 20th is fast approaching!” Trump wrote on Twitter, referring to his inauguration date. During a conference call with reporters later Wednesday morning, transition spokesman Sean Spicer at first declined to elaborate on Trump’s tweets, saying they “speak for themselves. ” He later said that Obama and his administration officials have been generous with their time during the transition process and helpful with “mechanical” issues. On Wednesday afternoon, during a brief appearance before reporters at his    estate in Palm Beach, Fla. Trump was asked about whether he thinks the transition is going smoothly. “Oh, I think very, very smoothly,” he replied. “Very good. You don’t think so?” Trump also sounded more conciliatory later in the afternoon, when he told reporters that Obama had called him earlier in the day. “He called me, we had a very nice conversation,” Trump said, without offering much elaboration. Trump’s view of his Democratic predecessor soured earlier this week when Obama said on a podcast hosted by his former adviser, David Axelrod, that he thought he could have prevailed in an election over Trump.  Those comments prompted two tweets in as many days from Trump contesting Obama’s assessment. On Tuesday, Trump chided Obama for the failure of his campaign efforts on behalf of Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton to bear fruit. “President Obama campaigned hard (and personally) in the very important swing states and lost,” Trump said in a tweet. “The voters wanted to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!” Juliet Eilperin contributed to this report."
142513,218015,Obama beats Trump where it will sting: He’s the most admired man in America,Washington Post,Philip Bump,2016-12-28,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161229004018/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/12/28/obama-beats-trump-where-it-will-sting-hes-the-most-admired-man-in-america/
","Since Gallup began asking Americans the people they admired the most, there’s been a consistent pattern: Whoever was president or   was almost always the man the country admired the most. The most admired woman? Usually someone who had been married to a president. Only five times has the most admired man in the country not been a president  —   past, current or elected. And in 2016, the trend continued, with President Obama retaining the title he’s held since 2008.     For each of the past 15 years, the most admired woman has been a very particular former first lady: Hillary Clinton. Clinton has been named America’s most admired woman 21 times, the most of any winner of the title. It’s often been a squeaker, such as when she narrowly edged out Sarah Palin in 2009. But in 2016, as in years past, no woman has been identified as the most admired more than Clinton.     (Where two women were tied, only the woman listed first in Gallup’s   is shown.) Her opponent in this year’s presidential contest, though, didn’t fare quite as well. Donald Trump had the most support of any   finisher over the past decade, but it wasn’t enough to catch Obama. The percentage of the population that identifies him as the man they admire the most has consistently outpaced the field since he earned the top spot.     This news, coming at this moment, will probably be somewhat galling to Trump. Over the weekend, Obama told his former adviser David Axelrod that he believed he could have won in 2016, a claim at which Trump chafed. To lose an admiration contest in the wake of that seems as though it would be particularly frustrating to the  . It’s probably a function of the popularity of each man. In 2008, Obama won the   title easily, thanks to his historic election and George W. Bush’s low approval ratings. In 2000, Bill Clinton topped George W. Bush, albeit barely. By 2001, Bush set a record in the polling, with 39 percent identifying him as most admired  —   thanks in no small part to his response to the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. The big question is what happens next year. Past presidents have often won the crown of most admired, as noted above. Bill Clinton, for example, has been in the top 10 for 25 years. (Trump has made the top 10 six times, including 1988 through 1990, 2011 and last year.) Will Obama continue to be viewed as more admirable to Americans even once Trump has taken office? One bet that’s probably safe to make: Hillary Clinton will win again in 2017.         "
142514,218016,"With new monuments in Nevada, Utah, Obama adds to his environmental legacy",Washington Post,Juliet Eilperin,2016-12-28,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161229004018/https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/with-new-monuments-in-nevada-utah-obama-adds-to-his-environmental-legacy/2016/12/28/e9833f62-c471-11e6-8422-eac61c0ef74d_story.html
","      President Obama on Wednesday created new national monuments in a sacred tribal site in southeastern Utah and in a swath of Nevada desert, after years of political fights over the fate of the areas. The designations further cement Obama’s environmental legacy as one of the most consequential  —   and contentious  —   in presidential history. He has invoked his executive power to create national monuments 29 times during his tenure, establishing or expanding protections for more than 553 million acres of federal lands and waters. Environmental groups have praised the conservation efforts, but critics say they amount to a federal land grab. Some worry that the new designations could fuel another armed protest by antigovernment forces inspired by the Cliven Bundy family, such as the takeover of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in Oregon this year.  Obama’s newest designations include two sprawling Western landscapes that are under threat, yet also where local residents are deeply divided on how the land should be used.     Jose Witt, Southern Nevada director of Friends of Nevada Wilderness, points out petroglyphs while leading a hike this fall in Gold Butte. The area is now one of the newest national monuments. (Ronda   The Washington Post)  In Utah, where the federal government owns about   of the land, the designation of another 1. 35 million acres to create the Bears Ears National Monument undoubtedly will prove polarizing. For the first time, Native American tribes will offer management input for a national monument through an   commission. Five tribes that often have been at odds  —   the Hopi, Navajo, Uintah and Ouray Ute, Ute Mountain Ute and Pueblo of Zuni  —   will together have responsibility for protecting an area that contains   remnants of ancestral Pueblo sites dating back more than 3, 500 years. “We have always looked to Bears Ears as a place of refuge, as a place where we can gather herbs and medicinal plants, and a place of prayer and sacredness,” Russell Begaye, president of the Navajo Nation, said in a call with reporters Wednesday. “These places  —   the rocks, the wind, the land  —   they are living, breathing things that deserve timely and lasting protection. ” While many environmentalists and archaeologists supported the monument, most Utah politicians opposed the site’s unilateral protection. Instead, House Natural Resources Committee Chairman Rob Bishop ( ) and a fellow Utah Republican, Rep. Jason Chaffetz, devoted three years to drafting a   bill that would have protected a large portion of the site but would have allowed some development. The bill stalled in the House. In a statement Wednesday, Chaffetz said he was “outraged” by the designation, saying Obama’s decision “politicizes a   conflict. ” “The midnight move is a slap in the face to the people of Utah, attempting to silence the voices of those who will bear the heavy burden it imposes,” he said, vowing to work with the Trump administration to try to repeal the decision. “It does not have the support of the Governor, a single member of the state’s congressional delegation, nor any local elected officials or state legislators who represent the area. ” Meanwhile, the Gold Butte National Monument in Nevada has been a site of contention for more than 15 years. As Las Vegas sought to expand, local, state and federal managers agreed to protect species such as the imperiled desert tortoise in Gold Butte. But they did little for either the animals or the actual sagebrush steppe and Mojave Desert in the approximately   area marked by fossilized sand dunes and panels of petroglyphs that tower over the landscape.     Although all the legal grazing permits in the area northeast of Las Vegas were sold more than a decade ago as part of a deal with environmental groups and county officials, a single family  —   headed by cattle rancher Cliven Bundy  —   refused to recognize federal officials’ authority over the government land. The Bundys engaged in an armed standoff with Bureau of Land Management officials in 2014; several still await trial for the confrontation. Their followers occupied the Malheur refuge in January. In a statement, Obama said Wednesday’s designations “protect some of our country’s most important cultural treasures, including abundant rock art, archaeological sites, and lands considered sacred by Native American tribes. Today’s actions will help protect this cultural legacy and will ensure that future generations are able to enjoy and appreciate these scenic and historic landscapes. ”  Senate Minority Leader Harry M. Reid ( .) who has put more than 5 million acres of federal land in his home state   to development, pressed relentlessly for Obama to invoke his executive authority on behalf of Gold Butte. Reid intensified his campaign when the Bundys were jailed this year for a takeover at the Oregon wildlife refuge, arguing that any pushback would be minimized while they were incarcerated.    “Gold Butte is a fascinating place full of natural wonders,” Reid said in a statement Wednesday. “Protecting Gold Butte ensures that generations of people will continue to have the opportunity to experience Nevada’s natural beauty. We’ve done something lasting and historic today. ” Obama on Wednesday created both sites using his authority under the 1906 Antiquities Act, which gives the president power to designate national monuments without approval from Congress. But Republicans have raised the prospect of curtailing the law when they control both the executive and legislative branches next year. How their effort fares could determine not only what safeguards persist for the landscape, rock carvings and other archaeological sites in Bears Ears and Gold Butte, but also what power future presidents can wield over the nation’s most ecologically and historically significant federal holdings. Kristen Brengel, vice president of government affairs for the National Parks Conservation Association, said in an interview that she and others “just hope the American public rejects” efforts to curtail the act. Both Bishop and the congressman Donald Trump has tapped to head the Interior Department, Ryan Zinke ( .) support changes.  “It’s a wonderful law that allows the president to make quick decisions to protect areas when they need it,” Brengel said. “Why would we want to destroy that?” BLM officials have documented acts of vandalism and looting in Bears Ears, but Bishop said he does not view it as being “in imminent danger. ” He met on Dec. 5 with members of Trump’s transition team to discuss whether the next administration would consider overturning any designation Obama made in the area.  The Antiquities Act “does not prohibit a president from abolishing or modifying the terms of a previously declared monument which has not been ratified by Congress,” Bishop said in a statement after the meeting. In a few instances, presidents have modified the size of monuments established by their predecessors: Woodrow Wilson slashed nearly half the acreage of Mount Olympus National Monument, which Theodore Roosevelt had established. But in 1938, the U. S. attorney general wrote a formal opinion saying the Antiquities Act authorized a president to establish a monument but did not grant a president the right to abolish one.     According to John Leshy, a former Interior solicitor general who now teaches at the University of California Hastings College of Law, neither the unilateral modification nor abolishment of a national monument “has been tested in court. ” Congress, though, can potentially do both of those things.  “We do not see that the Trump administration has authority to undo this,” Christy Goldfuss, managing director at the White House Council on Environmental Quality, said Wednesday. Only Franklin D. Roosevelt has used the Antiquities Act more than Obama. And the president is likely to either match Roosevelt’s record with a 30th designation, according to several individuals briefed on the White House’s plans, or possibly to exceed it by doing two more before leaving office Jan. 20.  Administration officials are eyeing an expansion of the California Coastal National Monument and Oregon’s   National Monument as well as the establishment of one monument in South Carolina and two in Alabama  to commemorate the Reconstruction and civil rights eras, respectively.  Yet given Republicans’ presidential and congressional victories last month, several proposals are likely to remain unrealized. Some activists are disappointed that Obama may not designate the Greater Grand Canyon Heritage National Monument, which would stretch more than a million acres and protect the area from new uranium mining. The monument has been supported by Native American tribes and, according to polling, a majority of Arizonans. But the state’s two GOP senators, John McCain and Jeff Flake, have opposed it, in part because of concerns it would prevent public access and complicate   efforts necessary to prevent wildfire hazards. Rep. Raúl M. Grijalva (Ariz.) the top Democrat on the Natural Resources Committee and supporter of the Grand Canyon designation, noted that Congress has considered more than a dozen pieces of legislation aimed at curtailing, restricting or eliminating the president’s authority under the Antiquities Act. Until now, the threat of an Obama veto effectively blocked those efforts. That won’t be the case going forward. “That battle will come. I don’t see it going away,” Grijalva said. And it will set up a key question for Trump: “How willing is this new president to give up power?”  "
142515,218017,Memo to Trump: There can be only one president at a time,Washington Post,Ruth Marcus,2016-12-28,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161229004018/https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/memo-to-trump-there-can-be-only-one-president-at-a-time/2016/12/28/753b1406-cd39-11e6-a747-d03044780a02_story.html
"," One of the hallmarks of our democratic system is its commitment to the peaceful transition of power. This practice comes with two important, linked corollaries that fall under the umbrella that there can be only one president at a time. The first is that the incoming president, especially in the arena of foreign policy, takes care not to trespass on the prerogatives of the incumbent. The second is that the outgoing president, once departed, remains largely mute, giving his successor space to operate unimpeded by   back seat carping.   Donald Trump must have missed this memo. Not bothering to wait for the constitutionally mandated handover, Trump has inserted himself into   from bullying U. S. manufacturers to barging into foreign affairs, including shaking up U. S.  policy and intruding into the Obama administration’s dealings with Israel at the United Nations.  This public tussling is as disturbing as it is unprecedented.  President Richard Nixon, at a news conference a week after being sworn in, was asked whether he would stick with judicial nominations submitted by his predecessor, Lyndon Johnson. Nixon noted that, in conversations as   with Johnson administration officials, he had “scrupulously followed the line that we have one president at a time, and that he must continue to be president until he leaves office on January 20. ” Bill Clinton   his presidency with this same point. “During the transition that is now beginning,” he said the day after his election in 1992, “I urge America’s friends and foes alike to recognize, as I do, that America has only one president at a time. ”  Eight years later, asked about his future plans as he prepared to leave office, Clinton invoked the   theme again, saying that he wanted to “find a way to be a useful citizen . . . but to do it in a way that does not get in the way of my successor. ”  As   Barack Obama employed the      mantra so frequently  —   10 times, by my count  —   that my colleague Dana Milbank was moved to poke fun at it. In the midst of a financial meltdown, Obama was assertively involved in lobbying for the auto bailout and in shaping the contours of a stimulus package that would be enacted on his watch.  But Obama  —   who had been criticized during the 2008 campaign for some of his dealings with foreign leaders  —   steered decidedly clear of weighing in on issues like the escalating crisis in the Gaza Strip. “We can’t have two administrations running foreign policy at the same time,” he said on Jan. 7. “We simply can’t do it. ”  Except Trump can. “At the end of the day, he’s not someone that’s going to sit back and wait,” Sean Spicer, the incoming White House press secretary, told CNN, defending Trump’s involvement with the United Nations vote.  Obama and his aides have, rather gently, made the   point. After Trump took a phone call with the president of Taiwan, Obama observed: “Since there’s only one president at a time, my advice to him has been that before he starts having a lot of interactions with foreign governments other than the usual courtesy calls, that he should want to have his full team in place. ”  Not only did the   fail to heed the message  —   he bristled at it. With typical Trumpian gall, he managed to take umbrage at Obama’s conduct during the transition. “Doing my best to disregard the many inflammatory President O statements and roadblocks,” Trump tweeted Wednesday morning. “Thought it was going to be a smooth transition  —   NOT!” Trump’s definition of a smooth transition: one that goes entirely his way. So what were these “inflammatory” statements that set Trump off? Just about anything can trigger his wrath. Perhaps it was Obama, at Pearl Harbor with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, exhorting Americans to “resist the urge to turn inward” or “to demonize those who are different. ” Perhaps it was Obama boasting he would have beaten Trump if allowed to run. Well, that’s certainly inflammatory. How dare Obama? Maybe Trump’s disrespectful conduct toward Obama shouldn’t be so surprising. After all, long before the election, Senate Republicans acted as if the Obama presidency had already ended, refusing even to consider his Supreme Court nominee.  In that sense, Trump is merely following an especially ugly,   party line. Imagine how President Trump, in office, would respond to such incursions on his authority  —   and how President Trump, on his way out, would deal with a successor behaving this churlishly.

142516,218018,"Melania Trump, First Amendment warrior?",Washington Post,Erik Wemple,2016-12-28,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161229004018/https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/wp/2016/12/28/melania-trump-first-amendment-warrior/
","     Not long before the presidential election, Melania Trump gave a rare public address in which she sketched out one of her causes as a potential first lady: “We have to find a better way to talk to each other, to disagree with each other, to respect each other. We must find better ways to honor and support the basic goodness of our children, especially on social media. It will be one of the main focuses of my work if I’m privileged enough to become your first lady,” she said. Thus launched an untold number of      comments. In an interview with   manager Kellyanne Conway, CNN’s Anderson Cooper referenced Donald Trump’s own habits on social media: “You know, the question is doesn’t this start at home,” Cooper said. “Isn’t the problem at her own dinner table?” Indeed it is: Over and over, Donald Trump has beamed nasty tweets  —   just search “donald trump twitter megyn kelly”  —   at whomever just so happened to be annoying him at any given moment. Now the National Enquirer is weighing in with some fresh reporting on the role of Melania Trump, just as the presidential transition is nearing its closing stages: “The ENQUIRER can reveal former model Melania will adopt a   platform as First Lady, including an unprecedented push to protect freedom of speech and a second campaign to eradicate cyberbullying!” The National Enquirer has close ties to Trump and was among the handful of publications to endorse him. A “source” tells the Enquirer of Melania Trump’s upbringing in Yugoslavia: “Melania grew up under a communist regime where citizens could not speak their minds  —   or be themselves  —   without fear or a knock on their door in the middle of the night. It’s what she loves the most about America  —   and it’s the issue she will make her own. ” Really? Though the Erik Wemple Blog is inclined to simply take the word of the National Enquirer  —   especially its October 2015 scoop that Hillary Clinton would be dead by April 2016  —   we decided to pat down this particular exclusive. Flacks for Team Trump didn’t respond to inquiries, though a knowledgeable source within Trump World didn’t contradict the Enquirer’s revelation. Instead, the source stressed the thematic proximity between cyberbullying and the defense of free speech  —   namely, that meanness on social media is protected speech, but that doesn’t mean it’s proper and constructive. “Just because you’re legally allowed to say something doesn’t mean you should,” says the source. There’s no telling how any of this may play out. Melania Trump is staying behind in New York with son Barron as Donald Trump moves south to occupy the White House. Ivanka Trump, meanwhile, appears poised to take on a    role in the Trump White House. “Anyone who tells you, with perfect confidence, what a Trump administration will do is either bluffing or a fool,” writes New York Times columnist Ross Douthat. In any case, a move to defend freedom of speech would mark a shift for Melania Trump, who has recently shown an appreciation for exploiting its limitations. With the assistance of attorney Charles Harder, Melania Trump has sued the Daily Mail and a septuagenarian blogger in Maryland for reporting about Melania Trump’s past. In a retraction, the Daily Mail wrote that it didn’t “intend to state or suggest that Mrs. Trump ever worked as an ‘escort’ or in the ‘sex business. ’” And the notion of Melania Trump as First Amendment warrior runs into further static in light of her reaction to a profile in GQ by reporter Julia Ioffe. Via traditional   reporting, Ioffe discovered a great deal about Melania Trump’s Slovenian past  —   a history that the subject didn’t want to see in daylight. So Melania Trump scolded over social media: The article published in GQ today is yet another example of the dishonest media and their disingenuous reporting. Julia Ioffe, a journalist who is looking to make a name for herself, clearly had an agenda when going after my family. There are numerous inaccuracies in this article including certain statements about my family and claims on personal matters. My parents are private citizens and should not be subject to Ms. Ioffe’s unfair scrutiny. Furthermore, the statement surrounding the performance of my skincare collection is completely false. The company in which I was involved with did not honor the contract and did not meet their obligations and as such the courts ruled in my favor. I am hopeful that the media will begin to cover me fairly and be respectful of my family’s privacy. Those are the words of someone who needs to post a retraction of her own before championing the First Amendment. And on this front, she has a soulmate in her husband, who has fantasized about an initiative to “open up” libel laws so that the Trumps of the world could more easily sue news outlets; blacklisted media outlets on the campaign trail; stood by as a campaign aide   reporters; and threatened to sue the New York Times for quite clearly accurate reporting. So when it comes to freedom of speech, perhaps Melania Trump and her husband should exercise their right to keep their mouths shut."

","Many Americans believe a lot of dumb, crazy, destructive, provably wrong stuff. Lately this is especially (though not exclusively) true of Donald Trump voters, according to a new survey. The survey, from the   was conducted in   and it finds that willingness to believe a given conspiracy theory is (surprise!) strongly related to whether that conspiracy theory supports one’s political preferences. Remember Pizzagate? That’s the bizarre theory that Hillary Clinton was helping run a child sex slave ring out of a D. C. pizza joint, as allegedly proven by code words in hacked Democratic emails. Lest you think this theory was espoused by only a handful of Internet nutjobs, observe that nearly half of Trump voters believe it’s true. This result is based on a poll conducted after a North Carolina man burst into the restaurant with an   rifle, leaving only when he was satisfied that no child   were harbored there.      About half of Trump voters also believe that President Obama was born in Kenya, even though their   candidate has since disavowed this conspiracy theory:    Source: The   poll, which surveyed 1, 376 U. S. adults between Dec.  . Numbers may not sum to 100 percent due to rounding.  Another conspiracy theory still held by the   is that millions of illegal votes were cast in the recent election. About 6 in 10 of his own voters agree with him. Surprisingly, about a quarter of Clinton voters agree, too.    Source: The   poll, which surveyed 1, 376 U. S. adults between Dec.  . Numbers may not sum to 100 percent due to rounding.  Trump voters are unlikely to buy the U. S. intelligence community’s assessment that Russia hacked Democratic emails in order to help elect Trump, a view widely held by Clinton voters:    Source: The   poll, which surveyed 1, 376 U. S. adults between Dec.  . Numbers may not sum to 100 percent due to rounding.  But on the other hand, about half of Clinton voters also believe that Russia tampered with vote tallies to help elect Trump, a theory that the Obama administration has repeatedly said there’s no evidence to support. This poll result is yet more proof that waning trust in the integrity of the democratic process is bipartisan, and that liberals should maybe keep any smug comments about paranoid,   Trumpkins in check.    Source: The   poll, which surveyed 1, 376 U. S. adults between Dec.  . Numbers may not sum to 100 percent due to rounding.  Alarming shares of both Trump and Clinton voters also believe that vaccines cause autism, despite the medical community’s reviews finding no connection (and the many outbreaks resulting from refusals to vaccinate children).    Source: The   poll, which surveyed 1, 376 U. S. adults between Dec.  . Numbers may not sum to 100 percent due to rounding.  Conspiracy theories are hardly the only arena in which Americans have proven themselves  . The same survey also found that, astonishingly, about a third of respondents believe the share of Americans without health insurance has risen in the last five years. Even a sizable chunk of Clinton voters (21 percent) believes this.    Source: The   poll, which surveyed 1, 376 U. S. adults between Dec.  . Numbers may not sum to 100 percent due to rounding.  In fact, the uninsured rate has fallen precipitously, and now stands at an   low. (This is true even when you look at only the   population.)    Source: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Health Statistics, National Health Interview Survey, 1997 —  June 2016, Family Core component.  Some of these misperceptions and false beliefs may seem laughable. To me, they’re terrifying. They result in misused resources, violence and harassment, health risks, bad policy, and, ultimately, the deterioration of democracy. Good governance becomes more challenging when Americans live in parallel universes of facts."
142518,218020,How awful was John Kerry’s speech on Israel?,Washington Post,Jennifer Rubin,2016-12-28,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161229004018/https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2016/12/28/how-awful-was-john-kerrys-speech-on-israel/
","     Secretary of State John F. Kerry’s dreadfully long and condescending speech rationalizing the U. S. decision to abstain from a   vote casting Israel as an international law breaker will convince no one not already in agreement with the Obama administration’s   posture. It will fortify the new Congress, the   (who tweeted before the speech: “We cannot continue to let Israel be treated with such total disdain and disrespect. They used to have a great friend in the U. S. but . . . not anymore. The beginning of the end was the horrible Iran deal, and now this (U. N.)! Stay strong Israel, January 20th is fast approaching”) and   groups to make a definitive break with this administration’s rhetoric and policy. How bad was it? Here are 10 reasons it was among the very worst foreign policy addresses in U. S. history (the others being some of President Obama’s and Kerry’s previous harangues): 1. Kerry continued to insist the explosion of settlement activity necessitated the action. Administration officials cite a “100, 000” person increase in population beyond the 1949 armistice lines. Rick Richman ably responds: The figure of 100, 000 sounds significant until you realize that 80 percent of it has been in the settlement blocs “everyone knows” Israel will retain in any conceivable peace agreement. The 20, 000 person increase east of the separation barrier, established to stop the wave of Palestinian mass murders against Israelis, translates into less than one percent of the population in the disputed territories, over a period of eight years.  It is ludicrous to argue that the settlements are an “obstacle to peace,” because they were not an obstacle to offering the Palestinians a state on three separate occasions: (a) in July 2000 at Camp David; (b) in the Clinton Parameters six months later; and (c) in the Olmert offer at the end of the   Annapolis Process in 2008. Each time, the Palestinians rejected a state on substantially all of the West Bank and Gaza with a capital in Jerusalem. Since then —  as Rhodes’ numbers show —  the vast majority of Israeli settlement activity has been within settlement blocs that no one can realistically expect Israel to dismantle. Israel already committed to a   settlement freeze with no reciprocal move by the Palestinians. Moreover, the vast number of additional units are within the confines of existing blocs pursuant to an agreement memorialized in an exchange of letters between President George W. Bush and Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon in 2004. 2. There is genocide occurring in Syria. Russia has invaded multiple countries. Iran is chiseling away on the JCPOA and seeking to destabilize multiple countries. Egypt and Turkey are engaged is an unprecedented crackdown on civil liberties. But in the final days of the administration, Kerry chose to single out our ally Israel. No wonder our friends do not trust us. 3. He revealed that the United States didn’t have the courage to vote for the resolution although it had a hand in it. He acknowledged telling other countries the United States would not block it if it was “balanced and fair. ” The resolution, incidentally, never required the Palestinians to recognize Israel as a Jewish state. 4. Kerry never addressed the role of Iran, Syria and others who fund Hamas and its attacks on civilians. 5. He blatantly cast Hamas (terrorism) as equivalent to home building for Jews, much of it in Israel and in Jewish blocs elsewhere “The truth is that trends on the ground  —   violence, terrorism, incitement, settlement expansion and the seemingly endless occupation  —   are combining to destroy hopes for peace on both sides, and increasingly cementing an irreversible   reality that most people do not actually want. ” This is moral idiocy. 6. He asserted that the Palestinian state must be contiguous. This raises the question whether he is demanding  some connective corridor between Gaza and the West Bank. This would be a new demand. 7. He hypocritically acknowledged only direct negotiations can solve the crisis. He and the resolution, however, do not demand, for example, Palestinians give up the right of return. He is either intentionally obtuse or lying about the resolution’s predetermination of key issues between the parties. 8. Kerry neglects to mention that Palestinians are not supportive according to recent polling of the steps needed to achieve peace: “A deal that would mark a final end to the conflict and an end to claims was supported by 64 percent of Israeli Jews, but only 40 percent of Palestinians. Making the new Palestinian state entirely demilitarized gets the backing of 61 percent of Israeli Jews but only 20 percent of Palestinians. ” The speech was designed to hold one party, Israel, responsible for the conflict. 9. The speech was pointless, simply an empty rhetorical jab designed to respond to criticism of the administration. 10. Kerry is very concerned about Israel’s democracy. If only he would spend as much time criticizing the Palestinian Authority for lack of elections, massive corruption and failure to establish viable civil institutions. "

","         Even before Donald Trump’s inauguration as president, Congress is planning to escalate the clash over the U. N. Security Council’s   resolution into a   conflict between the United States and the United Nations. If Trump embraces the strategy  —   and all signals indicate he will  —   the battle could become the Trump administration’s first confrontation with a major international organization, with consequential but largely unpredictable results. Immediately after the Obama administration abstained Friday from a vote to condemn Israeli settlements as illegal, which passed the Security Council by a vote of 14 to zero, Republicans and Democrats alike criticized both the United Nations and the U. S. government for allowing what Rep. Eliot Engel ( . Y.) called “a   biased resolution. ” Sen. Lindsey Graham ( . C.) the chairman of the Senate appropriations subcommittee for the State Department and foreign operations, pledged to lead an effort to withhold the U. S. funding that makes up 22 percent of the U. N.’s annual operating budget. “The U. N. has made it impossible for us to continue with business as usual,” Graham told me right after the vote. “Almost every Republican will feel like this is a betrayal of Israel and the only response that we have is the power of purse. ”       Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says Israel will reassess its ties with the United Nations following the Security Council vote calling for an end to Israeli settlement activity. (Reuters)   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, never shy about working with Republicans against the Obama administration, told Graham: “Please stand with us, it’s time to take the gloves off,” according to Graham. In the days since the vote, three Republican senators and their staffs have been working up options behind the scenes for how to convert their threat into action: Graham, Ted Cruz (Tex.) and Tom Cotton (Ark. ). They believe they will have support for quick Senate action from both Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell ( .) and incoming Minority Leader Chuck Schumer ( . Y.) a strong supporter of Israel. There are several options under consideration, two senior Senate aides working on the issue told me. Some are considered “micro” options, such as passing a resolution that would bar any funding that might go to implementing the   resolution. Other options include withdrawing the United States from U. N. organizations such as UNESCO or passing legislation to protect settlers who are American citizens and might be vulnerable to consequences of the resolution. Withholding U. S. contributions to the United Nations could be done in different ways. There are discretionary funds Congress can easily cut off, but the bulk of U. S. support is obligatory, mandated by treaties that Congress has ratified, making them de facto U. S. law. Depending on how drastic the funding cuts are to be, Congress may have to pass new legislation to undo some of the obligations. Senators are also looking at ways to withhold U. S. aid to the Palestinian Authority or perhaps punish the Palestine Liberation Organization representative office in Washington. Republicans in the Senate don’t plan to wait until Trump is actually in office; aides said to expect action as soon as senators return to Washington next week. “We will make a very strong attempt to do something immediately,” one senior GOP senate aide said. “It is a real moment to reexamine the relationship with the United Nations and what it really does. ” Not all involved agree on whether the effort is simply about pressuring the Security Council to reverse course on the settlements resolution, or to fundamentally challenge a broad range of U. N. practices and reorient the U. S. approach to the United Nations overall. Rick Santorum, who served in the Senate the last time the United States refused to pay its dues in full, told me that the coming crisis in U. S. . N. relations is the perfect chance for those who want to dismantle the organization altogether. “This has opened up the opportunity for those of us who are very  . N. who think the it has passed its prime, it’s not serving any really good purpose, it’s not helping legitimate governments around the world and it’s outlived its usefulness,” he said. “To the extent we can deconstruct it, the better. ” During the presidential campaign, most observers predicted that if elected, Trump would focus his   ire on NATO, which he often criticized as being obsolete and a burden on U. S. taxpayers. Now, Santorum said, the United Nations could be first up for action. “The focus will come off NATO and will move squarely onto the U. N.,” he said. “It’s going to be a very raucous time. Barack Obama, with this move, did more damage to the United Nations than he did to Israel. ” Some Republicans in Congress are comparing the coming U. S. response to the   resolution to the U. S. opposition in 1975 to a U. N. General Assembly resolution that equated Zionism with racism. U. S. Ambassador Daniel Patrick Moynihan led the U. S. opposition to that resolution and gave a famous speech defending the Jewish state from international persecution. That resolution was eventually repealed. Other Republican   experts see the coming battle as more akin to the effort by  . Jesse Helms ( . C.) to withhold portions of America’s U. N. dues in order to pressure the body into reforms. After years of tension, Helms eventually joined with  . Joe Biden ( .) to pass legislation restoring U. S. funding in exchange for a compromise on reforms.  President Clinton signed the   legislation, and the Clinton administration negotiated many but not all of the reforms with U. N. leadership. In January 2000, Helms became the first U. S. senator ever to speak directly to the U. N. Security Council, after the deal was struck. “The interests of the United States are better served by demanding reform and seeing that reform takes place than by removing our influence from the U. N.,” Helms said at the time. “It may surprise people to know that I advocate the reform of the United Nations, not its abolishment. ” Danielle Pletka, who served on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee staff under Helms, said the lesson of that episode is that taking on the United Nations can be done, but not without costs and the risk of retaliation. The United Nations could stop doing things that the United States sees as important. Allied countries that value U. N. operations will be upset if those programs are affected. Also, the dues don’t go just go away. “When you don’t pay, it’s like a mortgage, the bill just racks up. At the end of the day, we negotiated with the United Nations, but we paid a tax,” Pletka said. “This is a great opportunity for Donald Trump to show us he can negotiate the art of the deal. The Congress can give him leverage. ” There are signs that the Trump administration might be willing to make that deal. Its nominees for secretary of state and U. N. ambassador, Rex Tillerson and Nikki Haley, respectively have no ideological baggage on the issue. Trump himself tweeted that the United Nations “has such great potential but right now it is just a club for people to get together, talk and have a good time. So sad!” The Security Council’s   resolution has opened up a Pandora’s box in Washington, allowing anyone with a grievance against the world body to have their day in the sun. But most in Washington believe that despite the body’s problems, the United States is better off with a functioning United Nations and should seek as much influence there as possible. Congress and the Trump administration must be strategic and thoughtful as they chart out what seems to be an inevitable clash."

"," The Obama administration has informed Congress of its plans to resettle as many as 19 detainees held at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, in a final sprint to pare down the inmate population at the military prison, U. S. officials said. Even if the transfers occur before Jan. 20 as planned, about 40 inmates will remain at the facility, a lasting reminder of President Obama’s failure to deliver on his Inauguration Day promise to close the prison and an illustration of the difficulty of following through on one of his central national security goals. Obama’s inability to close Guantanamo after eight years in office empowers   Donald Trump to keep the prison operational. Trump has said he will make it part of his counterterrorism policy and “load it up with some bad dudes. ” The end to Obama’s Guantanamo plans also sets up a renewed debate over the proper handling of terrorism suspects and the legality of a system that was designed to interrogate and hold   suspects after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. “The bottom line is that the continuing existence of Guantanamo is a legal and moral blight,” said Hina Shamsi, director of the American Civil Liberties Union’s National Security Project. “It is the embodiment of U. S. violations of the rule of law, unfair trials and unlawful and indefinite detentions without charge or trial. ”  The   transfer plans, which would move a group of prisoners to the United Arab Emirates and additional inmates to Oman, Saudi Arabia and, possibly, Italy, culminates a flurry of resettlements that U. S. diplomats have negotiated in recent years. The planned transfers were first reported by the New York Times. Since Obama took office, the United States has repatriated or resettled 179 prisoners, helping to winnow the detainee population from a peak under President George W. Bush of more than 700 to 59 today. Early in his administration, Obama attempted to bring suspects to the United States for trial in the federal courts, but he abandoned those efforts in the face of stiff political resistance. Over the years, Congress has enacted tight restrictions on how and where prisoners can be resettled. Last winter, Obama made another appeal to Congress, asking them to set aside opposition andconsider a plan for wrapping up a   detention saga by bringing some inmates to the United States for imprisonment here. But legal experts and detainee advocates fault Obama for not pushing harder for closure, saying he could have skirted congressional obstacles if he had been willing to weather the political fallout. As Obama prepares to leave office, he leaves behind a military trial system so slow that five   suspects, including   mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, are not expected to be tried until 2020. Guantanamo also holds a group of “forever prisoners,” whom officials say they cannot release because of security risks but who also cannot be tried because of a lack of appropriate evidence. “History is going to judge him badly for his failure to close Guantanamo and particularly for his failure to do everything he has legal authority to do,” said J. Wells Dixon, a senior staff attorney at the Center for Constitutional Rights, which represents Guantanamo prisoners. Emily Horne, a White House spokeswoman, said the administration has continued to take “all possible steps” to move detainees out of Guantanamo and close the prison. “The continued operation of the Guantanamo Bay detention facility weakens our national security by draining resources, damaging our relationships with key allies and partners and emboldening violent extremists,” she said.  Some lawmakers continue to object even to transfers that arevetted by a panel of law enforcement, military and intelligence officials. Rep. Mac Thornberry ( .) chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, warned against additional transfers in a letter earlier this month to Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter, who signs off on each resettlement. “I am concerned that there has been insufficient due diligence prior to transfer, and that recipient nations have lacked the capability to enforce proper security measures to mitigate the risk of ” Thornberry wrote in the letter, a copy of which was seen by The Washington Post. While a small minority of released detainees have been found to have returned to militant activity, officials say the risks have been overblown. Although there are 23 prisoners approved for resettlement overseas, U. S. officials say they have no plans to transfer anyone beyond the 19 whose transfer has already been announced to Congress. Republicans have also found fault with the administration’s practice of keeping secret details of security arrangements for resettled detainees and information about U. S. financial support received by released prisoners.  Articulating the new optimism felt by critics of Obama’s approach, Rep. Edward R. Royce ( .) who chairs the House Foreign Affairs Committee, wrote this week that “on Jan. 20, we have an opportunity to chart a better way. ” While Trump has not spoken extensively about Guantanamo, he has criticized prisoner releases and identified the military prison as a “very safe place” to house suspected militants. “I want to make sure, 100 percent sure, that if we’re going to release people, number 1, they’re going to be people that can be released, and it’s going to be safe to release them,” Trump said in an interview with the Miami Herald. He also suggested that he would put new prisoners in Guantanamo, possibly even trying U. S. citizens there, a move prohibited by current U. S. law. The last time the United States added to the prisoner population at Guantanamo was in 2008, before Obama took office. A spokesman for the Trump transition team did not provide additional details on the incoming administration’s plans for the prison. Legal experts suggest that the continued detention of prisoners, without parallel efforts to resettle them, or efforts to bring new detainees to Guantanamo could be met with fresh legal challenges. Laura Pitter, senior national security counsel at Human Rights Watch, said that Trump’s apparent plans for the prison would feed into militant propaganda and weaken the United States’ ability to speak up for human rights worldwide. “A statement like that just shows . . . a lack of understanding of what Guantanamo means and the danger that keeping it open poses to U. S. national security,” she said. "

","     In his latest controversial statement, Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, known for his bloody   war that has killed thousands, threatened to throw corrupt officials out of a helicopter, saying he has done it before, to a kidnapper, and won’t hesitate to do so again. “I will pick you up in a helicopter to Manila, and I will throw you out on the way,” Duterte said in Tagalog in front of a crowd in the Camarines Sur province Tuesday, according to GMA News. “I’ve done it before. Why would I not do it again?” The Filipino president was visiting areas of the province in the northern island of Luzon that were recently affected by the deadly Typhoon   locally known as Nina. The storm, one of the strongest since Typhoon Haiyan ravaged the Philippines’ Visayas region in 2013, killed at least six people and displaced hundreds of thousands, according to the Philippine Star. In his speech, Duterte announced that he was going to give up to 100 million pesos in financial assistance, in addition to 1 billion pesos that was set aside for calamities, the Philippine Star reported. After that announcement, he went on to talk about his campaign against drugs and corruption.  The former mayor and prosecutor, who rose to power on a promise to uproot his country’s drug problem, has become famous for his brash talks and public outbursts. He made headlines in April, when he was campaigning for the presidency, for making a joke about an Australian minister who was   and killed in 1989 in a Davao prison. At that time, Duterte was mayor of the southern city of Davao. In August, he warned terrorists that he can be ”10 times” more brutal than the Islamic State. Most recently, Duterte admitted that he had personally killed people. He told a local radio station last month that he killed several criminals during his time as mayor. He specifically talked about killing three men who kidnapped and raped a Chinese girl in 1988, when he was only a few months into his term. He said that during the encounter, the men were holding carbines and didn’t raise their hands when they were told, so he shot them.      Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte says he personally patrolled the streets of Davao City on a motorcycle, looking for criminals to kill during his time as mayor of the city. (Reuters)   Vitaliano Aguirre II, Duterte’s justice secretary, cautioned that the president is prone to hyperbole and exaggeration, according to   News.  Following Duterte’s claims, the U. N. human rights chief, Zeid Ra’ad Al Hussein, urged the Philippines’ judicial branch to launch a murder investigation. “It should be unthinkable for any functioning judicial system not to launch investigative and judicial proceedings when someone has openly admitted being a killer,” Zeid said in a statement, adding, “The killings described by President Duterte also violate international law, including the right to life, freedom from violence and force, due process and fair trail, equal protection before the law, and innocence until proven guilty. ” Zeid also addressed Duterte’s   war, saying it has emboldened law enforcement to commit violence without accountability and is a “direct violation of all democratic safeguards that have been established to uphold justice and the rule of law. ” More than 6, 000 have been killed since Duterte took office on June 30. Some were killed during encounters with police who were acting under the government’s orders, while others were killed by unknown vigilantes.  Duterte defended his   campaign in an October interview with Al Jazeera. Killing criminals, he said, is not a crime. “It could not be negligence, because you have to save your life. It could not be recklessness, because you have to defend yourself,” he said. His goal, he said, is to eradicate his country’s massive drug problems “to preserve the interest of the next generation. ” “If you destroy my country, I’ll kill you. That’s a legitimate thing,” Duterte said. “If you destroy our young children, I will kill you. That is a very correct statement. ” Correction: An earlier version of this post said Typhoon Haiyan hit the Philippines in 2014. It was 2013.

142523,218025,Why punishing Democrats for their gun-control sit-in is dicey territory for Paul Ryan,Washington Post,Amber Phillips,2016-12-28,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161229004018/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/12/28/why-punishing-democrats-for-their-gun-control-sit-in-is-dicey-territory-for-paul-ryan/
","         For now, it seems, the one lasting impact of House Democrats’     on gun control this summer is Republicans’ desire to punish them for it. But figuring out a way to do that without fanning the flames of the gun control debate  —   not to mention angering gun control advocates who are more and more willing to fight fire with fire  —   could be politically tricky. House Speaker Paul D. Ryan ( .) has every incentive to make sure the minority party doesn’t ever again seize the floor. There’s no such thing as a filibuster in the House of Representatives; what happens on the House floor is supposed to be unilaterally within his team’s control, and for 26 hours in June, it wasn’t.  But any punitive measures Ryan takes could play into Democrats’ hands. Democrats have struggled to turn their   into any meaningful action. No   gun control legislation passed Congress this year. Democrats didn’t win big at the ballot box, either: They only gained six seats in the House despite expectations of up to 20 pickups, and Republicans kept their majorities in Congress and historically large majorities in state governments, too. Despite historic efforts by Democrats, gun control has largely faded from the national conversation. Until now. Democrats are practically begging Ryan to do something. No punishment had been doled out Tuesday, and already some Democrats were acting as if they had been punished. Here’s one of the leaders of the   Rep. Eric Swalwell ( .) on Monday:   . @HouseGOP wants to fine me, @RepBetoORourke & @RepScottPeters for filming #gunviolence  . I’ll always stand   victims. Bring. It. On.  —   Rep. Eric Swalwell (@RepSwalwell) December 26, 2016   No surprise, then, that Ryan has decided to go a more roundabout way that doesn’t directly lay the blame on any lawmaker. We learned Tuesday that one of the first things on his   list in January is to pass a rule authorizing the House’s top cop to levy a fine, up to $2, 500, on any lawmaker who shoots video or takes photos on the House floor. This rule would apply to future breaches of action and enforce already existing rules about having phones on the House floor (you’re not supposed to). ”These changes will help ensure that order and decorum are preserved in the House of Representatives so lawmakers can do the people’s work,” said his spokesperson, AshLee Strong. But here, too, Ryan finds himself potentially backing into a corner: Democrats could actually claim this more mundane procedural move is unconstitutional. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi’s ( .) office told Politico’s Rachael Bade they are looking into whether such a rule passes muster under the Constitution. Bade spoke with several constitutional experts who said that giving a House officer the power to punish lawmakers could be cause for concern. (A   interpretation of the Constitution is that only the full House, via a vote, has the authority to punish a lawmaker.) Ryan isn’t singling out any one lawmaker for martyrdom, but the tweets and releases from Democrats and gun control advocates write themselves: “Republicans are trying to unconstitutionally punish us for their efforts to keep guns out of the hands of criminals!” We should reiterate that you’re already not supposed to take pictures or shoot video on the House floor. In fact, you’re not even supposed to have your phone out on the House floor (though lawmakers frequently break that rule on an average day). Live streaming became House Democrats’ only option to broadcast their   since the   cameras cut off shortly after their protest began. (And no, Republicans didn’t directly cut the cord; the cameras are turned off as a matter of procedure when the House isn’t in session, and Democrats essentially forced the House out of session by seizing the floor.) The decision ended up being a great PR move for House Democrats. The shaky, grainy Periscope feed coming from lawmakers’ phones only heightened national interest in the  . As the   headed into   TV hours, the live stream was airing on nearly every major cable news channel. Ryan tried and failed several times to shut it down, with thousands on the Internet watching.      House Speaker Paul Ryan ( .) gaveled the House into session just after 10 p. m. on June 22, after a daylong   by Democratic members, but it was far from orderly. ( )   More than six months later, that chaotic moment feels like a distant memory. (Exit polling on how gun control factored into Americans’ vote is scant, but it’s notable the      candidate, Hillary Clinton, didn’t win.) Except here we are talking about it again. Ryan has every reason to want to punish lawmakers who seized the floor. But in trying to put an end to what happened, Ryan also risks reviving it again.   Dear @HouseGOP, you can fine me & @HouseDemocrats all the way into bankruptcy for #gunviolence   but we will always speak for victims.  —   Rep. Eric Swalwell (@RepSwalwell) December 26, 2016  "

","     A bit over 44 million Americans participate in the government’s Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, more commonly referred to as food stamps. That’s a higher number than in most years past, representing about 13. 7 percent of the U. S. population, but it’s down from the high of 47. 6 million in 2013, 14. 9 percent of the population that year. What’s incensing Fox News, though, is that 2016 saw a   level of fraud in the system, with $70 million wasted. The network hosted a discussion Tuesday morning with a simple conceit: Should the program therefore be ended? In December 2013, a poll conducted by United Technologies with the National Journal asked Americans whether they thought that changing the rules to limit food stamp availability should be approved, even if it kicked 4 million people off the support system.   of Americans said that was acceptable. How many would accept booting all 44 million isn’t clear. But it’s useful to consider the broader context of the question before we consider scrapping the program in its entirety. For example, the amount of fraud reported in the SNAP system is a tiny fraction of overall spending. The cost of providing nutritional assistance to those 44 million people (on average each month) is $70. 8 billion. In other words, the amount of fraud is about 0. 09 percent of all of the money spent. Visually, that looks like this.    (The Washington Post)  There is a slice representing the fraud in that graphic. It’s just not very big. There’s no question that fraud should be rooted out and eliminated, of course. There’s also no question that the $70 million at issue could have gone to more useful purposes. But in the scale of government waste, that $70 million is peanuts. In April, the Government Accountability Office, a nonpartisan investigative arm of Congress, compiled a report looking at places where the government could save money. It found billions and billions in potential savings in a variety of agencies and programs. The chart below isolates solely the proposals that would save a specific amount of at least $1 billion  —   expressed in $70 million increments.    (The Washington Post)  That’s one report. Earlier this month, The Washington Post revealed that the Defense Department had   recommendations that might save the agency up to $125 billion over the course of five years. “Pentagon leaders had requested the study to help make their enormous   bureaucracy more efficient and reinvest any savings in combat power,” our Craig Whitlock and Bob Woodward wrote. “But after the project documented far more wasteful spending than expected, senior defense officials moved swiftly to kill it by discrediting and suppressing the results. ” That’s a potential savings of $25 billion a year  —   357 times the amount of waste in the SNAP program.      The Pentagon has buried an internal study that exposed $125 billion in administrative waste, according to findings by The Washington Post. (Victoria   Washington Post)   Another example. On Wednesday, we reported about a   scam operated by Leonard Francis, a Navy contractor who, over the course of several years, defrauded the government to the tune of $35 million. As of writing, Fox News has not questioned whether we should disband the Navy."

","       YEKATERINBURG, Russia  —   It’s a stirring exhibition of Russia’s struggle to win rights and freedoms that the country no longer fully enjoys. It’s a shimmering memorial to a late president few Russians miss and an era most would rather forget. And although it’s overseen by the Kremlin, it’s also a tacit symbol of defiance to President Vladimir Putin’s authoritarian rule.  Not surprisingly, many influential people want to shut down, or at least tone down, the unbridled take on 1990s Russia that is on display at the Boris Yeltsin Presidential Center, a     archive and museum dedicated to the country’s first freely elected president. The drumbeat of disapproval has only gotten louder amid this month’s 25th anniversary of the most profound event in which Yeltsin played a leading role, also something most Russians wish had never happened: the dismantlement of the Soviet Union. In recent weeks, one of Russia’s   filmmakers lacerated the work of the center. The country’s Communist Party leader told parliament to close it. And a prominent mufti suggested that it might be better to blow it up. That last idea came from Ismail Berdiyev, a Muslim leader known for   positions and a member of Putin’s council on outreach to religious groups. Berdiyev said in an interview widely reported by Russian media that if it is found to be destructive to the state, “this center should be blown to hell. ” What has drawn the most ire is the first exhibit at the museum, nestled in a glistening building 900 miles east of Moscow, in Yekaterinburg, the capital of Yeltsin’s home region and the place where his career as a Soviet party boss took off in the late 1970s.  Visitors are shown an animated film that depicts the history of Russia as a   brutal and bloody effort by despots, monarchs and communists to crush rule by the people, for the people. The film concludes with the arrival of Yeltsin, whose leadership of the country up to and after the December 1991 Soviet collapse is hailed as the beginning of a new era of democracy and freedom.    Boris Yeltsin makes a speech from atop a tank in front of the Russian parliament building in Moscow on Aug. 19, 1991. (AP)      A portrait of Boris Yeltsin appears on a large screen at the center. (  of The Boris Yeltsin Presidential Center)     A visitor studies letters written by Yeltsin. (Courtesy of The Boris Yeltsin Presidential Center)    This treatment of history flies in the face of Putin’s efforts to create a national identity for Russians that smooths out the rough parts of a long and difficult past. Putin, whom Yeltsin named to replace him on Dec. 31, 1999, with the words “Take care of Russia,” has depicted his predecessor’s decade in office as an era of decline and ineffective leadership that played into the West’s   War strategy to keep Russia weak. To meet this perceived external threat, Putin has repudiated many of the political freedoms initiated by Yeltsin in the name of consolidating society. Putin, at the opening of the museum in November 2015, approved of the center as “an honest story of what was done in that difficult time. ”  Asked about the controversy during his annual news conference recently, Putin said the way history is treated raises questions, and that “it might be necessary to present some things more accurately. ” Russia has always had its battles between Westernizers and traditionalists, he said, but the debaters should not let their “passions get out of control. ”  This came after one of the Kremlin’s cheerleaders, the Russian actor and director Nikita Mikhalkov, sounded off about the center.  “Each day, the center is carrying out injections of destruction of people’s ” Mikhalkov proclaimed in an address to Russian legislators. Yeltsin’s widow, Naina, fired back, denouncing the criticism as “lies and insults,” and pointing out that Mikhalkov, who campaigned for Yeltsin in 1996, had never been to the museum. (He’s since been, and said he hated it even more now that he’s seen it.) She also took a shot at communist leader Gennady Zyuganov’s calls to close the museum, pointing out that seven decades of communist rule led Russia to the socioeconomic mess that occurred in 1991. The exhibits, divided into seven critical days in the decade, do not attempt to glorify that time or its protagonists. A country on the brink of total collapse and hunger, “shock therapy” reforms that led to the shutdown of industrial giants that employed millions of workers and the cream of the country’s scientists and engineers, the withholding of salaries, empty shelves, the shelling of parliament in 1993 and military campaigns in Chechnya from 1994 on, the questionably fair presidential elections of 1996, the infirmity of the president in his second term  —   all of these are on display, largely unvarnished and accompanied by striking visual and audio artifacts.  “It’s not just a museum of the first president, it’s really a museum of that period, of our country, of that history,” said Dina Sorokina, the museum director, in nearly flawless English honed while earning a master’s degree at New York University. “We do not necessarily avoid the sharp edges. ” No, they do not. Although the animated historical film at the beginning of the exhibit has attracted most of the negative attention from the museum’s critics, the most stunning moment comes at the end. On a bank of screens flashing the blue, red and white of the Russian tricolor, celebrities, athletes and politicians emphatically read out rights that are guaranteed in the country’s 1993 constitution  —   freedom of the press, freedom of assembly, the right to privacy  —   and that have been methodically eroded under Putin.  Despite this apparent open challenge to Putin, the museum received a glowing review from the   news agency.  An explanation can be found in the origins of the museum, which was established under a 2008 law stipulating the creation of presidential centers similar to the libraries that commemorate former U. S. presidents. Russia tapped Ralph Appelbaum Associates, which designed the museum exhibit space at  the William J. Clinton Presidential Center in Little Rock, to help design the Yeltsin Center. Under the law, the chairman of the board of the Yeltsin Center is  appointed by  the Kremlin, which creates an interesting historical novelty for Russia: Its current leaders are now charged with preserving the legacies of their predecessors.  Sorokina said that the museum had hosted about 250, 000 visitors since it opened. This is despite the continuing lack of popularity of Yeltsin, who died in 2007.  According to a poll by the Yuri Levada Analytical Center last December, just 14 percent of Russians saw the country’s first president as a positive figure. The Levada Center has published other polls that suggest that a majority of Russians regret the fall of the Soviet Union, think that it could have been avoided and feel as though the Yeltsin years brought more harm than good. That feeling is present even in Yekaterinburg, a closed city under Soviet rule (when it was called Sverdlovsk, after a Bolshevik leader) that benefited as much as any in Russia when the communist state collapsed.    “Freedom started here with Yeltsin,” said the city’s mayor, Yevgeny Roizman, 54. “This was a gray, closed city. When the city became open, everything changed. ” Roizman recalled more than 100, 000 people turning out for a rally in Yekaterinburg in August 1991, when Yeltsin famously stared down communist coup plotters from atop a tank in Moscow. That day used to be a cornerstone in the new Russian history. This year, the museum was one of the few institutions in the country to mark it.  “The old system was bankrupt,” Roizman said in an interview. “When the communists say how good it was, I say, ‘Don’t tell me fairy tales. I was there.’ ” Opponents of the museum counter that the exhibits skirt the truth. While it has an emotional display dedicated to Yeltsin’s final address on New Year’s Eve 1999, and plays up his distinction as that rare Russian ruler who voluntarily left office, the museum barely recognizes the powerful oligarchs who divided up Russia’s wealth while the nation suffered (perhaps because some are among prominent donors listed on a wall in the center). The calls to shut it down may involve political grandstanding by the likes of Mikhalkov, who thrived in the 1990s by making movies that never would have made it into Soviet theaters. But a petition on Change. org to close down the Yeltsin Center is accompanied by genuine expressions of pain. “My family also suffered from the [Soviet] collapse and its consequences, and we survived,” commented one of the signers, Marina Vasiliyeva. The museum and the respect it affords Yeltsin, she wrote, “spits in the face of ordinary people. ” Sorokina, 32, gets this. Her parents were scientists whose relatively comfortable Soviet lifestyle took a huge hit in the new Russia. She recalls her mother not being able to buy bread, and not being able to buy milk to bake bread. The family relied on her grandparents, who had a house in the country with a small farm. “It was a very difficult time,” Sorokina said. But it was worth it, she said, for “the opportunities we were able to gain, the new freedoms we fought for. ” Sorokina avoids openly criticizing the Putin administration. But she does not back down from what she considers her mission. “We are constantly under criticism, we are constantly under watch, we are constantly criticized,” she said. “But if we’re criticized, there must be something right that we are doing. ”       "

","     If 2015 was the year in which Germany opened its doors to refugees, 2016 was when the country pondered how to close them. Although the influx of refugees peaked more than a year ago, attacks like the one in Berlin on Dec. 19 have led to demands that Germany refuse entry to individuals without passports and step up deportations of criminals and terrorism suspects. Authorities hope that another trend will have a bigger effect in the short run: migrants deciding to go back because they are fed up with Germany or fear deportation. More than twice as many migrants departed the country voluntarily this year than were deported. Out of the 55, 000 migrants who left voluntarily, 15, 000 were Albanians. About 5, 000 each from Serbia, Iraq and Kosovo returned home. The numbers were first reported by Germany’s Sueddeutsche Zeitung newspaper. A spokesman for the migration ministry confirmed the numbers on Wednesday. Germany offers individuals or families willing to return to their countries of origin financial benefits that can amount to several thousands of euros, including travel costs and   grants. Promoted as an alternative to conventional development aid, such payments are supposed to help vitalize local economies and to prevent returnees and others from again fleeing to European Union nations. The German government will spend more than $155 million on additional development aid projects over the next three years in countries that are home to many of the migrants who head to Germany. Among the nations included are Morocco and Tunisia, as well as Kosovo, Serbia and Albania, all countries generally considered “safe” by German authorities.  Voluntary departures are unlikely to make up for Germany’s lagging efforts to deport more migrants, however. Out of the almost 900, 000 people who entered last year alone, many remain in the country despite being refused asylum.

(Daniel   via Getty Images)  German authorities say deportations are expensive and difficult to organize. Migrants are often arrested at night and later put on planes to their home countries. Pressure to change that process is increasing as more details are emerging about efforts to deport Anis Amri, who killed 12 people in the Dec. 19 market attack in Berlin. The fugitive was fatally shot by a police officer in Italy. Despite a criminal past, the    could not be deported to his home country of Tunisia for months because he lacked documents that the North African nation had failed to provide, according to German media reports.

Police think so — but Amazon won’t give up her data.,Washington Post,Amy B Wang,2016-12-28,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161229004018/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2016/12/28/can-alexa-help-solve-a-murder-police-think-so-but-amazon-wont-give-up-her-data/
","     When police responded to a home in Bentonville, Ark. one Sunday morning last November, they discovered Victor Collins’s dead body in the backyard. Police records describe a grim scene: Collins’s body was floating face up in a hot tub, and his left eye and lips dark and swollen. The resident who had called 911, James A. Bates, told police that he and a few work buddies, including Collins, had stayed up the night before watching football and drinking. Bates agreed to let two of them crash at his house, he told police, then went to bed. Shortly after he awoke, he claimed he spotted Collins’s lifeless body in the spa. Upon further investigation, however, police began suspecting foul play: Broken knobs and bottles, as well as blood spots around the tub, suggested there had been a struggle. A few days later, the Arkansas chief medical examiner ruled Collins’s death a homicide  —   and police obtained a search warrant for Bates’s home. Inside, detectives discovered a bevy of “smart home” devices, including a Nest thermometer, a Honeywell alarm system, a wireless weather monitoring system and an Amazon Echo. Police seized the Echo and served a warrant to Amazon, noting in the affidavit there was “reason to believe that Amazon. com is in possession of records related to a homicide investigation being conducted by the Bentonville Police Department. ” That warrant threw a wrinkle into what might have been a traditional murder investigation, as first reported by the Information, a news site that covers the technology industry. While police have long seized computers, cellphones and other electronics to investigate crimes, this case has raised fresh questions about privacy issues regarding devices like the Amazon Echo or the Google Home,   personal command centers that are constantly “listening. ” Namely, is there a difference in the reasonable expectation of privacy one should have when dealing with a device that is “always on” in one’s own home?  The Echo is equipped with seven microphones and responds to a “wake word,” most commonly “Alexa. ” When it detects the wake word, it begins streaming audio to the cloud, including a fraction of a second of audio before the wake word, according to the Amazon website. A recording and transcription of the audio is logged and stored in the Amazon Alexa app and must be manually deleted later. For instance, if you asked your Echo, “Alexa, what is the weather right now?” you could later go back to the app to find out exactly what time that question was asked. (Amazon makes the Echo, and Jeff Bezos is the chief executive of Amazon and owner of The Washington Post.) Police did not specify what data they expected to find on Bates’s Echo  —   nor is it clear what the device could have captured that would have been relevant to the case. Only if someone happened to have triggered his device with its wake word would it have begun recording any audio. Even then, it seems unlikely that audio would be conclusive evidence of an alleged murder. At least part of the search warrant indicated police may not have had a full understanding of how the Echo worked. “The Amazon Echo device is constantly listening for the ’wake’ command of ’Alexa’ or Amazon,’ and records any command, inquiry, or verbal gesture given after that point, or possibly at all times without the ’wake word’ being issued, which is uploaded to Amazon. com’s servers at a remote location,” the affidavit read in part. “It is believed that these records are retained by Amazon. com and that they are evidence related to the case under investigation. ” That allegation  —   that the Echo is possibly recording at all times without the “wake word” being issued  —   is incorrect, according to an Amazon spokesperson. The device is constantly listening but not recording, and nothing is streamed to or stored in the cloud without the wake word being detected.  Amazon, for its part, has refused to comply with the warrants, according to court records. A company spokeswoman said she could not comment on this specific case. “Amazon will not release customer information without a valid and binding legal demand properly served on us,” a company spokeswoman said in an email to The Post. “Amazon objects to overbroad or otherwise inappropriate demands as a matter of course. ” The case and its implications are reminiscent of one earlier this year, in which the FBI demanded Apple’s help in cracking an iPhone belonging to terrorists who opened fire at a work party last December and killed 14 people in San Bernardino, Calif. Apple refused to comply, and the FBI ended up paying professional hackers to crack the phone. As The Post’s Hayley Tsukayama reported in May: The ensuing debate drove a wedge between Silicon Valley and Washington, as the tech industry, already wary of government surveillance, rushed to rally behind Apple. Amazon joined Microsoft, Google and a dozen other tech firms when it filed a legal brief supporting Apple’s position in March. ”[The] government’s order to Apple exceeds the bounds of existing law and, when applied more broadly, will harm Americans’ security in the long run,” the filing said. In the midst of that public fight, Bezos said Amazon was among the many tech companies backing up Apple  —   and that they were embracing technology that would make it difficult for government officials to access any personal information on its devices, even when those authorities have a warrant. A Bentonville police spokesman did not return a call requesting comment Tuesday. Bates, who was charged with   murder, pleaded not guilty in April and has been out on bail, court records show. His trial is set to begin in 2017. Bates’s defense attorney, Kimberly Weber, told the Information she was alarmed by the police request of Amazon, which she viewed as an invasion of her client’s privacy. “You have an expectation of privacy in your home, and I have a big problem that law enforcement can use the technology that advances our quality of life against us,” Weber told the news site. Undeterred by Amazon’s refusal to turn over Bates’s Echo data, detectives sought the help of a far closer source: the Bentonville utilities department. According to police records, a city utility billing and collections manager told detectives that, on the night of Collins’s death, 140 gallons of water were used at Bates’s home between 1 and 3 a. m. an amount of water usage that exceeded all other periods there since October 2013. “In comparison, while all four [men] were together earlier that evening, they never used more than 10 gallons of water in an hour,” police reports said. “The amount of water used between   hours was consistent with spraying down the back patio area, which may have resulted in the wet concrete patterns observed on the morning of November 22nd. ” The utility department’s source? Each home in Bentonville was on a smart meter, police were told, to measure and record the exact consumption of electricity and water every hour.

142529,218037,Obama administration announces measures to punish Russia for 2016 election interference,Washington Post,Missy Ryan,2016-12-29,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161230000842/https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/obama-administration-announces-measures-to-punish-russia-for-2016-election-interference/2016/12/29/311db9d6-cdde-11e6-a87f-b917067331bb_story.html
"," The Obama administration announced sweeping new measures against Russia on Thursday in retaliation for what U. S. officials have characterized as interference in this fall’s presidential election, ordering the expulsion of Russian “intelligence operatives” and slapping new sanctions on state agencies and individuals suspected in the hacks of U. S. computer systems. The response, unveiled just weeks before President Obama leaves office, culminates months of internal debate over how to react to Russia’s   provocations. In recent months, the FBI and CIA have concluded that Russia intervened repeatedly in the 2016 election, leaking damaging information in an attempt to undermine the electoral process and help Donald Trump take the White House.  Because Thursday’s announcement is an executive action, it can be undone by the next administration. But Obama’s   measures put pressure on Trump, who has largely waved off the allegations against Russia, to make a decision about whether to keep the punitive measures in place. In a statement issued by his transition office late Thursday, Trump was noncommittal, saying, “It’s time for our country to move on to bigger and better things. ” “Nevertheless,” he said, “in the interest of our country and its great people, I will meet with leaders of the intelligence community next week in order to be updated on the facts of this situation. ”      (The Washington Post)   Taken together, the sanctions and expulsions announced Thursday were the most   U. S. response to Russian activities since the end of the Cold War, and the most specific related to Russian hacking. The administration also released a listing of addresses of computers linked to the Russian cyberattacks and samples of malware inserted into U. S. systems. Several lawmakers have called on the administration for months to respond, saying that tougher measures need to be taken to punish Russia. The White House resisted acting ahead of the election for fear of appearing partisan. Obama, who had promised a tough U. S. response, said the new actions were “a necessary and appropriate response to efforts to harm U. S. interests. ” He said Americans should be “alarmed” by an array of Russian moves, including interference in the election and harassment of U. S. diplomats overseas.  “Such activities have consequences,” the president said in a statement.  The new measures include sanctions on two Russian intelligence agencies, three companies that are believed to have provided support for government cyber operations, and four Russian cyber officials. The two agencies named are the GRU, Russia’s military spy service, and the FSB, the civilian spy agency that grew out of the KGB.  The administration has also ordered 35 Russian operatives to leave the United States and will shut down   facilities on Maryland’s Eastern Shore and on Long Island in New York believed to have been used for intelligence purposes.  State Department spokesperson Mark C. Toner said the diplomatic retaliation was partly a response to Russian provocations against American personnel in Russia, including “arbitrary police stops, physical  assault, and the broadcast on State TV of personal details about our personnel that put them at risk. ”       (Bastien   Washington Post)   In June, a senior U. S. diplomat was attacked by a Russian soldier at the doorway to the U. S. embassy as he tried to enter. That incident, circulated on video, resulted in the earlier expulsion of two Russian diplomats from Washington. The State Department also said that personal details about U. S. diplomats were publicly released in Moscow, and that the Russian government had refused to approve security upgrades to the U. S. diplomatic facility in St. Petersburg. Obama suggested Thursday that the United States may undertake covert activity in response to Russian activities. Officials gave no details. The Treasury Department also designated two Russian hackers, Evgeny Bogachev and Aleksey Belan, for criminal cyber activities involving U. S. firms and unrelated to the election hacks.  Moscow, which has denied involvement in attacks related to the election, vowed to respond in kind.  “I cannot say now what the response will be, although, as we know, there is no alternative here to the principle of reciprocity,” Russian presidential spokesman Dmitri Peskov said in a statement late Thursday evening carried by the Interfax news service. Peskov said the response would be authorized by President Vladimir Putin. In virtually all previous cases of Soviet or Russian diplomats declared persona non grata in this country, an equal number of U. S. officials have been expelled from Russia.   Trump has called on the Obama administration to present proof of Russian hacking. Speaking Thursday before the reprisal announcement, Sean Spicer, the incoming White House press secretary, said Trump’s views on the hacking allegations could change if more solid evidence emerges that Russia was responsible. “If the United States has clear proof of anyone interfering with our elections, we should make that known,” Spicer said, adding, “Right now we need to see further facts. ” Spicer also said that some on the political left were using the Russia allegations to downplay Trump’s victory at the polls on Nov. 8.  U. S. officials say they have been refining for months their assessment of the attacks, in which they say a Russian military intelligence agency hacked the Democratic National Committee and stole emails that were later released by WikiLeaks. Emails hacked from the account of John Podesta, who chaired Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign, also were made public. State electoral systems were also targeted, but administration officials said Thursday, as they have in the past, that they have no evidence the actual voting process was interfered with on Election Day.  While U. S. officials have not named Putin himself in the cyber meddling, Obama has suggested that approval came from the very top of the Russian government.  As part of the new measures, the administration has amended a 2015 executive order allowing the president to respond to foreign cyberattacks. That order was intended primarily for attacks against infrastructure or commercial targets, but officials adapted it to cover attempts to undermine the electoral process  —   not only in the United States but in other countries as well.  In a call with reporters, U. S. officials said they chose to announce the new measures before the end of Obama’s term in an attempt to educate Americans about Russian activities and to deter future intrusions. “There’s every reason to believe Russia will interfere with future U. S. elections and future elections around the world,” said one senior official, speaking on the condition of anonymity  because he was not authorized to speak on the record.  “The Russian actions have been sustained over an extended period of time, and by any definition are against the national interests of the United States, not the interests of President Obama. ” The harassment, the official said, “has been escalating steadily for some time” and is “a direct threat to the ability of the United States to conduct diplomacy. ” Both U. S. allies and American businesses were concerned about Russian activities, the official said, and “if [Trump transition officials] aren’t, then they should explain why. ” The Obama administration also released a document providing some details about the cyber operation U. S. officials have labeled “Grizzly Steppe,” including a list of names the hackers used.  These groups have conducted campaigns against think tanks, universities and corporations, as well as government agencies, according to the administration. In foreign countries, they have carried out damaging and disruptive cyberattacks, including on electrical utilities. John Carlin, former head of the Justice Department’s National Security Division, said the measures announced Thursday were significant. “It’s important to show that we can do attribution and are willing to impose a deterrent  —   not just for the Russians, but for the world, as we’re figuring out what the norms should be in cyberspace,” he said. “It’s not a world of free passes. ” Identifying the malware that was used, imposing sanctions and affecting the Russians’ ability to hack for intelligence purposes all “raise the cost” of conducting such activities, Carlin said. The Obama administration has already imposed sanctions on Russia for its activities in Ukraine, but those measures do not appear to have deterred Russia’s actions there.  Congressional Republicans welcomed the crackdown but said it was overdue. “It is an appropriate way to end eight years of failed policy with Russia,” House Speaker Paul D. Ryan ( .) said in a statement.  Sens. John McCain ( .) and Lindsey O. Graham ( . C.) said the measures were inadequate and promised to fight for stronger sanctions.  Despite the Obama administration’s efforts to deliver an   blow against Russia, Leonid Slutsky, chairman of the international affairs committee of the State Duma, the lower house of Russia’s parliament, suggested the measures would not inflict lasting damage.  “None of this will change the results of the election of the American president, and in January, the rightful owner of the White House will be Donald Trump,” Slutsky said. “I expect that with his arrival the dialogue between Russia and the United States will be conducted in a more healthy political atmosphere. ”  David Filipov and Andrew Roth in Moscow and John Wagner in Washington contributed to this report.

","       Donald Trump on Thursday played down the ramifications of any Russian interference in the U. S. election, saying it is “time for the country to move on to bigger and better things” in a statement issued just hours after President Obama announced sweeping sanctions against Moscow. Trump, who has for weeks voiced skepticism about Russia’s role in the hacking of Democratic email accounts and other hostile actions, said he would seek to learn more about the situation next week. “Nevertheless, in the interest of our country and its great people, I will meet with leaders of the intelligence community next week in order to be updated on the facts of this situation,” the   said in his statement.      The announcement culminates months of vigorous internal debate over whether and how to respond to Russia’s unprecedented   provocations, ranging from the hacks of the Democratic National Committee to the targeting of state electoral systems. (The Washington Post)    Trump’s posture put him at odds with Republican congressional leaders, who have condemned Russia for its actions, with some suggesting tougher measures than what Obama detailed Thursday afternoon. The president’s retaliation included the removal of 35 Russian government officials and sanctions against state agencies and individuals tied to the hacks. House Speaker Paul D. Ryan ( .) greeted the sanctions as an “overdue” gesture, while still jeering at the Obama administration over the timing, noting that the imposition of punitive measures was “an appropriate way to end eight years of failed policy with Russia. ” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell ( .) called the sanctions “a good initial step, however late in coming. ” He also hinted an interest in imposing more punitive measures against Russia if Congress’s investigation into allegations of   hacking yields further evidence, “to ensure that any attack against the United States is met with an overwhelming response,” he said.      The Post’s Karen DeYoung looks at the implications of the latest measures taken by the Obama administration against Russia and its interference in the U. S. election. (Bastien   Washington Post)   Several leading senators have already pledged to conduct such investigations in their committees next year, and some of them have already expressed an interest in slamming the Kremlin with stiffer restrictions. “We intend to lead the effort in the new Congress to impose stronger sanctions on Russia,” Sens. John McCain ( .) and Lindsey O. Graham ( . C.) wrote in a joint statement Thursday. Both chair panels that intend to probe the matter of Russian hacking next year. But no Republicans have expressed full confidence in the intelligence community’s assessment that the hacking that inspired Obama’s sanctions was done as part of a Kremlin plot to aid Trump’s chances of winning. The FBI and CIA have concluded that Russia intervened in the 2016 election in part to help Trump win the White House in his race against Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. The hacks targeted the Democratic National Committee and the account of Clinton’s campaign chairman, John Podesta, among others. Trump has suggested in recent weeks that the source of the hacks could be a range of other actors, including someone “sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds” or “some guy in his home in New Jersey. ” Speaking to reporters Wednesday night at his    resort in Palm Beach, Fla. Trump sought to distance himself from Obama’s expected punishment of Russia, saying, “I think we ought to get on with our lives. ”  During a conference call with reporters Thursday morning, Sean Spicer, the incoming White House press secretary, said Trump’s views could change if more solid evidence emerges that Russia was responsible. “If the United States has clear proof of anyone interfering with our elections, we should make that known,” Spicer said, adding: “Right now we need to see further facts. ” But Spicer said there is another aspect to the talk about Russia influencing the presidential election. “I think you have a lot of folks on the left who continue to undermine the legitimacy of his win and the nature of how big that win was,” Spicer said. He called that behavior “unfortunate. ” Later Thursday, in an interview with CNN, Spicer suggested that the DNC was partly to blame for being hacked. ”At some point, the question hasn’t even been asked of the [Democratic National Committee]: Did you take basic measures to protect the data that was on there?” said Spicer, who spoke shortly before the Obama administration announced its actions. ”Where’s the responsibility of them to protect their systems?”"

","  MOSCOW  —   The Kremlin on Friday issued a stark warning to the United States, saying it would respond in kind to the U. S. expulsion of 35 Russian diplomats and other sanctions following the Russian hacking of U. S. political parties before the 2016 presidential elections. “I cannot say now what the response will be, although, as we know, there is no alternative here to the principle of reciprocity,” said Russian presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov in a statement late Thursday reported by the Interfax news service. He said that Russian President Vladimir Putin would decide the exact response.  Peskov’s remarks were the culmination of a sharply worded reaction by Russia’s establishment to the sanctions, which come at a time when Moscow is looking forward to an improvement in its ties with the United States at the start of the Trump administration in three weeks.      (The Washington Post)   Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova, whose comments about the Obama administration have grown increasingly hostile as the relationship has soured, dismissed the White House as “a group of foreign policy losers, angry and ignorant. ” Zakharova’s colleague in the foreign ministry, Konstantin Dolgov, who holds the title of commissioner on democracy and human rights, called the U. S. sanctions “counterproductive” and cast them as having “the goal of damaging relations and complicating their restoration in the future. ” Whatever retaliation Moscow is considering will have to take into account the possibility that the Trump administration will want to restore the relationship that has foundered on differences over Syria, Russia’s annexation of Crimea, the Kremlin’s proxy war in Ukraine and the alleged hacking on behalf of    Donald Trump in the U. S. presidential campaign.  Peskov told reporters on Thursday that the steps showed President Obama’s “unpredictable and aggressive foreign policy. ” “Such steps of the U. S. administration that has three weeks left to work are aimed at two things: to further harm   ties, which are at a low point as it is, as well as, obviously, deal a blow on the foreign policy plans of the incoming administration of the  . ” Konstantin Kosachyov, a senior member of the upper house of the Russian parliament, suggested that Moscow will have to weigh its response given the possible reaction of the newly elected president. The sanctions, he said in comments carried by Interfax, represented not the will of the United States as a whole but “the agony of political corpses of the outgoing administration. ”   Putin holds a meeting with permanent members of Russia’s Security Council at the Kremlin in Moscow on Dec. 28. (Michael     via Getty Images)  That said, the history of diplomatic expulsions suggest that, at the least, Russia will throw out a similar number of U. S. Embassy personnel. Zakharova and others have long warned of an “asymmetrical” response to sanctions over the hacking allegations, so other expulsions are possible.  Putin repeatedly denied Russian involvement in the U. S. election despite the accusations from the White House, and the Kremlin has questioned the evidence for the claims. In his nationally broadcast marathon news conference last week, Putin borrowed some of Trump’s dismissive rhetoric, remarking about the hacking that, “Maybe it was someone lying on the couch who did it. ”  The Democratic Party, Putin said, is “losing on all fronts and looking elsewhere for things to blame. In my view, this, how shall I say it, degrades their own dignity. You have to know how to lose with dignity. ” U. S. analysts say Putin’s animus against Hillary Clinton are a likely explanation for the Kremlin’s desire to harm her campaign for the presidency, but contempt for Obama’s White House has also grown in recent months, after the administration shut down all contacts with the Kremlin. Putin in October issued a striking manifesto of changes he expected the United States to make, including reimbursement for Ukraine sanctions, as a precondition for restoring relations. More recently, Russia has pursued peace negotiations in Syria, culminating in a   deal Putin announced Thursday that pointedly excluded the Obama administration.  But the sanctions did not dampen expectations in Moscow that better times were soon to come.  “None of this will change the results of the election of the American president, and in January, the rightful owner of the White House will be Donald Trump,” said Leonid Slutsky, chairman of the international affairs committee of the Russian State Duma, the lower house of parliament. “I expect that with his arrival, the dialogue between Russia and the United States will be conducted in a more healthy political atmosphere. ”     "

","         On Thursday afternoon, the Obama administration announced its   retaliation for what has been characterized as Russian interference in November’s presidential election. Among the   measures, the White House announced that the State Department would be closing two   compounds  —   one in Maryland and one in New York  —   that it says were used by Russian personnel for   purposes. It is also declaring 35 Russians “persona non grata” for their alleged role in intelligence operations. How hidden were these alleged spy compounds? At least in the case of Maryland, the answer is simple: not very.  The compound in Maryland sits on around 45 acres of land at Pioneer Point, a peninsula where the Corsica and Chester rivers merge  —   around a   drive from downtown Washington, by the Eastern Shore town of Centreville in Queen Anne’s County.  The site was purchased by the Soviet government in 1972, and became something of a resort for Soviets living in the United States. It is the former estate of John J. Raskob, a former executive for DuPont and General Motors perhaps best known as the builder of the Empire State Building. The Soviets later added to the estate by making a deal with the State Department, which received two properties in Moscow in return. At the time of its purchase, there was some resistance to the sale of the building to the Soviets, with the local newspaper reporting there were “fears of nuclear submarines surfacing in the Chester River to pick up American secrets and defectors. ”     1969 photo of the Pioneer Point property near Centreville. (Baltimore Sun)  But by 1974, the New York Times reported that many locals had been won over, with the help of dinner parties and gifts of vodka and caviar. “As far as neighbors are concerned you couldn’t ask for better,” Joe Handley, a former estate manager for Raskob, told The Washington Post in 1979. “They don’t bother anybody. ” A reporter from the local Star Democrat newspaper in Easton visited the site in 1987  —   in large part because of the   rumors that it was being used for espionage. The resulting article, also published in The Post, noted the tall   fence outside the compound and the video cameras monitoring the gate, but also the   bungalows, swimming pools and numerous tennis courts. “Tomorrow we have a game,” one tennis player identified as Yevgeny told the reporter. “We have a tournament with the International Monetary Fund. They have a beautiful team. But this year, God knows who will win. ” After the turmoil of the collapse of the Soviet Union, Pioneer Point was bought by the Russian Federation  —   at the time, the Associated Press reported its value was $3 million. Local residents told the AP that they didn’t have any problems with the Russians who visited the compound. ’’I live down the road from them. We fish and crab with them. There’s usually one that speaks English for the group,’’ a woman named as Bonnie Delph told the AP. The compound has been in the news very little since then. Nine years ago, the Russian ambassador to the United States, Yuri Ushakov, invited a reporter from Washington Life magazine to tour the grounds, explaining that for him it was like the traditional Russian summer house, or dacha, he was used to back home. “Because we have such a hectic life in Washington, we need a place to hide for a while,” his wife, Svetlana, was quoted as saying. A man who answered the phone for a number listed online for the Pioneer Point compound said it was a wrong number, before adding that he did not speak English. On Thursday, U. S. officials would not confirm the location of the New York compound being shut down  —   saying only that it was a   property on Long Island that had been purchased by the Soviet government in 1954. However, a number of   bloggers pointed towards the Killenworth estate on Dosoris Lane in Glen Cove, which acts as the country home for Moscow’s delegation to the United Nations. The grand country house was once owned by American philanthropist George Dupont Pratt.      The announcement culminates months of vigorous internal debate over whether and how to respond to Russia’s unprecedented   provocations, ranging from the hacks of the Democratic National Committee to the targeting of state electoral systems.

","      “Arnold and Tim, if you’d come up, we’re going to give you a nice, beautiful check,” Donald Trump said. He held up an oversize check, the kind they give to people who win golf tournaments. It was for $100, 000. In the   corner the check said: “The Donald J. Trump Foundation. ” Along the bottom, it had the slogan of Trump’s presidential campaign: “Make America Great Again. ” This was in February. The beginning of it. Trump was in Waterloo, Iowa, for a   rally at the Five Sullivan Brothers Convention Center  —   named for five local siblings who had been assigned to the same Navy cruiser in World War II. They all died when the ship went down at Guadalcanal. Trump had stopped his rally to do something presidential candidates don’t normally do. He was giving away money. Arnold and Tim, whom he had called to the stage, were from a local veterans group. Although their big check had Trump’s name on it, it wasn’t actually Trump’s money. Instead, the cash had been raised from other donors a few days earlier, at a televised fundraiser that Trump had held while he skipped a GOP debate because of a feud with Fox News. Trump said he had raised $6 million that night, including a $1 million gift from his own pocket. Now Trump was giving it, a little at a time, to charities in the towns where he held campaign events. “See you in the White House,” one of the men said to Trump, leaving the stage with this check that married a nonprofit’s name and a campaign’s slogan. “He said, ‘We’ll see you in the White House,’ ” Trump repeated to the crowd. “That’s nice. ” After that, Trump lost Iowa. He won New Hampshire. Then he stopped giving away money.  But as far as I could tell, just over $1. 1 million had been given away. Far less than what Trump said he raised. And there was no sign of the $1 million Trump had promised from his own pocket.  So what happened to the rest of the money? It sounded like an easy question that the Trump campaign could answer quickly. I thought I’d be through with the story in a day or two. I was wrong.  That was the start of nine months of work for me, trying to dig up the truth about a part of Trump’s life that he wanted to keep secret. I didn’t understand  —   and I don’t think Trump understood, either  —   where that one check, and that one question, would lead.    I’ve been a reporter for The Washington Post since 2000, covering everything from homicide scenes in the District to Congress to the World Championship Muskrat Skinning Contest. (People race to see who skins a dead muskrat the fastest. There’s also a beauty pageant. Some women compete in both.) By the time I got to that Trump event in Waterloo, I’d been covering the 2016 presidential election for 13 months, since the last weeks of 2014. But I had the track record of a mummy’s curse: Just about every campaign I had touched was dead. I had, for instance, covered former New York governor George Pataki’s (failed) attempt to get people to recognize him in a New Hampshire Chipotle. Pataki dropped out. I read the collected works of former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee and made a list of everything the old Baptist preacher had ever condemned as immoral or untoward. The subjects of his condemnation ranged from   women going braless to dogs wearing clothes to Beyoncé. Huckabee condemned me. Then he dropped out, too. I went to St. Louis to write about a speech given by former Texas governor Rick Perry. In the middle of the speech, Perry dropped out.  So by the time the New Hampshire primaries were over, the candidates I had covered were kaput. I needed a new beat. While I pondered what that would be, I decided to do a short story about the money Trump had raised for veterans.  I wanted to chase down two suspicions I’d brought home with me from that event in Iowa. For one thing, I thought Trump might have broken the law by improperly mixing his foundation with his presidential campaign. I started calling experts. “I think it’s pretty clear that that’s over the line,” Marc S. Owens, the former longtime head of the Internal Revenue Service’s nonprofit division, told me when I called him. Then Owens kept talking, and the story started deflating. In theory, Owens said, nonprofit groups like the Trump Foundation are “absolutely prohibited” from participating or intervening in a political campaign. But, he said, if the IRS did investigate, it wouldn’t likely start until the Trump Foundation filed its paperwork for 2016. Which wouldn’t be until late 2017. Then an agent would open a case. There went 2018. Finally, Owens said, the IRS might take action: It might even take away the Trump Foundation’s   status. In 2019. Or maybe not ever. Owens doubted that the IRS  —   already under scrutiny from the   Congress after allegations it had given undue scrutiny to conservative groups  —   would ever pick a fight with Trump. “I don’t think anything’s going to happen” to Trump, Owens said. “But, theoretically, it could. ” My other suspicion was that Trump was still sitting on the bulk of the money he had raised for veterans  —   including the $1 million he had promised from himself. I asked Trump’s people to account for all this money. They didn’t. Then, finally, I got a call. “The money is fully spent,” Corey Lewandowski, then Trump’s campaign manager, told me in late May. “Mr. Trump’s money is fully spent. ” But, Lewandowski told me, the details of Trump’s $1 million in gifts were secret. He wouldn’t say which groups Trump had donated to. Or when. Or in what amounts. This was an important assertion  —   that Trump had delivered on a signature campaign promise  —   made without proof. I didn’t want to just take Lewandowksi’s word for it. So I tried to prove him right. I spent a day searching for Trump’s money on Twitter, asking vets’ organizations if they’d gotten any of it. I used Trump’s Twitter handle, @realdonaldtrump, because I wanted Trump to see me searching. Trump saw. The next night, he called me to say he had just then given away the $1 million, all in one swoop, to a nonprofit run by a friend. That meant when Lewandowski said Trump’s money was “fully spent,” it was actually still in Trump’s pocket. On the phone, I asked Trump: Would you really have given this money away if I hadn’t been asking about it?   “You know, you’re a nasty guy,” he said. “You’re really a nasty guy. ”      (McKenna   Washington Post)   A few days later, Trump held a news conference in Trump Tower, where he answered my other question. Where was the remainder of the money Trump had raised from other donors, four months earlier? Turns out, it had been sitting in the Trump Foundation, unspent. In this news conference, Trump announced that he had given the last of it away  —   and he lashed out at the media for asking him to account for the money.  “Instead of being like, ‘Thank you very much, Mr. Trump,’ or ‘Trump did a good job,’ everyone said : ‘Who got it? Who got it? Who got it?’ And you make me look very bad,” Trump said. “I have never received such bad publicity for doing such a good job. ” Because my stories had led to this angry moment, I was on “Morning Joe” and CNN and Lawrence O’Donnell. The New York Times and Le Monde referenced my work. My dad wrote to say how proud he was of me. I read pundits predicting that the presidential race itself would change. They said the old trope about Trump  —   that he was a Teflon candidate, immune to accountability  —   was now disproved.  When I came home from my last TV hit, the kids, ages 4 and 5 months, were asleep. The house was quiet. I was still full of caffeine and   energy and decided to tidy up. Among the clutter on the coffee table, I found my   ’s Party Popper, a bright yellow gun that fired confetti. For some reason, I held the gun up to my eye and looked down the barrel, the way Yosemite Sam always does.  It looked unloaded. Then, for some reason, I pulled the trigger. When I got to the ER, I had a swollen face,   confetti in my hair and a faint odor of gun smoke. Finally, the doctor could see me. “I shot myself in the eye with a glitter gun,” I said. I showed him the Party Popper, which I had brought with me, in case he wanted to send it off to the National Institute of Morons for further study.    I got home from the hospital with a scratched cornea and a tube of eye ointment. The next day, with some of my dignity permanently lost, I got started on a bigger story. The idea for this story had come from our executive editor, Marty Baron. One night, as we both waited for an elevator, Marty offered a suggestion. Why don’t you go beyond Trump’s promises to give to veterans, he said, and look at Trump’s giving to charity, period? The logic was that Trump had just tried to wiggle out of a charitable promise he’d made on national TV. What, Marty wondered, had he been doing before the campaign, when nobody was looking? That reporting process started with a lot of paper. Working with one of The Post’s ace researchers, Alice Crites, I went digging for records that would reveal Trump’s charitable giving, going back to his early days as a Manhattan developer in the 1980s. We looked at old news clippings, detailing Trump’s public statements. And we looked at tax filings from the Donald J. Trump Foundation, which had been dug out of storage by New York state. Those two sources told two very different stories. In the news clippings, you could see that Trump had repeatedly made public promises to donate to charity. In the 1980s, for instance, Trump had promised to give away $4 million from sales of his book “The Art of the Deal. ” In more recent years, he said he would give away $2. 5 million he made off “The Apprentice. ” And donated the profits from Trump University. All told, the pledges in those news clips made it seem that Trump had given away more than $12 million. In more recent clippings, in fact, Trump’s presidential campaign staff said his actual giving had been far higher than that: “tens of millions ” over his lifetime. The state’s records showed something else. They showed that the Trump Foundation  —   which Trump had set up to give away his own money  —   had received only a total of $5. 5 million from Trump since 1987.  So where was all that other money that he said he had been donating? “We want to keep them private. We want to keep them quiet,” Allen Weisselberg, the chief financial officer of Trump’s business, had told me about the missing money. “He doesn’t want other charities to see it. Then it becomes like a feeding frenzy. ” Once again, I didn’t want to take his word for it. So I set out  —   using Twitter  —   to try to prove Trump right. I started making a list of charities I thought were most likely to have received money from Trump’s own pocket. Nonprofits that had received donations from the Trump Foundation. Charities whose galas Trump had attended. Causes he’d praised on Twitter. In each case, I called the charity and asked if it had ever received a donation from Trump  —   and, if so, when. Then, I wrote the charity’s name and its response on a legal pad and posted pictures of the legal pad to Twitter. My list started to grow: 100 charities. 150. 200. In all those calls, a pattern began to emerge. In the years between 2008 and 2015  —   when Trump wasn’t giving money to the Trump Foundation  —   he didn’t seem to have given much to other people’s charities, either. The only gift I could find in that range was from 2009, when he was credited with giving less than $10, 000 to the Police Athletic League of New York City.      250 charities. As the circus of the 2016 campaign swirled around me  —   Twitter beefs, Trump’s criticisms of a Gold Star family and a Mexican American federal judge  —   I stayed focused on this small slice of Trump’s life. After a while, my    daughter started talking about the Trump Foundation at dinner, just because her parents talked about nothing else. “He should give the money to the people, so the people get the money,” she said. “It’s not nice. ”  I called 300 charities.  325. This story started to remind me of one of the weirdest stories I’ve ever done: a 2014 tale about the federal government’s giant paperwork cave. The cave was about 45 minutes north of Pittsburgh. The Office of Personnel Management kept federal employees’ personnel records in 28, 000 file cabinets inside the caverns of an abandoned limestone mine. There were 600 federal employees down there. Cave clerks. Their job was to assemble and collate paperwork from the caverns and use that paperwork to compute how much individual federal employees would receive in benefits when they retired. The cave clerks worked in an absurdist parody of government inefficiency, which was as slow in 2014 as it was in the 1970s.  In reporting jargon, I’d tried the front door: I asked to tour the mine. OPM said no. So then I went looking for windows. I sought out   who had firsthand knowledge of the place but weren’t beholden to OPM’s desire for secrecy. I found them. By piecing together their recollections, I got the story that the government didn’t want me to find.  Now Trump himself was the abandoned limestone mine.  If he wouldn’t tell me what he had given away, I’d try to find the answer anyway  —   by talking to charities with firsthand knowledge of what he had given. When I reached No. 325 on my list, I yanked on a window, and it gave.      (Peter Stevenson, Lee   Washington Post)   “They ended up purchasing a Michael Israel portrait of Donald Trump,” said Matthew Ladika, the CEO of a Florida children’s charity called HomeSafe. I had called this charity  —   which I knew had received $20, 000 from the Trump Foundation  —   to ask if it had ever received anything else, from Trump’s own pocket. It had not. But Ladika told me something I didn’t expect: the reason for that $20, 000 gift from Trump’s charity. Trump had used it to buy a portrait of himself. The portrait had been painted by a “speed painter,” who was the entertainment at a charity gala at Trump’s    Club. Melania Trump bought it for $20, 000. But then, later, Trump paid for it with a check from the Trump Foundation. That raised a new set of questions. Tax law prohibits “” which is when charity leaders use their nonprofits’ money to buy things for themselves. If Trump hung that portrait on the wall at one of his resorts, for instance, he’d be breaking the law. So where was the portrait now? I asked Trump’s people. They didn’t respond.  I tried a Google Images search, feeding it a photo of the portrait, which showed Trump’s painted face. “Best guess for this image: Orange,” Google said. I got a screen full of oranges. Orange juice. Orange Julius. No portraits. I kept looking, posting details of my search to Twitter. Soon I had attracted a virtual army, ready to join the scavenger hunt. I had begun the year with 4, 700 Twitter followers. By September I had more than 60, 000 and climbing fast. I began hearing from celebrities and even a few personal heroes, offering their assistance out of the blue. The barbecue columnist for Texas Monthly  —   an idol to me, as a journalist and a native Texan  —   was watching videos of other people’s parties taken at a Trump golf resort. He thought he’d spotted the painting in the background (he hadn’t). Kathy Griffin, the actress, called me with her memories about visiting the set of Trump’s “The Celebrity Apprentice. ” Mark Cuban, the Dallas Mavericks owner, was sending me links on Twitter, new leads on Trump promises. That army  —   almost all of them strangers to me  —   never found the first portrait. But soon there was a new target and a new scavenger hunt.  “Google ‘Havi Art Trump,’ ” said a strange voice on the phone one day, calling from the 561 area code. Palm Beach, Fla. I did. The Google search revealed a new portrait of Trump. This one was four feet tall, painted by Miami artist Havi Schanz. After a phone call, I confirmed that Trump had purchased it in 2014 at a charity auction run by the Unicorn Children’s Foundation. Once again, he had the Trump Foundation pay the bill. I needed to find that portrait. I turned to my Twitter followers, putting out a photo of the new $10, 000 portrait. That was at 10:34 a. m.      By early evening I knew where it was. “The Havi Painting was at Doral National in Miami, you can see two separate pics that tourists have taken of it,” wrote Allison Aguilar. I’ve never met Aguilar. I learned later that she is a former HR manager who is now a    mother in Atlanta, writing short stories on the side. Days before, looking for the $20, 000 portrait, she had scoured the website for Trump’s golf resort at Doral, in Florida, scanning more than 500   photos of the resort’s rooms, restaurants and golf course. About halfway through, she had spotted another portrait in a photo, hanging on a wall at the resort.  Then she saw my tweet, saying that I was now looking for that portrait, too. “Oh, now that I’ve seen,” Aguilar remembered thinking. The TripAdvisor photo she found was dated February 2016.  Was the portrait still there? The answer was provided by another stranger.  Enrique Acevedo, an anchor at the   network Univision, saw my tweet that night, broadcasting that Aguilar had traced the portrait to Doral. Acevedo realized that Doral was just a few blocks from the Univision studios. He booked a room for that night. “I used points,” Acevedo said. “I didn’t want to . .. spend any money on Trump’s property, so I used points. ” After his newscast ended, Acevedo checked in and started quizzing the   cleaning crews. “Have you seen this picture?” he asked. “They said, ‘Oh yeah, it’s downstairs.’ ” Bingo. Acevedo found the $10, 000 portrait, paid for with charity money, hanging on the wall of the resort’s sports bar. “Hey @Fahrenthold just checked and the portrait is still hanging at the Champions Lounge. How much did you say it cost the Trump Foundation?” he wrote on Twitter that night.     All of that  —   from my first request for help to Acevedo’s discovery  —   had taken less than 14 hours. Together, we had discovered Trump doing exactly what the law said he couldn’t do: using his charity’s money to decorate his resort. A Trump spokesman later offered the explanation that the resort was actually doing the foundation a favor, by storing its art free of charge. Tax experts were not impressed by this reasoning. “It’s hard to make an IRS auditor laugh,” one told me. “But this would do it. ”      On a morning in October, a month before Election Day, a window opened itself.  I got a phone call. It was a source, with a video.  The first few seconds were jumpy footage of a bus, lumbering through a bland Hollywood backlot. The soundtrack was indistinct mumbling. But then there was Trump’s voice. “I moved on her, actually. You know, she was down in Palm Beach. I moved on her. And I failed. I’ll admit it,” he was saying. “I did try and     her. She was married. ” That was 17 seconds in. On the bus were Trump and “Access Hollywood” host Billy Bush. The video, I figured out, had been shot in 2005. The two men were visiting the set of NBC’s “Days of Our Lives,” where Trump was to make a cameo appearance. In a blaze of network synergy, NBC’s “Access Hollywood” was there to see Trump arrive. Trump and Bush were wearing hot microphones. On the bus, Trump told Bush about trying and failing to seduce a woman in Palm Beach. (“I took her out furniture shopping,” he said.)  Trump also described how he kissed and groped women, without asking first.  “And when you’re a star, they let you do it!” Trump said. The thing that stood out to me was the genuine wonder in his voice. He seemed to be saying: I can’t believe it either, but the world lets you get away with this. This was not the first time Trump had been recorded having lewd conversations. BuzzFeed, in particular, had found tapes of Trump talking about women with shock jock Howard Stern. (“You could’ve gotten her, right? You could’ve nailed her,” Stern asked him once about Princess Diana, who at the time had recently died. “I think I could have,” Trump said.) But those had been excused, by some, because they were just words. Trump, it seemed, was playing an outrageous version of himself in public, for the entertainment of Stern and his audience.  But this video was different. This was Trump talking, in private, about his own conduct: how, when and why he groped women. It was not a story about words. It was about Trump’s actions, which these words revealed for the first time. I first made myself into Paul Revere of the cubicles, raising alarms around the newsroom and setting people in motion. The Post’s video team started to edit, transcribe and subtitle the footage. They told me they would be ready to post a version of the video at about 3:30 p. m. That was my deadline. I called NBC to see if they thought the video was a hoax. I reached out to a spokeswoman for Billy Bush and a publicist for Arianne Zucker, the   actress in the video who escorted Trump and Bush around the studio. And I reached out to Trump’s spokeswoman, Hope Hicks. I sent her the transcript of the video. I asked:  “1. )Does Mr. Trump have any reason to believe that it is not authentic, and that he did not say these things? 2. )Does Mr. Trump recall that conversation? If so, does he believe there is anything that was *not* captured in this transcript that would make him look better? 3. )Does Mr. Trump have any regrets about this conversation?” Nobody answered right away.  In the meantime, I had to start writing. The story was easy to compose, since much of it was simply repeating what Trump had said. The only problem was the bad words.  The Post is a fairly fusty place when it comes to profanity. If a reporter tries to get a bad word into a story, the word is usually forwarded to top editors, who consider it with the gravity and speed that the Vatican applies to candidates for sainthood. That unwieldy system assumed that bad words would attack one at a time, like bad guys in a   movie. But in this story, we were dealing with a whole army of bad words at once. The system was overloaded. When Trump said, “Grab ’em by the    ” for instance, the editors weren’t sure people would be able to guess right away what “    ” was. They added a letter at the end: “   . ”  Other words required a ruling from the bosses. “Go find out about ‘tits’!” I heard one editor tell another, while the story was being edited  —   Trump had used the word in criticizing a woman’s appearance. The second editor left to find a   editor who could make a ruling. “ ‘Tits’ is all right,” he said when he returned.  At this point, 3:30 p. m. was getting closer. We didn’t get any    response from NBC, Bush or Zucker.  Then we heard from Trump’s spokeswoman.  She’d read the transcript. She said: That doesn’t sound like Mr. Trump. She wanted to see the video. We sent it to them at 3:50 p. m. with a warning that we would publish the story soon  —   with or without their comment. Then nothing. Our lawyers and editors were satisfied that the tape was legitimate and newsworthy. The story was edited and ready to go. 4 p. m. arrived. Terri Rupar, the national digital editor, was walking to her desk to hit the button and publish it without comment from Trump.  I yelled for Terri to stop.  Trump was admitting it.  “This was locker room banter, a private conversation that took place many years ago. Bill Clinton has said far worse to me on the golf course  —   not even close. I apologize if anyone was offended,” he said in a statement that arrived at that moment.  The story published at 4:02 p. m. It became the   story of all time on The Post’s website, easily surpassing the past champion, a tale about a woman from Burundi who was believed dead but returned to crash her own funeral. At one point, more than 100, 000 people were simultaneously reading the story about the video. The servers that measure The Post’s Web traffic actually broke because there was too much traffic.  Afterward, Trump’s deficit in polling averages increased, from a little over 3 points to more than 5 points. Prominent Republicans turned to denounce him. House Speaker Paul D. Ryan ( .) said he was “sickened. ”  Trump’s running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, was whisked out of a campaign event  —   viewing a collection of autographed cardboard   buns in Toledo  —   without comment.  Trump himself made a second, more thorough apology in a   Facebook video later that evening. “I said it, I was wrong, and I apologize,” he said.   I had to buy another suit, for TV appearances. My daughter, now fully over the idea that her father was on TV, began complaining when I came on and she had to switch off “Peppa Pig. ” I had to quit doing the cooking at home. (Nobody complained about that.)  On Twitter I watched myself become a minor celebrity  —   all because of a story that had, essentially, fallen into my lap. “My wife says that David @Fahrenthold is a time traveler from the future trying to carefully fix the darkest timeline. I believe her,” wrote James Church  a professor at Austin Peay State University. And, after I appeared on Fox News Channel to talk about the story, I heard from a man in Milwaukee. He called The Post but couldn’t say “Fahrenthold” in a way that the   system recognized. He wound up in the   box of another reporter in Sports. “I wanna kill him,” the caller said of me. “Thank you. ” The Post took this seriously. I met with the D. C. police and the FBI, and a security consultant the paper hired. She was a congenial woman, a former counterterrorism official. When she arrived at our house she terrified us far more than the actual death threat had.  “Your cars are parked too far away for a car bomb,” she said, looking out the front windows at the street. “They’ll probably cut your brake lines. ” She recommended having a car patrol the neighborhood. She recommended a safe room.  She recommended stocking the safe room with provisions, in case we were under siege so long that we needed snacks.  I had to get back to work. My wife  —   who hadn’t complained about any of this, the long hours or the missed bedtimes or the   TV appearances  —   stopped me, shaken at what I’d gotten us into.  When the leaked Trump video still seemed to have swung the 2016 campaign, I was interviewed by a German reporter, who asked, “Do you have the feeling . .. ‘This is it, this is the peak of my career?’ ”    The point of my stories was not to defeat Trump. The point was to tell readers the facts about this man running for president. How reliable was he at keeping promises? How much moral responsibility did he feel to help those less fortunate than he? By the end of the election, I felt I’d done my job. My last big story about Trump started with an amazing anecdote, which came from a tip from a reader. In 1996, Trump had crashed a   ceremony for a charity opening a nursery school for children with AIDS. Trump, who had never donated to the charity, stole a seat onstage that had been saved for a big contributor.  He sat there through the whole ceremony, singing along with the choir of children as cameras snapped, and then left without giving a dime. “All of this is completely consistent with who Trump is,” Tony Schwartz, Trump’s   on his 1987 book “The Art of the Deal,” told me. “He’s a man who operates inside a tiny bubble that never extends beyond what he believes is his  . ”  “If your worldview is only you  —   if all you’re seeing is a mirror  —   then there’s nobody to give money to,” Schwartz said. “Except yourself. ”    Election Day came. I thought my time with Trump had come to an end.  That night, my job was to   the main Web story about the election. My colleague Matea Gold and I were supposed to   stories for all the likely outcomes. I volunteered to write the one that said “Trump wins. ”  Based on the polling data, it felt fantastical and pointless, like designing a Super Bowl ring for the Cleveland Browns. “Biggest upset of the modern era?” I asked Post political reporter Dan Balz, trying to use the right tone in this story that nobody would ever read. Balz said that was right. Then the polls started to close. And it turned out that I am not a time traveler. About 10 p. m. as the tide turned against Clinton, the editors started killing or reshaping stories they had assigned hours before. They axed CLINTON, a story about the history Clinton would make as the first woman to win the White House. They ordered a rewrite of GOP, which was supposed to tell readers how  —   with Trump defeated  —   the GOP was licking its wounds and looking ahead to 2020. Across the newsroom, paragraphs were being deleted en masse. An entire presupposed version of the future was disappearing. It wasn’t the future after all. Finally, at 2:32 a. m. the Associated Press called Wisconsin.  Trump was over the top.  “PUB TRUMP WINS STORY,” I wrote to the editors, giving the order to publish the story I’d written earlier. “Donald John Trump has been projected as the winner of the presidential election, according to the Associated Press. . .. His victory on Tuesday was the biggest surprise of the modern presidential era. . .. ”     (Jabin   Washington Post)   That night, I arrived home about 4 a. m. to a quiet house. I found a stale beer in the back of the fridge.  In the past, I’d always been able to step out of my job at times like this.  No matter how big the day’s story was, there was always a bigger world, which was still spinning unaffected by the murder I’d covered in Northeast Washington or the natural disaster or the congressional vote I’d just witnessed. But this story was too big to step out of.  As I sat on the couch with my nasty pale ale, it occurred to me that I would be living in the story, from that point on. A few days later, I was interviewed by another German reporter. He asked if these past nine months, the greatest ad ven ture in my life as a journalist, had been for naught. “Do you feel like your work perhaps did not matter at all?” he said. I didn’t feel like that.  It did matter. But, in an election as long and wild as this, a lot of other stories and other people mattered, too. I did my job. The voters did theirs. Now my job goes on. I’ll seek to cover Trump the president with the same vigor as I scrutinized Trump the candidate. And now I know how to do it.  David A. Fahrenthold is a Post staff writer.

","             Y ou can almost hear Carrie Fisher’s voice come down from on high: “Really, Mom? You had to upstage me one last time?” The instant memorials to Debbie Reynolds came   with the words “Hollywood legend” before her name. And she was a legend, for different reasons to different people. For one generation, she was the   teenage ingenue who, after being discovered at a Los Angeles beauty pageant, delivered her first big Hollywood star turn in the 1952 MGM musical “Singin’ in the Rain. ” To those same fans, she was party to one of the most notorious romantic scandals of the 1950s, when her husband, the pop singer Eddie Fisher, left her for their dear friend Elizabeth Taylor after Taylor’s husband, the producer Mike Todd, met an untimely death. (The couples had been such good friends that Reynolds and Fisher named their son Todd.)  To another generation, Reynolds was known as “Princess Leia’s mom,” Princess Leia having been played by Carrie Fisher in “Star Wars. ” And to another cohort still, she was assumed to be the inspiration for Fisher’s 1987 novel, “Postcards From the Edge,” a fictionalized memoir of Fisher’s recovery from a drug overdose. In the book, Reynolds’s character was mentioned only briefly (and not particularly negatively) but she loomed large in Fisher’s screenplay for the film adaptation, which starred Meryl Streep and Shirley MacLaine. In that version, Fisher’s mother was brash, bossy and sometimes breathtakingly inappropriate in her attempts to steal the spotlight from her far more painfully   daughter. Although the story was about a mother and daughter who were both actresses  —   and embroiled in the kind of pressure, competitiveness and endless psychodrama such a relationship might naturally entail  —   Fisher insisted that it was far more fiction than fact. Still, “Postcards From the Edge” captured what might have been the most enduring truth about Reynolds: She was a trouper. A   performer.

","     President Obama’s tenure has weakened America, wounded our alliances and bolstered our enemies. The president may have inherited some difficult circumstances, but he consistently misplayed his hand and made matters worse  —   everywhere. The Obama presidency opened in 2009 with an insult to Britain via the clumsy handling of the removal of Winston Churchill’s bust from the Oval Office, and it is concluding with an attempted destructive policy shift that is particularly harmful to America’s vital ally, Israel. In between, one secretary of state engineered a   pivot to Asia that no one in Asia noticed, demolished Libya and missed an opportunity to harness the potential of the Arab Spring. Another humiliated himself and the country by repeatedly allowing himself to be made a laughingstock by Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and by badgering Middle Eastern leaders long after he had worn out his welcome. To make matters worse, Obama has capitulated to and strengthened enemy regimes in Iran and Cuba. He scrambled our international priorities and declared global warming to be one of our most significant national security problems, requiring billions to be spent to lower carbon emissions in the United States at the expense of American businesses while giving China a pass. Obama refused to stand with the rest of the civilized world after the Charlie Hebdo terror attack in France and   destroyed the diplomatic tool of deterrence as one foe after another learned there were little or no consequences for ignoring the Obama administration. Am I wrong about any of this? Where is the United States stronger today as a result of Obama’s stewardship of American foreign policy? While it is mostly true that foreign policy and national security issues don’t drive votes, undoubtedly the feelings of insecurity and instability created by the Obama mismanagement of our foreign policy contributed to the Democrats’ defeat. And the bad politics of Obama’s national security policies has gotten worse for the Democrats because of the recent U. S. abstention from the U. N. vote against Israel. Even prominent elected Democrats are eager to distance themselves from the U. N. vote. I’m in California visiting with some Jewish friends who have a history of supporting both Republicans and Democrats, and they made the point to me that being   only gets you so much  —   but being   could begin to hasten the decoupling of American Jewish voters from the Democratic Party. One of my friends guessed that the amount of time it will take Samantha Powers, the U. S. ambassador to the U. N. to disclaim any responsibility for the U. N. vote after Obama leaves office is about “12 seconds. ” It will be hard for the Democrats who want to write books touting their service in the foreign policy realm during the Obama era. I suspect many officials who were planning to negotiate their book deals during the Clinton transition have canceled those plans. In the current environment, it will be difficult, if not impossible, to claim credit and success for any aspect of the Obama administration’s foreign policy. Assuming the liberals are wrong and he doesn’t actually cause a nuclear holocaust, I’m looking forward to   Donald Trump and his crew taking over. The United States needs to reassert itself. Say what you want about Trump, but I suspect he won’t be shy about asserting U. S. interests, and his Cabinet picks indicate that our national security is being returned to adult supervision."

","     To read a great work of fiction is to step inside the mind of another and see the world from an alien viewpoint. At a time when so many of us view our own countrymen with skepticism and disbelief  —   Hold on. No, scratch that. Sorry, I need to come at this another way. Let’s start with a plain admission. The beneficial effects of “the arts” have been vastly overstated by their proponents, typically artists themselves and university professors in arts and humanities disciplines. Usually their intent is to preserve or boost government funding for the arts, and it’s understandable that they should make such arguments. Those who’ve practiced and studied the arts  —   music, dance, visual art, literature, theater  —   want the rest of us to benefit as they have. The problem is that a) no one can agree on what “the arts” are or are not, and b) artistic genius emerges in humans and human culture far too haphazardly to be funded by government in an effective way. (Joseph Epstein wrote a wonderful essay on this topic in Commentary magazine in 1995  —   blessedly available online.) In their enthusiasm to keep the arts alive, many of their proponents have made foolish arguments in their favor  —   nowhere more so than on the subject of fictional literature. As a graduate student in literature, I heard it again and again: Reading fiction teaches you to empathize with others, and so prepares you for compassionate,   citizenship  —   or some such formulation. It sounds good, but the evidence is lacking. I can think of many people in my own experience who had read far more imaginative literature than I ever will but who had no more capacity for empathy than a   . Many of the most brilliant and widely read scholars in the field of literature (there is no call for naming names) were or are   beasts in their private lives. In fact, some of the 20th century’s worst criminals had read Tolstoy and Mann and Hugo. And yet. There is just enough truth in the maxim that fiction encourages empathy to stop us from throwing it out with the garbage. We should approach it with a high degree of caution  —   slowly and at an angle  —   but it’s surely the case that sometimes, under some circumstances and in some contexts, a great novel can give you a glimpse of what it’s like to see with the eyes of another, think with the mind of another. Some of us can name books that at one time in our lives had just that magical effect; I think of Ralph Ellison’s “Invisible Man” and V. S. Naipaul’s “A House for Mr. Biswas. ” At the present moment, though, when one half of America views the other half with antipathy and disbelief and disdain, Walter Scott’s first and probably greatest novel, “Waverley,” feels like the right thing to pick up. The book’s subtitle is ” ‘Tis Sixty Years Since”; when Scott began it in 1805  —   it wasn’t published till 1814  —   it had been six decades since the Jacobite Uprising of 1745. Nothing like it had ever been written  —   “Waverley” was the first historical novel  —   and its anonymous publication set the Scottish capital abuzz for months. “If the concealment of the authorship   …     was intended to make mystery heighten their effect, it completely succeeded,” recalled Henry Cockburn many years later. “The speculations and conjectures, and nods and winks, and predictions and assertions were endless, and occupied every company, and almost every two men who met and spoke on the street. ” In “Waverley” Scott wrote a perfect novel: subtle prose that only very rarely becomes heated or eloquent; a complex plot that brings itself together with barely any work on the reader’s part; and characters as complicated and absorbing as any in the real world. What makes the book so enduringly relevant, though, is Scott’s ability to find sense and decency and intelligence on both sides of a deadly struggle. The rebellion happened (the actual rebellion, I mean) when Scottish Jacobites, mainly from the Highlands, brought Charles Edward Stuart from France and attempted to overthrow the British monarch George II. (Historical background in one sentence: George was Britain’s second monarch from the House of Hanover, a line that had occupied the throne since the death of Anne in 1714, when the claims of the Stuarts were ignored  —   many in Parliament still remembered Charles II and the egregious James II and wanted no more Stuarts  —   in favor of descendants of the Electress Sophia of Hanover, per the Act of Settlement of 1701.) Briefly, the novel tells the story of the (fictional) Edward Waverley, an Englishman brought up in his Whig and   uncle’s house, although his father had been a hidebound Tory and furtive Jacobite. (Jacobite  —   Jacobus, Latin for James  —   is shorthand for those who supported a return of the Stuart line.) Edward, a soldier in the king’s army, is posted to Dundee, in Scotland, and more or less by accident falls in with the prepossessing and brilliant Highland chieftain Fergus  . Fergus, unbeknownst to Edward, is then planning to overthrow the government  —   creating a rather serious problem for the loyal English redcoat Edward, but through no fault of his own he is prevented from returning to his post and branded a deserter. In a short time, the     Englishman finds himself fighting alongside Jacobite insurrectionists. Through the character of Edward Waverley, Scott shows us the virtues and essential reasonableness of two sides implacably opposed to each other in an ancient conflict  —   each determined to defeat and ruin the other, so deep is their mutual loathing. The English and lowland Scottish Whigs valued modern education, progress and personal “improvement”; they could not understand what a lot of   backward agitators from a   part of the kingdom were so outraged about; they wanted only to destroy them and be done with it. The Highlanders, for their part, saw the Hanoverians’ devotion to peace and progress as weak, naive, unpatriotic and disloyal to the past. Somehow, as Scott shows us by the end of the book, they were both right  —   and both wrong. Maybe, with 2016 behind us, we can learn from that."
142537,218045,The real reason President Obama won’t recess-appoint Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court,Washington Post,Jonathan H. Adler,2016-12-29,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161230000842/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2016/12/29/the-real-reason-president-obama-wont-recess-appoint-merrick-garland-to-the-supreme-court/
","     Some progressive activists and commentators are understandably frustrated that the Senate refused to consider President Obama’s nomination of Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court. Some sued (making borderline frivolous claims). Others argued that Obama could simply appoint Garland without Senate consent. The problem, in both cases, is that the Senate has no constitutional obligation to consider a president’s nominees. While prior Senates largely used this power to withhold consent for lower court or executive branch nominees (leaving some judicial nominees in limbo even longer than Garland) there is no constitutional reason to treat a Supreme Court nomination differently. Since the election, some are advancing a new strategy to place Garland on the high court: a recess appointment. This idea was floated by David Dayen in New Republic in November and endorsed this week in New York magazine by Ed Kilgore. The problem with this idea, however, is that it is clearly precluded by Supreme Court precedent and, even were this not the case, would be entirely fruitless (although not for the reasons Dayen and Kilgore suggest).  Dayen and Kilgore suggest that Obama could   Garland to the Supreme Court (and other nominees to lower courts) on Jan. 3 during the short recess between the 114th and 115th Congresses. This intersession recess may be infinitesimally short  —   perhaps no longer than the time between two swings of a gavel  —   but (the theory goes) must exist as there must be some amount of time between the end of one session and the start of the next. The idea here is not new. President Theodore Roosevelt used this intersession recess to make numerous recess appointments in 1903. The practice was never repeated, however, and the theory upon which TR’s actions were based were largely disavowed by subsequent administrations. But that’s hardly the only problem with an intersession recess appointment. The real problem with trying to make such an intersession recess appointment is that the Supreme Court has held that such an appointment would be unconstitutional in Noel Canning v. NLRB. Dayen and Kilgore purport to address Noel Canning  —   claiming it does not apply since the case concerned only intrasession recess appointments  —   but they ignore what Justice Breyer’s opinion for the court actually says. As Seth Barrett Tillman points out, Noel Canning clearly precludes such an appointment. From Justice Breyer’s opinion: we conclude that the phrase “the recess” applies to both   and   recesses. If a Senate recess is so short [i. e. less than 3 days] that it does not require the consent of the House, it is too short to trigger the Recess Appointments Clause. See Art. I, § 5, cl. 4. And a recess lasting less than 10 days is presumptively too short as well. If a   recess is too short, a   recess would certainly be as well and, contrary to Dayen’s and Kilgore’s suggestion, Justice Breyer’s opinion makes no distinction between intrasession and intersession recesses. All told, every justice on the court embraced an opinion rejecting the idea that such an intersession recess appointment would be constitutional.  The problems with the Dayen and Kilgore gambit do not end there, however. Such an appointment, even if attempted, would be futile, but not for the reasons they suggest. Kilgore says a Garland recess appointment could be nixed only by a Senate vote to reject Garland’s nomination  —   giving him the vote Democrats have called for  —   or through “extensive litigation. ” He’s wrong on both counts. A vote against Garland’s confirmation would not undo a recess appointment, and litigation, “extensive” or otherwise, would not be necessary to remove Garland from the bench. Dayen rightly notes that it would be difficult to quickly arrange a lawsuit to challenge the constitutionality of Garland’s appointment (though such suits have been brought before). Yet such a suit would not be required. All that the Senate would need to do is end its next session by adjourning sine die and Garland’s term would end. This is because, under the Constitution’s Recess Appointments Clause, such appointments terminate at the end of the next Senate session. Adjourning sine die would require the cooperation of the House and a president’s signature, but that would be no obstacle come Jan. 20. In other words, Congress could terminate any recess appointment made by Obama in less than three weeks. Kilgore concludes: None of this is likely to happen, in part because Barack Obama isn’t built that way, and in part because Democrats might fear the gesture would distract attention from the terrible things the new Trump administration and its congressional allies are trying to do to the country on many fronts. No. The real reason this is unlikely to happen is that it would be unlawful and unavailing  —   and there is virtually no chance that someone of Garland’s character would participate in such a gambit. Update: I should have added that another reason this won’t happen is that   Garland to the Supreme Court would create a vacancy on the U. S. Court of Appeals for the D. C. Circuit that could then be filled by President Trump."

","2016 was a bumpy year, and The Post’s editorial board commented on many of the ups and downs. The board responded to events around the world  —   from the attack at Orlando’s Pulse nightclub that killed 49 to the United Kingdom’s “Brexit” from the European Union to the death of Cuba’s Fidel Castro  —   and argued for political and policy changes at home and abroad. Here are 10 of the topics that, in The Post’s view, mattered most this year.      The   change The editorial board called 2015 “a year of progress and buffoonery on climate change,” and 2016 wasn’t much different. The Paris emissions agreement went into effect, but study after study showed the damage that warming has already done  —   and continues to do  —   to the planet. And the nomination of a man who rejects settled science to lead the Environmental Protection Agency does not bode well for the years to come. “In the world of facts, evidence and science, the dangers of climate change look ever more frightening. ”    Syrian workers remove rubble on December 27 from a water station in an Aleppo neighborhood. (George     via Getty Images  Aleppo The battle for Aleppo raged over the course of 2016, and the United States, in the editorial board’s view, did little more than hem and haw as the city burned and civilians were slaughtered. The year ended with Aleppo in ruins  —   and the United States’ moral authority in no better shape. “Above all, Aleppo represents a meltdown of the West’s moral and political will  —   and in particular, a collapse of U. S. leadership. ”    Handbills in Hong Kong protesting the detention of a city bookseller, Lam  . (Anthony     via Getty Images)  Democracy’s worldwide retreat The editorial board chronicled  —   and criticized  —   the rollback of human rights around the world, from China’s imprisonment of booksellers and lawyers to autocrat Rodrigo Duterte’s rise in the Philippines to Russia’s toxic propaganda at home and abroad. “Liberal values such as transparency, rule of law, accountability and respect for human dignity are being widely trampled. Autocrats and even some Western politicians openly traffic in fear, xenophobia and paranoia. The enemies of democracy are growing bolder by the day. The United States is partly responsible for letting this happen. ”    Messages are written on a couch at a memorial down the road from the Pulse nightclub in Orlando. (Spencer   Images)  Gun violence We saw more mass shootings in 2016, and the June massacre at a gay nightclub in Orlando marked the deadliest attack on U. S. soil since Sept. 11, 2001. The editorial board has called for action to limit access to guns  —   but Congress has remained in gridlock over the issue. “The United States loses far more people to gun violence  —   homicidal, suicidal, accidental  —   than almost any other country, and there is one reason: the easy availability of guns. Other countries struggle with mental illness. In other countries, teenagers play violent video games.   …     Those may be interesting issues. But it is guns that make the difference. ”    Delegates hold signs against the   Partnership during the Democratic National Convention. (Andrew   News)  Trade The   Partnership was one casualty in the 2016 presidential race, much to the editorial board’s dismay. Though the board began the year advocating the agreement’s congressional approval, the chances of ratification began to look slimmer and slimmer. Eventually, both   candidates had disavowed the deal, prompting the board to ask: If not TPP, then what? “Threats to democracy and prosperity include not only Chinese provocations but also North Korean bellicosity and the errant leadership of Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte. The TPP was to be the anchor, symbolic and substantive, of a reinvigorated U. S. presence. ”    A Silver Line Metro train pulls into the Ballston Metro station. (Pete Marovich for The Washington Post)  Metro Metro is a mess. This year saw the start of the maintenance surge known as SafeTrack  —   and with that came massive shutdowns, calls for more and more money and a debate over canceling   service. The only solution? A federal takeover, before the next catastrophe strikes. “The system that is supposed to serve the growing population of the national capital region is instead a national embarrassment, an amateur operation that has been terribly managed and (we think, but at this point who can believe Metro’s books?) financially shortchanged. ”    The flag of the District of Columbia and the American flag. (Jonathan   Washington Post)  D. C. rights The editorial board took up the D. C. rights cause long before 2016, but a new offensive this year by local officials to give District denizens voting representation in Congress was reason to keep fighting. In November, residents overwhelmingly approved a ballot referendum indicating that they wanted to make the city the 51st state  —   a choice the board hoped would put pressure on Congress to grant D. C. a greater degree of  . “The 672, 000 (and climbing) residents of the District pay taxes, volunteer for military duty and fulfill other obligations of citizenship, but they have no voting representation in Congress. That is just wrong. ”    Judge Merrick Garland arrives at the White House. (Jonathan  )  Merrick Garland The board greeted Merrick Garland’s nomination to the Supreme Court by laying out the case against him: “Well, there is not much of a case against him. ” It urged the GOP to stop playing politics and give Garland a hearing and a vote  —   especially as the need for a ninth justice became even more and more evident. But the GOP, as the board eventually had to admit, paid no political price for its dishonorable gamble. “Elections are supposed to provide regular and orderly guidance to government, not shut it down for months at a time. The only workable principle is that politicians be allowed  —   indeed, expected  —   to do their jobs for as long as the country has hired them. ”    Hillary Clinton speaks to journalists during an October news conference to comment on the new FBI investigation concerning her private email server. (Melina   Washington Post)  Hillary Clinton’s emails When news first broke that emails on Hillary Clinton’s private server included “top secret” information, the editorial board called on the FBI for the speedy release of information that would let voters know “whether this was a lapse of judgment or something worse. ” When FBI Director James B. Comey provided that information, the board lambasted Clinton for her carelessness but noted it was “not a crime. ” From there, the board thought the attention paid to the scandal started to spiral “out of control”  —   to the country’s detriment. “Imagine how history would judge today’s Americans if, looking back at this election, the record showed that voters empowered a dangerous man because of . . . a minor email scandal. ”      Donald Trump. (Lucas  )  Donald Trump Donald Trump gave the editorial board a lot to talk about in 2016, whether he was refusing to release his tax returns, threatening to jail the opposition or winning the U. S. presidential election. In July after the Republican National Convention, the board proclaimed Trump “a unique threat to American democracy. ” In October, it chronicled the damage a President Trump could do to the country in areas of importance from domestic immigration policy to the world economy. In November, Mr. Trump was elected president  —   ensuring there will still be plenty for the board to write about in 2017. “Americans are not and have never been united by blood or creed, but by allegiance to a democratic system of government that shares power, cherishes the rule of law and respects the dignity of individuals. We hope our newly elected president will show respect for that system. Americans must stand ready to support him if he does, and to support the system whether he does or does not. ”"

","     John Yearwood, who has reported extensively on Africa, is the former world editor of the Miami Herald. On Twitter, @john_yearwood. On a recent visit to New York City, I looked down from a subway overpass on a fight between two men. The shorter of the two pummeled his opponent, who raced across a busy intersection to escape the blows. Then a surprise: He stopped, stiffened his back, rolled up his sleeves and challenged his attacker to come get him. The short guy, suddenly fearing the worse, turned and ran away crying. That scene has been on repeat in my mind as I follow recent developments involving a diminutive thug in West Africa: Gambian leader Yahya Jammeh. On Dec. 1, a massive number of Gambians went to the polls in elections that African Union observers hailed as “orderly, peaceful and really serene. ” They voted for businessman Adama Barrow, who represented the opposition Independent Coalition of Parties. Jammeh has ruled Gambia for the past 22 years, after staging a coup at the age of 29. Despite a despotic past, Jammeh was regarded as a statesman when he said after the results were announced that he accepted the will of the people and will step aside when his term ends Jan. 19. In a stunning reversal a few days later, Jammeh, one of Africa’s few remaining strongmen, announced his change of heart. The elections, he declared, were tainted by “unacceptable abnormalities. ” He ordered the military to seal off the election offices and removed election officials from their posts. How African leaders handle this crisis could determine whether the continent continues on a path toward further political pluralism or surrender to the rule of the malevolent dictator. A team of presidents from the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) flew into the capital of Banjul to plead with Jammeh to cede power, including Muhammadu Buhari of Nigeria, outgoing president John Mahama of Ghana and President Ernest Bai Koroma of Sierra Leone. Photos from the meeting gave a good sense of how it went: Jammeh, in his trademark white flowing robe, was the only one smiling. Exiting State House, Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, who led the delegation, looked like she had been sickened by the encounter. Jammeh has held his ground, going on national television Dec. 20 to reiterate that he was “annulling the elections” because not all registered voters cast a ballot, and he gave a tortured explanation of polling figures. He then blasted the West for interfering in Gambia’s internal affairs. He also took on ECOWAS, condemning the organization for its “intervention into the internal affairs of the country as a sovereign state. ” French President Francois Hollande has said that Barrow “must be installed as soon as possible. ” The United States, the European Union and the U. N. Security Council have called for the will of the people to be respected. Even Jammeh’s own U. S. ambassador has abandoned him, saying his boss has “put The Gambia on a dangerous path. ” West Africa, indeed Africa, is at a critical intersection. The continent’s presidents have too often protected autocratic members of their leadership clique to stifle any wind of change blowing from their people. ECOWAS, which has taken the lead in Gambia mediation, has said it will take “all necessary action to enforce the results” of the election. The president of ECOWAS said that the economic bloc is prepared to dispatch troops from Senegal to remove Jammeh if he stays beyond Jan. 19. That’s a good move but not the only one that should be played. The African Union should make it clear now that Jammeh will not be welcomed when heads of state gather for the A. U. summit in Addis Ababa at the end of January. He needs to get the clear message that he has become persona non grata on the continent. ECOWAS and other African leaders should realize by now that Jammeh is nothing but a thug, whose sole goal is to bully his people and the international community. Allowing him to remain in office beyond Jan. 19 would send a strong message that elections are meaningless as more and more Africans cry out for electoral change. Many on the continent who run for office or even participate in elections at high personal risks will no doubt question why bother at all to get involved. That is not the message that ECOWAS or the African Union wants to send. There have been some victories for democracy, such as in Ghana and Senegal, when losing presidents announced after results were released their intentions to step aside  —   and kept their word. It stains the fabric of an Africa enjoying economic and democratic gains to be held hostage by a thug from the tiniest country on the African mainland. It’s time for ECOWAS, the E. U. and other leaders on the continent to stiffen their backs and roll up their sleeves. Jammeh, like the New York City bully, is sure to scurry in the other direction."

","     Our greatest fear for 2017 and the Trump presidency is not that he will behave irrationally, impulsively and selfishly (e. g. refusing to sell his businesses and comply with the emoluments clause of the Constitution). We know he will. Our concern is that Congress will do nothing about it. Certain GOP senators, key   conservative stalwarts and   aspirants have not shown consistency and a willingness to stand up to the  . Some seem to be taking a    approach. (We trust that Sens. Ben Sasse of Nebraska, Jeff Flake of Arizona and Cory Gardner of Colorado  —   and, of course, John McCain of Arizona and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina  —   will continue their independent, intellectually consistent stances.) But to those who need a forceful reminder: Dear Sens. Ted Cruz ( .) Tom Cotton ( . .) Mike Lee ( ) Marco Rubio ( .) and Tim Scott ( . C.):  You gentlemen never tire of telling us that you are principled defenders of the Constitution, opponents of executive imperialism and robust guardians of national security. That requires that you consider yourself no more deferential to a president of your own party than you were to President Obama. You are obligated to inform the   that violations of the emoluments clause will result in a constitutional crisis. No nominee or legislative initiative should proceed unless the president divests himself of all businesses from which he gains income from foreign governments (e. g. hotels in which foreign diplomats book rooms and banquet facilities). If the president continues to defy the plain text of the Constitution, you should urge House colleagues to proceed with passing articles of impeachment and be prepared to vote accordingly in a Senate trial. Surely you would take the same position if Hillary Clinton had won the election. You should not declare yourself supportive of any nominee, especially one who has never held office and whose views are unknown, before a thorough Senate confirmation hearing. As critics of Obama’s foreign policy, you should reject out of hand nominees who do not acknowledge aggressive moves against the United States   do not insist that American values be part and parcel of American foreign policy.  On the economic front, you have all bemoaned the growing U. S. debt and Obama’s failure to address entitlements. You therefore should reject any tax reform plan that is not   under a reasonable dynamic scoring model. If the White House does not, you should present an entitlement reform plan and work for its passage.  To do otherwise would be to cement the image of the Republicans  —   and you specifically  —   as shameless hypocrites and opportunists. As for the Democrats, we have every expectation that     rights senators such as Ben Cardin (Md.) Chuck Schumer (N. Y.) and Robert Menendez (N. J.) will continue to press for sanctions against Iran for   activity and to insist on strict monitoring of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. Cardin and Menendez in particular have to be resolute in calling out Russian human rights abuses. But will others whose rhetoric often departed from their votes do so as well? (Yes, we are looking at you, Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey.) We surely hope such Democrats will resist unqualified, extreme and ethically suspect nominees, but do so selectively so as not to erode the senators’ own credibility. For those   Democrats facing reelection in 2018 (e. g. Sens. Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, Claire McCaskill of Missouri, Joe Manchin of West Virginia, Jon Tester of Montana and Joe Donnelly of Indiana) we urge you to resist the lure of   bullies,         groups, Fox   hosts and others who threaten all manner of retribution unless you fall into line with Trump (who won each of these states). If you do so, you’ll face primary challenges   demoralize Democrats whom you will need to turn out in the general election. You should be among the most strident opponents of tax proposals that favor the very rich, of protectionist measures that imperil your states’ farmers and exporters and of Obamacare “repeal and delay” measures that leave Americans uncertain about the future of their health care. Well, you can see why we worry that Congress will not do its institutional job to act as a check on the president. We are hoping that lawmakers do the right thing, regardless of partisan loyalties. That’s usually a long shot. Nevertheless, if lawmakers wilt in fear of Trump’s wrath, then whatever disasters follow will be their responsibility as much as Trump’s."

"," A   will take effect across much of Syria from midnight Thursday, the Syrian army announced, in a deal that opposition officials hailed as a rare chance to tamp down violence in the country’s bloody war. In a statement posted to the   Syrian Arab News Agency (SANA) the military declared a “comprehensive” cessation of hostilities following “victories and advances” by Syria’s armed forces. But it said the deal excluded “terrorist organizations” including the Islamic State and the country’s   affiliate, now an influential component of what remains of Syria’s armed opposition. The caveat suggested that the fighting could continue in the northwestern province of Idlib, now the rebels’ final bastion. Their most important stronghold, east Aleppo, fell earlier this month to a coalition of forces loyal to Syrian President Bashar  . That victory is likely to be seen as a milestone in Syria’s      war.  Russian President Vladimir Putin, one of Assad’s most important backers, announced earlier Thursday that agreements on a   have been reached with the Syrian government, Iran and Turkey.      (Reuters)    Notably absent from the peace process was the United States.  As President Obama prepares to leave office next month, Washington’s influence in Syria is much diminished. Moscow and Ankara now are taking the lead on initiatives to end a war that has killed almost half a million people, spurred the largest refu gee crisis since World War II and spawned a global terrorist threat in the form of the Islamic State.  Speaking in a televised meeting with his defense and foreign ministers Thursday, Putin said three documents were signed: the   to begin Friday between the Syrian government and certain rebel groups, an agreement on monitoring the   and a statement of readiness to begin peace talks. Turkey and Russia would act as guarantors of the   Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu said. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov did not mention President Obama in his remarks, instead inviting the incoming Trump administration to join the process after the  ’s inauguration. “I would also like to express my hope that when the administration of Donald Trump assumes its responsibilities, they may also join these efforts in order to work toward this goal in a friendly and collective manner,” Lavrov said during the meeting. According to a partial transcript of the meeting, Shoigu also said that Russia was ready to begin drawing down its deployment in Syria. “All conditions have been created for the reduction of the Russian group in Syria,” Shoigu said, without elaborating on how large the force reduction could be or which forces may be withdrawn.   In October last year, the intervention of Russia’s air force turned the war in the government’s favor. Although Moscow later announced a partial withdrawal, its air and ground forces continue to play an important role, even as the influence of Assad’s other main backer, Iran, rises. Shoigu said seven opposition groups with a combined 60, 000 fighters from central and northern Syria have agreed to the  . Those groups were not immediately identified. The    Jabhat Fatah   formerly called Jabhat   fights as part of a broader coalition involving a range of key rebel brigades, and U. S. officials believe it may be difficult to separate the two.  Previous   have been  . A similar deal announced by the United States and Russia in February lasted longer than most  —   but was over by July. Another U. S.  deal in September lasted a week. Putin, in his televised remarks, offered some caveats about the latest agreements, calling them “fragile and requiring special attention. ” The deals marked an ambitious venture by the Russian leader to establish his dominant role as dealmaker in the Syrian conflict and further sideline the United States less than a month before Trump’s inauguration.   Syria’s National Coalition, a leading political opposition group based in Turkey, confirmed its support for the truce. A senior official, Hadi   described it as “a positive achievement” in a message posted to Twitter, saying his group would “make sure that this agreement will be implemented fully. ” But as diplomacy continued, so did the fighting. A Syrian rescue group known as the White Helmets said Thursday that at least 12 people were killed and 27 others injured in airstrikes and artillery shelling on civilian homes in the Damascus suburb of eastern Ghouta.  Footage from the area showed an elderly man being carried to an ambulance, his   scarf streaking the vehicle as his stretcher was placed inside.  The latest   effort still has to survive the many potential pitfalls of a shaky alliance. But if Putin’s gambit to play peacemaker among the bitter regional rivals of the Middle East is successful, it would mark his greatest international achievement to date. To broker a solution to the region’s bloodiest conflict while pointedly excluding the United States would mark an important shift in the international balance of power  —   one that Putin has called for publicly since he took power in 2000.

","     There is an old saying in politics: The most dangerous place in Washington is between Chuck Schumer and a camera. And the famously   incoming Senate minority leader could find himself in front of plenty of cameras in the months ahead  —   but perhaps not always in a way liberals will be terribly fond of. As of next week, Schumer is the de facto leader of the opposition, wielding the best weapon Democrats have to thwart Republican   Donald Trump and the   Congress: The filibuster. But just how much he will use it  —   and how resolutely he’ll stand in Trump’s way  —   remains to be seen. Schumer himself has suggested there’s plenty of room for common ground, while also talking tough about Trump. Adding to that intrigue is Schumer’s outspokenness, which was on full display Wednesday evening. Hours after Secretary of State John F. Kerry delivered a controversial speech critical of Israeli settlements in the West Bank, Schumer issued a statement. It wasn’t surprising that the strongly   Schumer would be at least somewhat critical of Kerry’s speech, but Schumer really didn’t mince words  —   at all. “While he may not have intended it, I fear Secretary Kerry, in his speech and action at the U. N. has emboldened extremists on both sides,” Schumer said, citing Palestinian attacks after Israelis withdrew from settlements in Gaza. So there’s the incoming leader of the Democrats, suggesting a Democratic secretary of state and former fellow Democratic senator has “emboldened extremists. ” That’s very strong language. Again, this is a   issue on which Schumer’s stance is known and hasn’t generally aligned with the Obama administration. But it reinforces what a wild card he could be going forward. Schumer is something of a political contradiction. He’s perhaps best known in Washington for shepherding Democrats to the Senate majority as the head of that effort last decade. And he’s long been seen as the heir to retiring Sen. Harry M. Reid ( .) as Senate Democrats’ leader. To Republicans, he’s another New York City liberal, and the New York Times a year ago labeled him “the chief villain of the GOP. ” But he’s also run afoul of liberals at times. He’s seen as too closely allied with Wall Street, and environmentalists balk at his support for fracking. He’s seen as too hawkish on Iraq and Iran. Some liberal groups urged the party to go a different direction with its next leader. And some of that   has continued in recent weeks. Schumer is an avowed pragmatist, professing a desire to get things done. But for now, that means working with Trump and Republicans  —   at a time when many Democrats would like to take the tack Republicans took with President Obama and basically stand in the president’s way at all turns (turnabout being fair play an all). Schumer’s and Trump’s relationship promises to be a fascinating one. The two   New Yorkers have even been rumored to be friendly, though Schumer downplays the extent of their relationship. Trump has said nice things about Schumer, tweeting his hope for a productive relationship once Schumer was elevated to Democratic leader of the incoming Senate.   I have always had a good relationship with Chuck Schumer. He is far smarter than Harry R and has the ability to get things done. Good news!  —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 20, 2016   In turn, Schumer has highlighted areas in which they can work together, praising Trump’s plans for a big investment in infrastructure and floating trade and the “carried interest” tax loophole as potential areas of bipartisanship. The big question is just how much political leeway Schumer has in terms of working with Trump, if that’s the route he chooses. As a guy who wants to get things done, there is one path. But as a political strategy, Democrats who are assuming Trump will crash and burn as president won’t like the idea of lending support to some of his agenda items and giving Trump political wins. If Schumer does work with Trump successfully, it will mark a striking shift from an era of resolute partisanship, and Trump will surely be given plenty of credit for that. A Schumer aide, Matt House, offered this bit of guidance this week for what lay ahead: “We’re not going to say no to something just because Trump’s name is on it. If people are concerned we’re going to work with Trump, they’re concerned we’re going to work with Trump on things Democrats have been fighting for for a long time. People need to pay attention to the nuances. ” But nuances don’t fare well in the highly partisan environment that is Washington, D. C.    and especially not when it comes to Trump, a man Democrats have decried as a bigot and will want out of office as quickly as possible. Schumer has long proven he’s his own man  —   a thoroughly unique political animal in 21st century American politics. The course he chooses will have big implications for Trump’s presidency, his party and, of course, the country. And it will be fascinating to watch."

","     The truck attack on a Christmas market in Berlin last week may have been cut short when the truck automatically deployed its brakes, the result of European Union regulations that require automatic braking systems on large trucks. The new detail, revealed jointly by Germany’s Süddeutsche Zeitung newspaper and broadcasters NDR and WDR on Tuesday, may explain why the truck came to a stop after a few hundred feet. In the end, twelve people were killed in the attack, but there are indications that the E. U.  advanced emergency braking system may have prevented more deaths. It was previously thought that Lukasz Urban, the Polish truck driver whose vehicle had been hijacked, may have fought with the attacker in the moments before the rampage. Urban had multiple stab wounds and had been shot, and investigators suggested that the truck’s erratic path indicated a struggle in the cabin. In response, a British truck driver launched a crowdfunding campaign to raise money for Urban’s family, gathering more than $210, 000. There were also calls for the Polish driver to receive a Federal Cross of Merit, an honor given out by the German government. But the German newspaper Bild later reported that a forensic examination showed that Urban had in fact been shot in the head between 4:30 and 5:30 p. m. several hours before the attack began. Though Urban may have still been alive as the attack took place, doctors believed it was unlikely he would have been conscious. Instead, the   Scania PRT truck may have driven erratically and ultimately stopped because the brakes were deployed. E. U. regulations adopted in 2012 require that all newly manufactured trucks heavier than 3, 500 kilograms (3. 9 tons) be fitted with an advanced emergency braking system. The systems use radar and cameras to detect obstacles and warn the driver. In the event of a crash, the brakes may stop the vehicle entirely. Although the driver can override the brakes, an inexperienced user may not know how. According to Süddeutsche Zeitung, there was high praise for the regulation in Berlin government circles, who said it had “saved lives” and noted that a similar attack involving an older truck in Nice, France, had killed 86 and injured hundreds.

","     Frigid air will grip an unusually large portion of the Lower 48 states in just over a week’s time. The cold is predicted to consume almost the entire nation, from the Pacific Northwest to the Southeast, sparing only Florida. While some parts of the country are forecast to experience temperatures 30 to 50 degrees colder than normal, the cold snap will be most remarkable for the amount of real estate it is predicted to cover. Brian Brettschneider, a climatologist based in Alaska, noted Wednesday that the National Weather Service’s   to   temperature outlook projected the nation’s largest area with high confidence (90 percent probability) of   temperatures since November 2014.    Forecast temperature difference from normal between Saturday Dec. 31 and Saturday Jan. 7.

Some of the coldest air, relative to average, will focus on the region from the Pacific Northwest to the Northern Plains early to the middle of next week. Cliff Mass, an atmospheric science professor who blogs about Seattle weather, wrote that the cold snap could be “far colder than we have seen in many years. ”    Forecast lows from GFS model next Wednesday morning.  Before the cold air reaches the eastern half of the nation, abnormally warm air (30 to 35 degrees above average) will first surge northward between Monday and Wednesday.

But Ryan Maue, a meteorologist with WeatherBell Analytics, said an elongated jet stream will “allow chunks or blobs” of the frigid air to work their way east. “It’s clear by Day 10 [Jan. 8] that there is a very strong cold signal (10 degrees or colder anomalies across entire U. S. coast to coast) except for South Florida, which has enjoyed record heat during December,” he said. Matt Rogers, a meteorologist with Commodity Weather Group, said it takes a rare jet stream to deliver cold air to both coasts simultaneously. “Typical jet stream wavelengths are too narrow to allow cold outbreaks to reach    nearly simultaneously,” he said. “The width of this upper level trough pattern is impressively large. ”    Jet stream pattern forecast by European model in the middle of next week.

This kind of pattern happens more frequently during La Niña events like we’re seeing now, according to Michael Ventrice, a meteorologist with the Weather Company. But he cautioned that it would not be a “permanent fixture” of the winter.

","     A backlash to globalization appears to be gaining strength around the world. U. S. politicians on both the right and left have called for curbing free trade deals they say benefit foreigners or the global elite.   Donald Trump has championed tariffs on imports and limits on immigration, and suggested withdrawing from international alliances and trade agreements. Meanwhile, populist and nationalist governments have gained ground in Europe and Asia, and voters in Britain have elected to withdraw from the European Union. To some, it looks ominously like another moment in history  —   the period leading up to World War I, which marked the end of a   expansion in global ties that many call the first era of globalization. In a recent report, Josh Feinman, the chief global economist for Deutsche Asset Management, says that the world could see a substantial backsliding to globalization in decades to come. After all, he writes, we have seen it happen before, in the years of chaos and isolationism that encompassed the First and Second World Wars and the Great Depression. “The first great globalization wave, in the   or so before WWI, sparked a populist backlash too, and ultimately came crashing down in the cataclysms of 1914 to 1945,” says Feinman. Other economists have proposed similar theories in the past. Branko Milanovic, Dani Rodrik, Niall Ferguson, Fred Bergsten and others have argued that globalization is a cyclical process, accelerating and retrenching over decades, as global integration naturally gives rise to a backlash. Like Feinman, many see the period leading up to World War I as an illustrative example. From the   century to 1914, advances like steamships, the telegraph, the telephone and the Suez and Panama canals dramatically shrunk distances and increased communication, and the world underwent a period of rapid globalization. Roughly 60 million Europeans left   countries in Europe for   lands in the United States, Canada, Argentina, Australia and elsewhere, Feinman says. Countries also lowered their barriers to imported goods and embraced trade. As this chart from Feinman’s report shows, merchandise exports rose as a share of the economy, evidence of globalization.    Deutsche Asset Management  These changes spread the benefits of the Industrial Revolution around the world, Feinman says. But in some places, particularly wealthier countries, they also worsened inequality. Trade enriched some people but left others behind, triggering unrest and a political backlash. As Feinman writes, countries gradually introduced more trade barriers and restrictions on immigration. With the support of American workers, the United States passed a law in 1921 that imposed strict quotas on immigrants, especially those who were poor or from outside of northern Europe. With the World Wars and the Great Depression, globalization collapsed, and nationalist movements and economic isolationism reigned for decades. In the decades following World War II, the pendulum swung in the other direction. The United States led the world in creating and expanding international organizations like the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the precursor to the World Trade Organization  —   institutions that creators believed might help make another world war impossible. Since then, the world has experienced what many think of as the second great wave of globalization. There are many differences among these eras of globalization and retrenchment, Feinman is careful to say. The World Wars and Great Depression were not just about a rejection of globalization, and that rejection of globalization was as much a result of those events as their cause, he writes. Yet there are some strong parallels, Feinman says. “Modern globalization has been spurred by some of the same forces that powered the   epoch: New technologies, an open,     world economic system underpinned by the leading power of the day, and a period of general peace among major countries. ” Today, the free flow of capital and trade exceeds what it was in the   War I era. And the share of Americans who are   and the share of wealth owned by the richest Americans  —   an indicator of inequality  —   have returned to   War I levels, after dipping during the   as the two graphs below show.    Deutsche Asset Management      As before World War I, the second great wave of globalization led to a surge in immigration and increasing inequality in some countries, which likely helped to trigger the current backlash. Feinman says that globalization is far from solely responsible for the economic malaise that some in the United States and around the world experience. In addition to globalization, technology, social changes and government policies have all been instrumental in determining who benefits and who loses out from global economic integration in past decades. But globalization has also hurt some   workers by exposing them to competition. In addition, globalization may make an easier political scapegoat, says Feinman: It’s easier for politicians to blame foreign countries for their troubles than technology, since technology is often viewed in a positive light. Economically, we are seeing signs that globalization may be shifting into a lower gear. In September, the WTO projected that global trade growth would fall to 1. 7 percent in 2016, the slowest pace since the 2009 financial crisis. The share of America’s population that is   has decelerated. And the world is seeing more trade barriers and a dramatic slowdown in the crafting of new trade pacts. At this point, the threat to globalization is mostly a risk rather than a reality, says Feinman, and “cooler heads may well prevail. ” The global economy is still remarkably integrated, and new technology is tying people around the world more closely than ever before. Yet, as history demonstrates, this process can be reversed.

142546,218054,The Asian American ‘advantage’ that is actually an illusion,Washington Post,Jeff Guo,2016-12-29,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161230000842/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/12/29/the-asian-american-advantage-that-is-actually-an-illusion/
","     For decades, the data on median household incomes have shown the same, persistent racial disparities: Asians beating out whites at the top, while Hispanics and blacks hover near the bottom.     Asian Americans seem to offer proof that minorities can prosper  —   and even leapfrog whites  —   if they work hard and jump through the right hoops. For that reason, Asian Americans have often been invoked as a way to excuse the income gaps between whites and blacks or whites and Hispanics. But why do typical Asian American households outearn typical white households? Like many statistics showing an Asian American advantage, this fact proves illusory upon closer examination. A common explanation is that Asian Americans are better educated. While that’s true, there’s another factor that can completely account for the income gap between Asians and whites. It has to do with where people reside. Prices and rents vary wildly in different parts of the country. The cost of living near Jonesboro, Ark. for instance, is about 18 percent below the national average, while the cost of living near San Francisco is about 21 percent above the national average. White and African Americans are more likely to live in cheaper locales, while Asian and Hispanic Americans are more likely to live in pricier ones. The contrast between whites and Asians is particularly stark. Nearly 1 in 5 white Americans reside in rural counties, where a dollar goes a lot further. But 97 percent of Asian Americans live in or near a major city, where the cost of living is higher.     These histograms provide the full account of how different groups are distributed among the nation’s 381 major metro areas, which contain about 85 percent of Americans overall. From left to right, the bars show the fraction of people who live in   average and   parts of the country. The data on price levels come from the Bureau of Economic Analysis, which calculates local indexes based on surveys of rents and household purchases.     White Americans tend to live near less expensive metro areas, such as St. Louis or Cincinnati  —   both cities where prices are 10 percent below the national average. About   of white Americans live in a metro area with   costs;   live in metro areas with   costs; and the rest live in rural areas, where prices are lower still.  Asian Americans, largely for historical reasons, cluster near expensive coastal cities. More than 25 percent of Asian Americans live in one of the four metro areas with the highest costs of living  —   Honolulu, San Jose, New York and San Francisco. Overall, about 73 percent live in metro areas with   costs, 24 percent live in metro areas with   costs, and 3 percent live in rural areas. When we factor in these geographic patterns, the racial income gaps start to look a little different. This chart shows median household incomes before and after adjusting for local costs of living.     What stands out is that the median Asian American income declines by more than 8 percent. The entire gap between Asian American and white households is erased by the    calculation. So while Asian American households seem richer on paper, many of them don’t really feel richer because they live in places where the rent is high and the groceries are more expensive. Other changes are less dramatic. White incomes rise a little, as do black incomes, but the   income gap doesn’t seem to move much. The median Hispanic household income declines by about 3 percent, but it remains neck and neck with the median black income. There are a couple reasons we don’t often adjust for the cost of living when reporting economic statistics. For one, the process is a bit tricky. You need access to the underlying survey data showing where individuals live. And there’s still a lot of price variation within a single metro area. Living in Flushing in Queens  —   home to many Asian Americans in the New York City area  —   is much cheaper than living in SoHo. But the available data on local prices aren’t that  . So these calculations represent a rough approximation. Furthermore, it’s unclear what the policy recommendations would be. Would it benefit Asian and Hispanic Americans to pack up for   cities? Maybe. But there are reasons that certain groups crowd into certain cities. Places like San Francisco and New York have been sites of Asian immigration going as far back as the 1800s. The ethnic networks that have taken root there make life easier in tangible and intangible ways, helping people find jobs, linking them to social services, and giving them a sense of community. Because of these social networks, many residents of these ethnic enclaves choose to stay despite the rising rents. Even if there isn’t anything we can immediately do about the racial disparities in purchasing power, it’s important to recognize how this complicates the stereotype of Asian American success. There’s a long history of politicians wielding statistics about Asians against other minorities. The fact that Asian Americans outearn white Americans on average has often been used to deny claims that whites enjoy special advantages in America.  But Asian Americans have to work harder just to keep up with whites. If you compare whites and Asian Americans with the same amount of schooling, Asian Americans actually make less money. If Asian Americans seem prosperous  —   and many aren’t, by the way  —   that’s only because a much greater fraction of Asian Americans have advanced degrees. And despite those educational advantages, it’s an open question whether Asian American incomes are higher than white incomes in any meaningful sense. As we’ve seen, a startling number of them live in places where a dollar just doesn’t stretch as far, where it’s costlier just to put a roof over your head. Technical notes: I used data from the Census Bureau’s American Community Survey, which covers more than 3 million Americans living in more than 1 million households. For each of those million households, I adjusted the reported income according to the local cost of living. If the household lived in a metro area, I used the cost of living for that metro area. If the household lived outside of a metro area, I used the cost of living for   regions in that state. Then I recalculated summary statistics using the new adjusted incomes. Household   is assigned according to the   of the household head. White, Asian and black categories are all    .   Following Pew, all incomes are standardized to a household size of three. I used the square root scale, which both Pew and the OECD use to compare incomes across households. If you don’t adjust for household size, the income gap between white and Asian households is even greater because Asian households tend to be larger. Similarly, after adjusting for household size, the gap in median income between Hispanic and African American households more or less disappears because Hispanic households tend to be larger."

Yes, the CIA has an official art collection, although you can’t just drive up to the agency to check it out.  But for as little as the cost of about a week’s worth of coffee, you can adorn your kitchen wall with prints of genuine CIA artwork showing clandestine missions from World War II to Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan.   The calendar’s month of April features “The First Sting,” by Stuart Brown. It depicts a mujahideen fighter firing a Stinger antiaircraft missile at a Soviet gunship in Afghanistan in the 1980s. (Stuart Brown)    The calendars are on sale for $28 at the International Spy Museum and its online gift store; or, for $23. 95 on the website of its producer, Erik Kirzinger, a North Carolina man whose uncle, a CIA contractor, was killed during a 1952 mission in China depicted in one of the calendar paintings, “Ambush in Manchuria. ” But the CIA won’t sell the calendar at its own gift shop. “I bent over backwards to make sure everyone on their end was comfortable,” Kirzinger said, declining to elaborate. “I mean, the CIA gift shop has sold    coffee mugs with the CIA logo on it. Good grief!” Toni Hiley, the longtime CIA museum director, said the gift shop can’t sell the calendar because “it’s not an official work of the U. S. government. ”  For the folks who run the International Spy Museum in downtown Washington, the CIA’s loss is their gain. The shop bought 25 copies of the calendar and quickly sold out. Then the museum store purchased another 300. “When we tell visitors that it’s the first time you can have prints of these paintings all together, they’re surprised and they get really excited, and they also get excited that the CIA logo itself is on it,” said Allison Bishop, a book buyer for the spy museum and retail store. “So few products have the CIA logo allowed to be on the product. ” (In true, cryptic CIA fashion, Kirzinger’s calendar cover does carry the agency’s blue seal with an eagle, but he said the agency also required him to print a disclaimer next to the seal that says the CIA “does not approve, endorse or authorize use of its name, initials, or Seal. ”) It was Kirzinger, 65, who began commissioning large    paintings for the CIA. And it was Kirzinger who designed and published the calendar with his own money, along with significant contributions from a retired case officer in California and the chief executive of a technology company whose father was a CIA contract pilot. “I am unaware of any other CIA calendar like this,” Kirzinger said. “If the    scenes depicted in the CIA artwork involved the service branches, there certainly would be large medal presentation ceremonies with marching bands and   public acclaim. But for the men and women in the ‘silent service,’ everything is on a    basis, including whether or not medals and citations were presented. ” The backs of each page contain several paragraphs of Kirzinger’s research, archival photos of agency personnel, and other documents. In advance of its release last month, he submitted the calendar to the agency’s museum and staff historians to verify its accuracy. Though Kirzinger has never worked in the spy business himself, he led a peripatetic life, working as a logger, a fly fishing guide, a cowboy on a   cattle ranch in Montana, and the regional director of a   Chinese restaurant franchise. He first made contact with the CIA nearly two decades ago, thanks to his dogged attempt to find the remains of his uncle, Norman A. Schwartz, a pilot killed on a secret mission into Communist China in 1952. In the spring of 1998, Kirzinger’s aging mother pushed him to have Schwartz’s remains repatriated from China, where his plane crashed, so he could be buried next to their parents in Louisville.  After getting nowhere, Kirzinger wrote   Director George J. Tenet. A few weeks later, his office called back, disclosing that the agency would chisel a star onto its marble Memorial Wall in his honor. Though Schwartz’s remains were never found, he was posthumously awarded the Distinguished Intelligence Cross, the CIA’s highest honor of valor. At the CIA’s annual Memorial Wall ceremony in 2000, Kirzinger said Tenet’s vivid remarks about the slain operatives inspired his project. “I just had these visions of art work, from the OSS through the contemporary war on global terrorism, and if you lined up all these paintings, you’d see the visual history of the CIA, one painting at a time,” he said. “I knew the only artwork at the headquarters was some   ‘modern art’ . . . and tacky Americana prints. ” Eventually, Kirzinger pitched himself to the CIA as a volunteer who could find the artists, pool private donations to pay them, and research the missions’ scenes to ensure the paintings’ accuracy. The first painting, “Earthquake’s Final Flight,” which depicts a CIA plane in May 1954 under fire over North Vietnam, was installed at the agency in 2005. “Erik’s vision for the collection ran parallel to our own desire to create a   art collection,” said Hiley, the agency’s longtime museum director. She added that the CIA wanted to amass a collection on par with the combat paintings owned by other military branches. In June 2010, after multiple pieces had been unveiled at the agency, Kirzinger was presented with the CIA’s highest civilian honor, the Agency Seal Medal. After that, Kirzinger bowed out of his role as the agency’s unofficial arts commissioner. But last year, he decided to incorporate those paintings into the inaugural Secret Ops of the CIA calendar, at the insistence of one of the artworks’ donors, Bruce Walker, a retired CIA case officer in San Francisco. “Erik’s very patriotic to begin with, but he’s very skilled with understanding what the agency needed to pull this off,” said Walker, 84. “To achieve this product requires a lot of finesse and diplomacy. ” Where does Kirzinger hang his Secret Ops of the CIA calendar? “Um, I don’t have one,” he said. “As soon as I get ’em, I give ’em away. I have to send a batch to the CIA director and another batch to the Directorate of Operations. ” "

","     Somewhere between Texas and Alabama, something went very, very wrong for eight captive songbirds. A salon owner in the tiny town of Grant, Ala. ordered the canaries from Texas, she told AL. com  —   a birthday present to herself. Rhonda King paid an extra $100 to ship them overnight. But her 60th birthday came and went Dec. 5. No birds, and none the next day. Three days late, the letter carrier finally walked into her salon, she told AL. com. “Your birds arrived,” she remembered him saying. “They’re not alive. ”  This was evident from the state of the package, King told the reporter: “I was handed this box with tire tracks on it and bird carnage hanging out. ” Before meeting disaster on the road, King said, the birds had been packaged with air holes in a federally compliant box. In fact, the U. S. Postal Service has strict guidelines on   animals  —   from songbirds to snakes. Kittens, for example, are “not mailable” under USPS Publication 52, Section 525. Neither are “poisonous insects and all spiders, except scorpions under limited circumstances. ”   chickens, on the other hand, can be mailed. If everything goes right, anyway.  It didn’t for a farmer in Mercer, Maine, who told the Morning Sentinel in 2014 that his order of 25 baby chicks arrived late and as dead as King’s canaries. The owner of the hatchery that mailed the chicks told the outlet that 1 or 2 percent of its shipments die in transit  —   up to 26, 000 dead chickens a year. And a PETA case worker told the outlet that the group received thousands of reports of dead or suffering animals in transit. King’s mess of songbirds seems to be a rare case, though. And the USPS tried to make amends. The Postal Service followed up with a belated apology, per the Associated Press, and offered to reimburse the stylist. The government couldn’t bring back her birds. Still, a faint hope remained. King had ordered eight live canaries and received just six dead ones. The Postal Service didn’t return a call from The Washington Post about what exactly befell the shipment  —   leaving open the possibility that two missing birds are brightening the skies over Alabama."
142549,218062,Putin says he won’t deport U.S. diplomats as he looks to cultivate relations with Trump,Washington Post,Andrew Roth,2016-12-30,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161231004909/https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/russia-plans-retaliation-and-serious-discomfortoverus-hacking-sanctions/2016/12/30/4efd3650-ce12-11e6-85cd-e66532e35a44_story.html
","  MOSCOW  —   On a day when everyone expected him to go low, Russian President Vladimir Putin took the high road, bowing out of a growing diplomatic showdown with the administration of President Obama in a gambit to woo his successor, Donald Trump. In a rare, and calculated, break from the diplomatic tradition of reciprocal punishment, Putin opted to do nothing after the United States said it would expel 35 Russian diplomats and close a pair of   properties in retaliation for Moscow’s meddling in the 2016 presidential election. Putin said he would wait to see how U. S.  relations develop under the new Trump administration before planning “any further steps” on the issue.   Until Putin’s surprise decision Friday, all signs pointed toward the familiar,   Kremlin response of years past. In 2012, when Russia was slapped with U. S. sanctions over the death of lawyer Sergei Magnitsky, Putin shot back by signing a ban on all foreign adoptions of Russian children, just days after Christmas, sparking outrage. But this time, with the Kremlin bidding farewell to Obama and betting that a friendly Trump administration will bring fresh opportunities to escape sanctions and make a grab for greater power status, Putin waxed magnanimous.       (The Washington Post)   “We will not create any problems for U. S. diplomats,” Putin said in a statement late Friday afternoon. “We will not expel anyone. We will not prevent their families and children from using their traditional leisure sites during the New Year’s holidays. ” Instead of sending the U. S. diplomats home, Putin invited their kids over for “the New Year and Christmas children’s parties in the Kremlin. ” Then he wished the Obamas a happy new year and bid season’s greetings to “Donald Trump and the American people. ” One person in particular appreciated that approach.  “Great move on delay (by V. Putin)  —   I always knew he was very smart!” Trump wrote in a tweet Friday afternoon, his latest public expression of admiration for the Russian leader. Russia has denied and ridiculed accusations by Obama and the U. S. intelligence community that it sponsored hackers to steal and then leak sensitive information about Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton to sway the election in favor of Trump. Putin on Friday accused the United States of engaging in “irresponsible ‘kitchen’ diplomacy” and said Russia would retain its “right to retaliate. ” Trump’s unorthodox views on Putin have sent shock waves through his own party, and the sanctions against Russia imposed by Obama on Thursday will present him with a new challenge. Should the Republican choose to remove some or all of the sanctions after his inauguration next month, he would be acting in opposition to public statements made by congressional GOP leaders  —   and forcing them to decide whether to accept or resist his efforts to remake U. S.  relations.   Russian President Vladimir Putin in St. Petersburg. (Dmitri  )  Still, Putin’s decision not to escalate the situation may make it easier, if just marginally, for him to do that. Putin’s theatrical turnabout came just hours before Russians set off for their snowbound dachas for a week of holiday festivities. The Russian Foreign Ministry pledged to send a plane to collect the departing Russian diplomats and complained that Washington had been inconsiderate by deporting embassy employees just before the winter break. In declining a “symmetrical response,” Putin disregarded a public proposal from his foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, who suggested the expulsion of 35 U. S. diplomats and the closure of two U. S.  properties in Moscow  —   a warehouse and a dacha used for receptions. That retreat was far humbler than the compound lost to the Russians, a luxurious   estate at Pioneer Point in Maryland, a site purchased by the Soviet government in 1972 that features tennis courts and bungalows and, during the Soviet period, played host to dinner parties of vodka and caviar. “Putin’s asymmetric response to Obama’s new sanctions is an investment in the incoming Trump presidency,” Dmitri Trenin, the head of the Moscow Carnegie Center, wrote online shortly after Putin’s announcement.  Putin’s decision followed a drumbeat of threats from Russian officials about coming countersanctions that focused their ire on the outgoing Obama administration. Until the last moment, it seemed likely that Moscow would follow Friday with its own mass expulsion of U. S. diplomats, similar to when Russia and the United States deported more than 100 diplomats combined in a 2001 spat sparked by the spying case of former FBI agent Robert Hanssen.  Earlier Friday, Putin’s spokesman had said that the Russian countersanctions would bring “serious discomfort” for an American diplomatic corps that has already complained about harassment, including slashed tires and aggressive surveillance. A Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman called the Obama administration a “group of    losers, embittered and shortsighted. ” And Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev was openly eulogizing the Obama administration on Twitter. “It is regrettable that the Obama administration, which started out by restoring our ties, is ending its term in an   agony. RIP,” he tweeted in English. The Kremlin will be looking to negotiate with the Trump White House over the role of NATO; the status of Crimea and the conflict in Ukraine; the war in Syria; and a host of other thorny issues that have led U. S.  relations to their lowest ebb since the end of the Cold War. Perhaps most of all, Putin wants Russia to be treated as a great power that will have a seat at the table when major world decisions are being hammered out.  Seeing those opportunities, some Russian politicians called for a measured response to the U. S. sanctions before Putin’s announcement Friday, arguing that an aggressive move could force a response from Trump and set the relationship off on the wrong foot. “Countermeasures, which are typically mandatory, should be weighted in this case, considering the known circumstances of the transitional period and the possible response of the U. S. ” said Konstantin Kosachyov, chairman of the   committee in Russia’s upper house of parliament.  Russian officials are largely positive about the incoming administration, but there are concerns among some policymakers about the new U. S. leader’s unpredictable nature and lack of experience in politics. Kosachyov had previously said that a Trump presidency could open the door to a significant improvement in relations  —   or a severe decline. The nomination of Rex Tillerson, the chief executive of ExxonMobil, was seen as confirmation here that Trump will move forward with his stated plans to revitalize the U. S.  relationship. But his nomination hearings will probably serve as a stage to bring Russia to the fore of the national debate, with Senate Democrats likely to pepper him with questions about his time working closely with Putin and use that as a pivot to focus on Trump’s relationship with the Russian leader as well.  Robert Costa in Washington contributed to this report.       "

","       Donald Trump on Friday expressed his appreciation to Vladimir Putin over the Russian president’s announcement that he would not expel American diplomats in response to new U.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 30, 2016   The tweet is Trump’s latest nod to Putin, whom he has praised as a strong leader  —   inspiring considerable backlash from American politicians from both parties who call the Russian president an authoritarian leader who poses a danger to U. S. interests. The Obama administration on Thursday announced it will expel 35 Russian “intelligence operatives” and shutter facilities in Maryland and New York believed to be used for the Kremlin’s   purposes, as a way to punish Moscow. U. S. intelligence agencies have alleged that Russian   hackers leaked information about former presidential candidate Hillary Clinton to sway the election in Trump’s favor. Russia denies the charge. Putin’s decision not to reciprocate is a sharp departure from the    policies Moscow pursued against the United States in response to   sanctions in 2014.  Putin announced Friday he “won’t create problems for American diplomats” in retaliation while he waits for the new administration to take office, adding he would “plan further steps for restoring the   relationship based in the policies enacted by the administration of President Donald Trump. ” Trump remained relatively quiet about the substance of the sanctions announced Thursday, even as Republican lawmakers greeted them as a necessary, overdue action that should be expanded in the future. The   said only that it was “time for our country to move on to bigger and better things” and promised he would meet with intelligence leaders next week to get more details."

","     With just one day to go before he leaves office, North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory (R) threw a legal Hail Mary to the U. S. Supreme Court in another apparent effort to undermine his Democratic successor’s ability to govern. McCrory filed an emergency request to the Supreme Court, asking the justices to pause   special elections for more than two dozen state legislative districts in 2017  —   special elections in which Democrats could have an opportunity to pick up seats in North Carolina’s   legislature. A federal court found in the summer that 28 state House and Senate districts were racially gerrymandered, but the   panel made the unusual decision to let the election go forward in those districts because it decided it was too late to redraw the maps. After the election, the court ordered the legislature to redraw the lines by March and hold special elections later in 2017.  Now, McCrory appears to be making one more,   attempt to stop all that from going forward. ”On Election Day, millions of North Carolina voters went to the polls and selected the state legislators who would represent them in the general assembly for   terms in accordance with the North Carolina Constitution. Or so they thought,” reads the petition, which was sent to Chief Justice John Roberts, who handles emergency appeals for the 4th Circuit but would likely refer it to the entire   court. Even though they lost the governor’s mansion, Republicans will start 2017 with a   supermajority in both North Carolina chambers. Democrats, who seized the governor’s mansion this fall, were excited at the prospect of having a rare second chance to pick up state House and Senate seats in 2017. If the Supreme Court grants McCrory’s request for a stay, though, Democrats could have to wait until the 2018 midterm elections to try to win more seats under a new electoral map. That would mean Gov.  Roy Cooper (D) would spend two years  —   instead of potentially far less time  —   working with a   legislature that’s already proved to be combative. After Cooper unseated McCrory this fall, Republicans convened a special session and passed legislation that would limit his power to appoint Cabinet positions and state and local elections boards. McCrory signed the legislation even though he described parts of it ”wrong and  .” McCrory’s government was already appealing the court’s decision to require lawmakers to redraw the map, but the incoming Democratic governor could simply drop the appeal. The timing suggests McCrory’s request for a stay is more about politics than anything else, says UNC Law professor Michael Gerhardt. ”I think Governor McCrory is determined to end his governorship as a   partisan,” he said.  McCrory’s request comes a day before he leaves office; Cooper will be sworn in shortly after the clock strikes midnight and Saturday turns to Sunday.  It’s not clear what chance McCrory’s request to put a hold on the   and special elections will have in the Supreme Court. Also on Friday, McCrory appointed several of his top aides to key positions on state boards.      North Carolina’s Democratic   Roy Cooper says Republican lawmakers are trying to hinder his work by moving to strip powers from his office. (Reuters)   On Friday, Cooper filed his own lawsuit against Republicans: To stop the recently passed law taking away his power to appoint people to the state elections board. On Friday evening, a county judge agreed to put a temporary hold on the law from going into effect on Jan. 1 until the lawsuit could go forward. Cooper’s legal team said in court more challenges would be filed in the weeks to come, which means North Carolina will likely be awash in lawsuits in the new year."

"," Indiana lawmakers originally promoted the state’s school voucher program as a way to make good on America’s promise of equal opportunity, offering children from poor and    families an escape from public schools that failed to meet their needs. But five years after the program was established, more than half of the state’s voucher recipients have never attended Indiana public schools, meaning that taxpayers are now covering private and religious school tuition for children whose parents had previously footed that bill. Many vouchers also are going to wealthier families, those earning up to $90, 000 for a household of four. The voucher program, one of the nation’s largest and   serves more than 32, 000 children and provides an early glimpse of what education policy could look like in Donald Trump’s presidency.       Trump has signaled that he intends to pour billions of federal dollars into efforts to expand vouchers and charter schools nationwide. Betsy DeVos, his nominee for education secretary, played an important role in lobbying for the establishment of Indiana’s voucher program in 2011. And Vice   Mike Pence led the charge as the state’s governor to loosen eligibility requirements and greatly expand the program’s reach. The idea of sending taxpayer funds to private and parochial schools is one of the most polarizing propositions in education. To proponents, the rapid expansion of Indiana’s program is a model for giving more families better educational options. But Indiana’s voucher program is seen by many public school advocates as a cautionary tale. Most recipients are not leaving the state’s worst schools: Just 3 percent of new recipients of vouchers in 2015 qualified for them because they lived in the boundaries of   public schools. And while overall private school enrollment grew by 12, 000 students over the past five years, the number of voucher recipients grew by 29, 000, according to state data, meaning that taxpayer money is potentially helping thousands of families pay for a choice they were already making. Most recipients qualify for free or   lunches, according to state data, but a growing proportion  —   now 31 percent  —   do not.            students listen to their teacher, Loretta Montgomery, during their math and science class at Horizon Christian Academy in Fort Wayne. (Joshua   The Washington Post)     “The political strategy that voucher supporters have used is to start off small and targeted  —     families and   students  —   then gradually expand it to more groups,” said Douglas Harris, a Tulane University professor of economics who favors choice but has been critical of DeVos’s   approach. “That’s also something the   team will likely try. The term ‘Trojan horse’ comes to mind. ” Indiana’s program offers vouchers to   families, giving them an amount equal to 90 percent of the state funds that otherwise would have gone to their assigned public schools to educate their children. That figure ranges from $4, 700 to $6, 500 per child, depending on the school district. Children from   families get half that amount in vouchers. Indiana’s program has succeeded in reaching children who otherwise would not have the chance to attend private schools. Stephanie Schaefer of Newburgh, Ind. is a    mother of six children, four of whom have used vouchers. For her    daughter, Eliana, the opportunity to attend a private school was transformative: After struggling with learning disabilities and falling behind at her highly regarded public school, Eliana was able to catch up, thanks to   attention at Evansville Christian School. Her progress was a relief for her and her parents. Schaefer said she and her husband, an engineer, own their home and consider themselves  . “We have a comfortable living, but we struggle when it comes to extra,” she said, and they never could have afforded private school without help from the voucher program. “I don’t think public education works for every kid,” Schaefer said. “Parents should have the right to be able to find out where their child can fit, where their child can get the best education. ”    Pence’s support Indiana’s legislature first approved a limited voucher program in 2011, capping it at 7, 500 students in the first year and restricting it to children who had attended public schools for at least a year. “Public schools will get first shot at every child,”  . Mitch Daniels (R) said at the time. “If the public school delivers and succeeds, no one will seek to exercise this choice. ” DeVos, who had lobbied for the program as chairwoman of the American Federation for Children, hailed its passage and proposed that other states follow Indiana’s lead. Two years later, Pence entered the governor’s office with a pledge to extend vouchers to more children. “There’s nothing that ails our schools that can’t be fixed by giving parents more choices and teachers more freedom to teach,” Pence said during his inaugural address in 2013.  Within months, Indiana lawmakers eliminated the requirement that children attend public school before receiving vouchers and lifted the cap on the number of recipients. The income cutoff was raised, and more   families became eligible. When those changes took effect, an estimated 60 percent of all Indiana children were eligible for vouchers, and the number of recipients jumped from 9, 000 to more than 19, 000 in one year. The proportion of children who had never previously attended Indiana public schools also rose quickly: By 2016, more than half of voucher recipients  —   52 percent  —   had never been in the state’s public school system. “Governor Pence supports the rights of parents to exercise choice and select the best school for their children,” Kara Brooks, Pence’s press secretary, said in a statement to The Washington Post. The state Education Department says taxpayers are taking on $53 million in tuition costs that they were not bearing before, although it is unclear how many of those students would otherwise attend public schools  —   with state funding  —   if there were no vouchers. Voucher proponents dismiss the estimate as inflated by a Democratic state education chief. Mychal Thom, head of Concordia Lutheran High School in Fort Wayne, estimated that at least half of his school’s 366 voucher recipients last year would have enrolled at Concordia even if the voucher program did not exist. “It’s just reduced some of the financial burden on families to attend,” he said. Janelle Ruba, principal of Adventist Christian Elementary in Bloomington, said the same of her small school: “Most of the students were already in our school, so the vouchers have just helped with their payment. ” According to state data, more than 300 Indiana private schools accepted vouchers last year. Voucher recipients composed more than 75 percent of students at 44 of those schools, most of which identify themselves as Catholic, Lutheran or Christian.     Students pass “The Road to Success” sign displayed in the hallway at Horizon Christian Academy in Fort Wayne, Ind. (Joshua   The Washington Post)  Opponents skeptical Opponents argue that vouchers are not reaching the children most in need of better schools. They also assert that voucher programs violate the constitutional separation of church and state by funneling public dollars into religious schools, including those that teach creationism instead of the theory of evolution. Indiana’s program survived a legal challenge in 2013, when a judge ruled that the primary beneficiaries of the vouchers were families, not religious institutions. Indiana has no financial reporting requirements for private schools that receive public funds, leaving taxpayers with less oversight and accountability than with the state’s public schools. And although the state’s voucher program has more stringent academic expectations than many others  —   private schools must give the same state tests as public schools, are graded on the same    scale and can be prohibited from accepting new voucher students if they perform poorly  —   there are loopholes. Small schools do not get letter grades, for example, and thus are immune to the consequences for poor performance, according to state education officials. Even schools deemed failing sometimes continue receiving voucher money, according to state records.  Horizon Christian Academy, for example, had three campuses at which 85 percent of students received vouchers in   bringing in a total of $2. 8 million in state funds. Horizon has not fared well on the state’s grading system, and one of its campuses received two F’s in a row, a performance so poor that the school should have faced consequences this year, according to state law. Horizon consolidated its three schools into one, which was then allowed to continue accepting new voucher students this fall  —   though Tammy Henline, a Horizon   and its superintendent, said the consolidation had nothing to do with avoiding accountability: “Having everyone in the same building makes things a little simpler. ” Robert Enlow, president and chief executive of EdChoice, an   organization that advocates for vouchers nationwide, said he wondered why voucher opponents are not as skeptical of persistently terrible public schools as they are of private schools. “We have schools that have been dropout factories in this state forever,” he said. Effect on public schools Even as vouchers have shored up many parochial schools, public schools have been squeezed: State education spending has not kept up with inflation, and still is not as high, in real dollars, as it was in 2011, according to Lawrence DeBoer, an economist at Purdue University. But it is not clear how the vouchers have affected public school finances. Indiana state tax money follows children to whatever schools they attend, so public schools that lose students also lose revenue. But spending on vouchers has not affected the rate of growth in overall state aid to local districts, DeBoer said, noting that the $132 million price tag for vouchers in 2016 was a tiny fraction of the $6. 9 billion that local districts received from the state. It is also not clear that vouchers are an effective way to boost student achievement. Some research has found that after using vouchers to transfer from public to private schools, Indianapolis students experienced no change in language arts performance and saw a decline in their math performance. Studies of other statewide voucher programs have made similar findings. Glenda Ritz, the state’s superintendent of public instruction, said Indiana has spent nearly $375 million to date on a voucher program that has yet to be evaluated. “Before replicating this program on a national level, Hoosier taxpayers deserve a full accounting of the impact this program is having on student academic achievement and diversity as well as the fiscal impact on public school funding,” she said. Other studies have found that voucher programs boost college enrollment and completion rates, especially among minority and   students. To some Hoosiers, worries about school funding and student achievement are secondary to questions about the effect that vouchers might have on public education’s role as a civic institution. Private schools set their own admissions standards and can reject students for any reason, leading to concerns about segregation not just by race and class, but also by faith, ability and disability. “If we’re going to expand vouchers further, folks have to grapple with: Are we going to distribute public funds to private entities that can practice discriminatory or exclusionary practices?” said David B. Smith, superintendent of public schools in Evansville, Ind.  This article was produced in partnership with the Investigative Reporting Workshop at American University, where McLaren is a student. "

Then she entrusted her career to USA Swimming,Washington Post,Will Hobson,2016-12-30,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161231004909/https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/olympics/she-was-on-course-for-stardom-then-she-entrusted-her-career-to-usa-swimming/2016/12/30/170ffc8c-c796-11e6-85b5-76616a33048d_story.html
","       PHOENIX, Ariz.  —   This was supposed to be the year Dagny Knutson became a household name by thrashing the competition in the pool in Rio de Janeiro.  In 2010, Knutson was widely considered the next breakout American swimming star. At the urging of USA Swimming officials, she said, Knutson turned down a college scholarship and entrusted her career to the Olympic national governing body for the sport.  And then it all went awry.  In six years, Knutson has gone from   Olympic star to cautionary tale through a series of twists and turns including a fired coach, an eating disorder and an unresolved fraud lawsuit against an Olympic sports insider who Knutson claims betrayed her to maintain friendships with USA Swimming officials.  Knutson’s story, according to her and her lawyers, evinces the massive power imbalance in Olympic sports, where management enjoys monopoly control and athletes have little leverage. “As athletes, we have to trust USA Swimming has our best interests at heart. And when they take advantage of that, we can’t do anything about it . . . Because they have all the power,” Knutson said. “I can’t think of any other explanation for why they did what they did, other than they don’t care. ”  USA Swimming declined to comment for this story. In a deposition, USA Swimming Executive Director Chuck Wielgus blamed Knutson’s situation on a former coach who made promises he wasn’t authorized to make.  “USA Swimming likes to do the right thing. We hang our hat on that,” Wielgus said.  Today, Knutson is a    counselor for college students in Phoenix, living in a   apartment with no trace of her former life as a   swimmer. The medals and Team USA garb are packed in boxes in her mother’s North Dakota home. “She was just a thoroughbred that they wanted to put out to pasture, or get rid of,” said her mother, Ronda Knutson. “I’m just sickened by it. ”    Knutson turned down college scholarship offers to turn professional and train with USA Swimming. (Caitlin O’  The Washington Post)  Not ‘the typical path’ Born in 1992, Knutson grew up in Minot, N. D. a town of about 35, 000 people where neighbors leave garage doors open and front doors unlocked. Inspired by watching the 2000 Sydney Olympics with her father, Knutson started swimming competitively at age 9.  When she was 12, Knutson set four state records, earning a mention in Sports Illustrated. When she was 16, Knutson broke the American record in the   individual medley and won six gold medals at a junior international swimming event, posting times that would have made her competitive at the Beijing Olympics the year before. Her performances brought visits from USA Swimming officials to northern North Dakota, a region not known for producing elite swimmers. The only   pool in the area was outdoors and lacked lights. Jim Knutson, an Army veteran and nurse, struck a deal for Dagny to swim there at night in the summers. Jim provided the lights by parking his Jeep near the pool. “It’s just so different than the typical path,” Mark Schubert, the venerated, longtime Olympic swimming coach, told The Washington Post in 2009 about Knutson. “It kind of gives everybody hope. ”  In early 2010, Schubert flew to Minot with a proposition for Knutson and her parents. Knutson had accepted a full athletic scholarship from Auburn University, but had just learned the coach who recruited her was leaving. Dozens of other colleges were interested in her, but Schubert recommended another option, according to Knutson: She could turn professional and train at one of USA Swimming’s “Centers of Excellence,” training facilities Schubert developed.  Knutson would get more individualized attention, Schubert told her, and USA Swimming would offer the equivalent of a full scholarship, covering her tuition, room and living costs through the 2016 Olympics. Her parents had doubts, but after Dagny visited the Center for Excellence in Fullerton, Calif. she was convinced. She moved there in the summer of 2010 and enrolled in community college. The Knutsons never asked Schubert to put the offer in writing, a decision they would later regret.  “I don’t know if you want to call us naive or what, but we just had no reason to believe they wouldn’t do this,” Ronda Knutson said.     Knutson, Katie Hoff, Allison Schmitt and MIssy Franklin show their gold medals for the s 4x200m relay at 2011 world championships. (Michael  )  A deal gone bad In November 2010, USA Swimming abruptly fired Schubert. No reason was given publicly, but Schubert and Wielgus’s relationship reportedly had soured.  With Schubert gone, Knutson reached out to USA Swimming officials about her rent and tuition. It quickly became apparent they had no idea what Schubert had promised her. Headquartered in Colorado Springs, Colo. USA Swimming oversees nearly every level of the sport domestically and manages Team USA at the Olympics and other international events. In 2010, USA Swimming reported $26. 4 million in revenue and paid Wielgus $781, 000 and Schubert $368, 000.  Team USA swimmers, though, made stipends of $1, 750 per month. Almost immediately, court records show, Wielgus expressed concern about the cost of the deal Knutson said she’d been promised. On Nov. 11, 2010, Wielgus emailed several other USA Swimming officials. “Mark apparently made promises . . . to Dagny that: (a) he did not make me or others aware of; and (b) he did not have the authority to make,” he wrote. Schubert denied guaranteeing Knutson tuition support after the 2012 Olympics, but both Knutson’s parents and two other witnesses to the meeting supported Dagny’s claims. Knutson’s agent connected her with Richard Foster, a lawyer   in Olympic circles. Foster has never won a medal or made an Olympic team, but he’s one of many members of the “Olympic movement” who has parlayed his relationships into income over the years. A collegiate water polo player, Foster has served in various capacities for USA Water Polo, the United States Olympic Committee, and FINA, the global organization that oversees international swimming. He wrote a book for Olympic legend Mark Spitz, secured a consulting position with a pool manufacturer and gained clients including several Olympic swimmers and Schubert, the famed coach. From the beginning of his negotiations on Knutson’s behalf, records show, Foster made clear to USA Swimming officials they did not need to worry about a lawsuit from Knutson.  “Chuck: As you know, I represent a lot of athletes, including a fairly large group of swimmers,” Foster wrote Wielgus on Nov. 16, 2010. “If an issue comes up, I will discuss it with you in hopes of resolving the issue. I won’t however get involved with litigation against USA Swimming. I have too many friends in the organization, including you. ”   The next day, Foster emailed Wielgus to let him know an Associated Press reporter had contacted him. Word of Knutson’s situation had started to circulate. “I told the reporter I couldn’t comment,” Foster wrote.  After months of negotiations, Foster emailed Knutson what he termed the “final offer”: USA Swimming would cover Knutson’s college costs through 2016, but only if she maintained a spot in either the top 25 of the world or top three in the U. S. in one Olympic event. Before signing, Knutson balked at the performance requirement. She didn’t like the idea that if she had a bad year, or got hurt, she’d lose her college money. As her lawyer, Foster replied, “A performance marker is not unreasonable. ” A few days later, he sent over the contract. “Dagny: We wanted to get a little more up front, but this is a good deal,” he wrote. She signed it. At first, things went well. Knutson moved to Gainesville, Fla. attended community college and trained under University of Florida Coach Gregg Troy. In 2011, she won a gold medal at the FINA World Championships as part of the   freestyle relay team that included Missy Franklin.  In 2012, a private struggle Knutson had been dealing with burst into public view. She had an eating disorder  —   bulimia  —   marked by periods of binging followed by purging, or making herself throw up. Studies have shown eating disorder rates are higher among athletes, particularly women, than the general population.  While Franklin won four gold medals at the London Olympics, Knutson cycled through inpatient and outpatient therapy. By the fall of 2012, her condition stabilized, Knutson asked USA Swimming to start her tuition assistance at a college in North Dakota, closer to home.  Lindsay Mintenko, USA Swimming’s national team director, told Knutson her tuition support was over, because she’d fallen from the world rankings while in treatment.  Without financial assistance, Knutson’s parents struggled to pay tuition and her travel and training costs as she tried to regain a national team spot . Knutson petitioned the NCAA to restore her amateur status, so she could get another scholarship, but her appeal was denied. She eventually retired from competitive swimming.  In 2014, a friend connected Knutson with Bob Allard, a San Jose attorney   in Olympic circles for his outspoken criticism of USA Swimming for how it’s handled   prevention.  Allard felt that Knutson had viable fraud lawsuits against USA Swimming and Schubert, but as part of the deal Foster negotiated, Knutson had agreed not to sue either.  There was one person she could still sue, though: Foster.  “Until I hired Bob, I knew I had gotten screwed over, but I didn’t know how,” Knutson said. “I thought it was all my fault. ”    Knutson had been reluctant to add performance benchmarks to her agreement with USA Swimming. (Caitlin O’  The Washington Post)  ‘A dangerous outcome’ Last June, as Knutson’s former teammates and other Olympic hopefuls prepared for U. S. trials  Knutson sat in a California courtroom, looking on as Allard made his opening argument. “This is a case about a   lawyer in the aquatics industry who takes on, as a client, a young and vulnerable potential Olympic champion, but places her interests well behind those of his friends, his political allies and his business associates,” Allard told the jury. “That’s what this case is all about: a lawyer selling out his client. ” Foster pointed out the deal he got Knutson was the most lucrative USA Swimming had ever given a swimmer. When asked about his email assuring Wielgus he would never sue, Foster said his friendships help him and his clients.  “I can achieve good results negotiating with USA Swimming or any sport because of my involvement in the Olympic movement . . . They will take my calls,” Foster testified. “My personal relationship with them allows me access and to negotiate those deals. So if I file a lawsuit against them, I think that access is going to be gone. ” When asked why he didn’t comment to the AP reporter or ask the Knutsons if they wanted to take their story public, Foster explained that “throwing Mr. Wielgus under the bus with the press . . . could have resulted in a very dangerous outcome for Dagny. ”  Allard hired a malpractice law expert, Alison Buchanan, who concluded Foster violated ethical guidelines by not listing to Knutson all his conflicts of interest in writing. Foster also violated his duty to be a “zealous advocate” for Knutson, Buchanan testified. “He wasn’t really working within her best interest,” Buchanan said. “I didn’t see any communications between Mr. Foster and USA Swimming where he took a hard stance or threatened litigation. Instead he said, ‘I would never sue you’ . . . That, to me, is the opposite of zealous advocacy. ”  The jurors found Foster committed a breach of fiduciary duty and fraud, and they awarded Knutson $617, 800. In October, however, the judge threw out the verdict and ordered a new trial. The judge ruled that Knutson failed to prove a different lawyer could have gotten her a better deal. Allard is appealing.  In a recent phone interview, Foster said Knutson’s anger at him is misguided.  “I worked for her, for free, out of the goodness of my heart,” Foster said. “She’d been treated badly by USA Swimming. And I got her a good deal. ” In Olympic sports, Foster pointed out, national governing bodies rarely pay athletes much, and   contracts are almost nonexistent.  “USA Swimming would not back down. They said, ‘We’re putting up a lot of money for an athlete that hasn’t even medaled yet,’ ” Foster said. “Those performance markers for her were not unreasonable . . . She was one of the best swimmers in the world. ”    Knutson no longer swims competitively: ‘It feels like another human swam.’ (Caitlin O’  The Washington Post)  A new life In April, Knutson graduated from Grand Canyon University in Phoenix, with a degree in sports management. She works at the school as a counselor, helping students apply for financial aid and pick majors. On weekends, she volunteers as a coach for the new swim team at a small Christian college nearby. It’s a small team of mostly novice swimmers, and Knutson thinks they don’t know her background. She doesn’t swim anymore; she prefers running.  “It feels like another human swam. It doesn’t feel like it was me. I used to have this   and this pride . . . I felt unstoppable,” she said. “I don’t feel that way anymore. ” During the Olympics this summer, Knutson was busy at work, so she missed most of it. She kept track online, to see how her former teammates fared.  One night, she watched highlights on her phone as she walked to her car after a long day at the office. In Rio that day,    Maya DiRado won an upset gold medal in the 200 backstroke. DiRado also silvered in two of Knutson’s old events, the 200 and 400 individual medley. Knutson was thrilled for DiRado, her former teammate from the junior national team.  As Knutson drove home that night, she wept. "
142555,218068,2016: One year in the Upside Down,Washington Post,Dan Zak,2016-12-30,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161231004909/https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/2016-one-year-in-the-upside-down/2016/12/30/4935304a-c6d5-11e6-bf4b-2c064d32a4bf_story.html
","      The year started ominously, with a big fire in a big hotel in the Middle East. Remember? You were getting dressed for a party in the waning hours of 2015 and glimpsed cable news in the mirror, where an orange blaze licked the black sky near the Burj Khalifa in Dubai. The fireworks show went as planned: artful magenta flashes arching through a drifting wall of smoke. That would be 2016 in a single image. Spectacle upon spectacle. A band of armed ranchers trapped themselves in an Oregon wildlife refuge, in the name of freedom. The United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union, in the name of solidarity. A woman who represents the mythical illuminati funded by George Soros was beaten to the White House by a man who brags about sexual assault. The woman fled to the woods. The man withdrew to an upper floor of his dark tower, to plan. The year was like a movie. Maybe the year was a movie, and we’ve finally closed the   gap between reality and entertainment. America in 2016 was an episode of “Stranger Things,” with its alternate reality called the Upside Down  —   from which we try to communicate with the other side via flashing Christmas lights. We were always minutes away from a shocking plot twist, and the twists came so fast that we had to keep reminding ourselves of the basic order of the universe. “This isn’t normal,” people said when white supremacists did a Nazi salute to Donald Trump during a conference on Pennsylvania Avenue. “This isn’t normal,” people said when the temperature at the North Pole registered 50 degrees above average. “This isn’t normal,” people said when the North Carolina legislature threw out the public so it could pass restrictions on the incoming governor’s powers.  Yes, there were hints of normalcy: Kanye had some kind of breakdown. Terrorists attacked airports in Brussels and Istanbul. Beyoncé slayed on top of a sinking police cruiser. Gunmen rampaged in Kalamazoo, Mich. and Hesston, Kan. and Burlington, Wash. and killed cops in Dallas and Baton Rouge. In this way, 2016 could’ve been any year. In June, a radicalized native of Long Island killed 49 people at a gay club in Orlando.  . The number itself doesn’t have the impact as does counting to it. One. Two. Three. Four. Five. Six. Seven. Eight. Nine. Ten. Eleven . . . You get the picture. Or maybe you don’t. Over half a million people signed an online petition titled “Justice for Harambe,” the gorilla killed by the Cincinnati Zoo in May. Just 1, 200 people signed a similar petition titled “Justice for Philando Castile,” a beloved school cafeteria manager who was shot by a police officer on Facebook Live in July. The summer is ancient history now. The images and words before Nov. 8 look like relics from a different era, when we talked naively about togetherness, about firsts, about making America great again  —   and ignored anyone who didn’t like what we had to say.     Friends and family members embrace outside the Orlando Police headquarters during the investigation of a shooting at Pulse nightclub that took place on June 12. (Steve  )     Eric Fanning, right, became the first openly gay secretary of a U. S. military branch. He attended the Kennedy Center Honors on Dec. 4 with his partner, Ben  . (Jahi   Washington Post)    But let’s try to remember some of those firsts, for posterity. The Treasury announced that Harriet Tubman will become the first black person commemorated on a U. S. bank note. Eric Fanning became the first openly gay secretary of a U. S. military branch. Minneapolis elected the country’s first Somali American legislator; London elected the first Muslim mayor of a major Western capital; the Democrats nominated the first female presidential candidate of a major U. S. party  —   and she was as reviled as her opponent, who had no political or military experience but exercised his knack for getting under people’s skin.  The year was haunted by a sense of doom conjured by the candidates themselves, who argued that choosing the other would summon the apocalypse. And so each celebrity death was greeted, with black humor, as an act of prudence. David Bowie and Prince were fed up with our national hissy fit, our utter lack of cool. The greatest, Muhammad Ali, left to escape the worst. Leonard Cohen  —   “ah, the wars, they will be fought again”  —   died the day before the election. Gwen Ifill, paragon of journalism, a week after. The soul singer Sharon Jones, a cancer survivor who turned “This Land Is Your Land” into a funk anthem, had a stroke while watching the election returns, and died 10 days later. In the final week of the year, George Michael and Carrie Fisher scurried out as if a door was closing, but maybe a history of hard living was to blame, not 2016 itself. It’s more difficult to dwell on good news. This year the unemployment rate dropped to a   low! The Dow rocketed past 19, 000! Giant pandas are no longer endangered! The Cubs and Cavs won!  Alas, joy is sanded down by the relentless   news cycle, the barbed hamster wheel of social media, the outrages that distract from catastrophes. Much of Flint still does not have drinking water. Much of West Virginia is drowning in opioids. Most of Aleppo is rubble. Chicago exceeded 700 homicides for the first time in almost two decades. The Internet didn’t know or care much, though. The year’s top searches on Google, counting down: 5. Powerball 4. Prince 3. Donald Trump 2. iPhone 7 1. Pokémon Go The year as a Hollywood pitch meeting: Which sounds better as the premise for a show on Netflix or HBO? A) Gravitational waves are detected a billion   from Earth, confirming both Einstein’s general theory of relativity and mankind’s intergalactic ingenuity. B) Hillary Clinton runs a child sex ring out of a series of dungeons and tunnels under Washington, and Russia helps elect Donald Trump to win the Cold War 25 years after we thought it ended. The calendar year may have reached its finale, but the show has been renewed for another season. We will continue to binge. On the next episode: a new president looks out the windows of his new residence. In the distance, in the Upside Down, is a monument to George Washington, an electric January sky, and tens of thousands of nasty women. "

","       Donald Trump, having dismissed as “ridiculous” and “just another excuse” the conclusion by intelligence experts that Russia intervened in the election to help him win; having suggested that the culprit who hacked into the Democratic emails “could be somebody sitting in a bed someplace”; having advised, most recently, that “it’s time for our country to move on,” has “nevertheless” graciously agreed to take time out from meeting with the likes of Don King to consider the evidence implicating Russia. Thanks Donald. The most disturbing thing about Russia’s interference with the U. S. election  —   whether or not it had the desired effect  —   is Russia’s interference. The second most disturbing thing  —   and now that he is about to be president, it is a pretty close second  —   is Trump’s obstinate, unyielding refusal to accept the unanimous conclusion of U. S. intelligence experts that Russia was behind the hacking. No new president wants to take office with a shadow on the legitimacy of his election (and, to be clear, I accept that Trump was elected and will be president). So Trump’s instinctive bristling at this storyline may be understandable. But Trump has been taking pains for months to dismiss reports of Russian involvement  —   except, of course, when he was encouraging the Russians to do even more of it.  But being   and being president requires, or should require, rising above pique and defensiveness. The responsible course, from the start, would have been to express concern, indeed alarm, about the reports, not to shoot them down. The responsible course, as   would have been to criticize Russia, not to suggest, falsely, that the question had not arisen during the campaign (“If Russia, or some other entity, was hacking, why did the White House wait so long to act? ”) or that hackers, unless caught in the act, cannot be reliably identified. The responsible course would be to insist that this kind of behavior cannot be tolerated and must be punished. It would be to call, not for moving on, but for drilling down, to understand what a foreign power, a hostile foreign power, did in connection with an American election. That is not the Trump course, nor the course of Trump lieutenants. On CNN Thursday, Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway dismissed the debate as an effort to “fight the last war,” and blamed its victim. “This is really about the DNC’s breach,” she said. “They didn’t have the proper security   …     and someone was able to hack the information. We are not in favor of foreign governments interfering in our elections or interfering in our intelligence. But we’re also not in favor of our intelligence interfering with elections after the fact. ” Is that what she thinks is happening, that this is about intelligence agencies’ interfering with the election? Is that what Trump thinks is happening?  The   appears unwilling to see this issue, perhaps incapable of seeing it, in any way except in terms of his own personal politics. Asked about Sen. Lindsey Graham’s ( . C.) call for sanctions against Russia, Trump went low: “As you know, he ran against me. ” But this isn’t about Trump’s political prowess; it’s about Russia’s meddling in U. S. elections. House Speaker Paul D. Ryan ( .) in a statement after President Obama’s announcement of sanctions, stated that “Russia does not share America’s interests. In fact, it has consistently sought to undermine them, sowing dangerous instability around the world. ”   Trump: agree or disagree?"

","     President Obama’s decision to abstain at the U. N. Security Council on a   resolution asserting Israel is an international   followed by Secretary of State John Kerry’s speech haranguing the democratically elected government of Israel, marked a low point, however brief, in U. S.  relations and confirmed the president’s irrational   sentiments. (In leaving office, the abstention served no rational purpose; it was rather an international temper tantrum.) Israel replied with the harshest words ever uttered to an American president. (“The Obama Administration conducted a shameful   ambush at the U. N.,” Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said of the action at the United Nations. As for Kerry’s speech, he declared, “Secretary Kerry paid lip service to the unremitting campaign of terrorism that has been waged by the Palestinians against the Jewish State for nearly a century. What he did was spend most of his speech blaming Israel for the lack of peace by passionately condemning a policy of enabling Jews to live in their historic homeland and in their eternal capital, Jerusalem. ”) Arab reaction was lukewarm to Kerry, reaffirming the conclusion that Obama managed to alienate both sides in the   conflict. Bipartisan criticism in the United States rained down on the administration. So once again the administration demonstrated how isolated it is from its own party when it comes to Israel. Then came the blast from Britain. A spokesman for Prime Minister Theresa May declared, “We do not   …     believe that the way to negotiate peace is by focusing on only one issue. And we do not believe that it is appropriate to attack the composition of the   government of an ally. ” The statement reiterated that “we are also clear that the settlements are far from the only problem in this conflict. In particular, the people of Israel deserve to live free from the threat of terrorism, with which they have had to cope for too long. ” Now, Britain signed onto the U. N. resolution, so why the reaction to the speech? Former deputy national security adviser Elliott Abrams told Right Turn, “What they thought completely wrong was his criticism of the governing coalition in Israel for being too right wing. It is simply unacceptable to criticize a democratically elected allied government that way  —   and the British realize it, even if Kerry doesn’t. ” It is also a telling reminder that the U. S. president matters. Our allies get the message when an incoming president is exceptionally   and openly deplored Obama’s   move against the Jewish State. One can imagine  —   as happened in the George W. Bush administration  —   that once America sends out the word that this kind of attack on Israel is unacceptable and will have consequences for those who join, we will likely see fewer of them. A U. S. president sets foreign policy but also a tone in international dealings. If the message from   Donald Trump to the world that “you have no better friend than the U. S. and no worse enemy” is followed by deliberate, forceful action, other countries will adjust. It is for this very same reason that Democrats and Republicans alike are greatly worried about Trump’s utterances and tone regarding Russia. There, things really could get worse as Putin plays Trump (as he did by resisting retaliatory sanctions) like a fine violin."

","  CHARLOTTESVILLE   I came here during the holidays to visit an old friend who’s fallen on hard times. Amid the cultural sensation of   Miranda’s “Hamilton” on Broadway, the protagonist’s   Thomas Jefferson, has momentarily lost his place of honor in the founding narrative. If Alexander Hamilton is the hero, the Sage of Monticello, though not the villain (that’s Aaron Burr) is an impediment. In truth, Jefferson and Hamilton were indispensable, the yin and yang of American democracy: Jefferson’s love of liberty and Hamilton’s taste for centralized power created the balance that built the world’s economic and military superpower. And they had common cause in defending their creation. Their system was under threat in 1800, when a quirk in the electoral college left the   House of Representatives to award the presidency to one of two republicans, Jefferson and Burr. Miranda portrayed Hamilton as reluctantly drawn out of retirement to endorse Jefferson, but Hamilton’s letters show he was zealous in persuading fellow federalists to choose Jefferson  —   a man with whom he had more ideological differences than with Burr. The danger to the new country, Hamilton argued, wasn’t ideological disputes, but the possibility that an unprincipled man would exploit public passions. He called Burr a   Catiline, the ancient Roman senator who attempted a populist uprising against the Republic.  Hamilton’s letters from 216 winters ago, which I   this week, provide much relevance to this moment, as our 45th president assumes office.  Hamilton was no apologist for Jefferson, whose politics were “tinctured with fanaticism,” and who was “a contemptible hypocrite. ” But, Hamilton wrote to Federalist James Bayard of Delaware, Jefferson is not “zealot enough to do anything in pursuance of his principles which will contravene his popularity, or his interest. He is as likely as any man I know to temporize  —   to calculate what will be likely to promote his own reputation and advantage; and the probable result of such a temper is the preservation of systems, though originally opposed, which being once established, could not be overturned without danger to the person who did it. . . . Add to this that there is no fair reason to suppose him capable of being corrupted, which is a security that he will not go beyond certain limits. ”  Some Federalists thought the   Burr would be more malleable. But, Hamilton countered, a man without theory cannot be “a systematic or able statesman. ” Burr is “more cunning than wise . . . inferior in real ability to Jefferson,” Hamilton wrote. “Great Ambition unchecked by principle . . . is an unruly Tyrant. ” The former Treasury secretary warned that Burr’s trafficking in “the floating passions of the multitude” would lead him to “endeavour to disorganize both parties & to form out of them a third composed of men fitted by their characters to be conspirators. ”  Hamilton recounted that when Burr was told something wasn’t permissible under the American system, Burr replied “les grands ames se soucient peu des petits morceaux”  —   great souls care little about small things. This led Hamilton to conclude that “Burr would consider a scheme of usurpation as visionary. ”  Hamilton issued similar warnings in the winter of   to James Ross of Pennsylvania, John Rutledge Jr. of South Carolina, Oliver Wolcott Jr. of Connecticut and Gouverneur Morris of New York. To restrain Burr, Hamilton wrote Morris, would be “to bind a Giant by a cobweb. ”  Certainly there was personal enmity between Hamilton and the bankrupt “voluptuary” he called Burr. But underlying Hamilton’s aggressive campaign for Jefferson was a fear that America’s democracy was too fragile to survive Burr’s ambition.  “He is of a temper to undertake the most hazardous enterprises because he is sanguine enough to think nothing impracticable, and of an ambition which will be content with nothing less than permanent power in his own hands,” he wrote Bayard. “The maintenance of the existing institutions will not suit him, because under them his power will be too narrow & too precarious; yet the innovations he may attempt will not offer the substitute of a system durable & safe, calculated to give lasting prosperity, & to unite liberty with strength. It will be the system of the day, sufficient to serve his own turn, & not looking beyond himself. ”  “The truth,” Hamilton wrote, “is that under forms of Government like ours, too much is practicable to men who will without scruple avail themselves of the bad passions of human nature. ”  Hamilton’s view of Burr would later become universal. Jefferson would come to see his former running mate as “one of the most flagitious [villainous] of which history will ever furnish an example. ”  Hamilton’s intervention gave the country the triumphant presidency of Jefferson, sparing the young nation an unscrupulous man exploiting public passion to usurp power.

","     Torn between impatience for 2016 to be over already and dread of what might come in 2017? Roger that, America. In fact, if there’s one nation in Europe that feels the same way, it’s my country, Germany. Across the West, 2016 saw disasters, wars, roiling election campaigns, faltering governments, ruthless meddling by foreign powers, and surging populism fueled by anger, fear and the corrosion of trust in public institutions. A harsh and violent year by any measure. On top of it all, David Bowie and Leonard Cohen died. Compared to the turmoil in Turkey, or the United States’ raucous election season, Germany seemed an island of (relative) social harmony and security for most of the year. Until December 18, when Tunisian Anis Amri rammed a Polish haulage truck into a bustling Christmas market on Breitscheidplatz in the heart of Berlin, killing 12 people and wounding nearly 50 others. That day, Germany joined the ranks of other Western nations that have seen major Islamist terrorist attacks: the United States, Spain, England, Belgium, France. The attack itself is not a turning point. It was not Germany’s first terrorist incident, and attacks in other countries have claimed more lives. The calm, even sarcastic reactions of ordinary Berliners suggest that people are refusing to be intimidated. The authorities, from the police to Chancellor Anglea Merkel, have behaved steadfastly and professionally. It was always understood that Germany was not likely to remain exempt from Islamist terrorism. Not least because its welcoming of Syrian refugees has been a slap in the face for the Islamic State’s false narrative of victimization by the West. The larger significance of the Berlin attack lies in the fact that it is only the latest instance this year of events puncturing central aspects of Germany’s postwar narrative of itself  —   something the German journalist Andreas Rinke pointed out recently. He calls them Lebenslügen  —      —   but that is too harsh. Germany’s   history of war, genocide, crimes against humanity, fascism, communism, and nearly 50 years of partition gave Germans good reasons to construct their postwar republic on the basis of firm founding principles of separation of powers, protection of minorities, rule of law at home, plus a commitment to Europe and Western alliances abroad. But Rinke is absolutely correct in saying that these foundations were under fire in 2016 like never before. Postwar (West) Germany cultivated a special relationship with its Western neighbor, France, based on atonement and reconciliation; this   friendship became the motor of Europe. Later, Germany bent over backward to do the same with its eastern neighbor, Poland. But today, France is preoccupied with a deep reform malaise and the rise of the   Front National. And an authoritarian Polish government looks askance at Berlin’s overtures. As a country that sits at the heart of the continent, shares borders with nine nations and trades with all of Europe, it was only logical for Germany to pursue ever deeper integration of the European Union. This year’s Brexit vote brought those hopes to a shuddering, gasping halt. London was a key ally for Berlin on free trade. That relationship is now badly damaged, too. True, Germany has done a lot for the European Union: It held together the sanctions against Russia, at no small cost to German business. It faced down the euro crisis, and took on a massive migrant influx almost on its own. Yet it also bred resentment, with unilateral decisions that affected neighbors (such as opening its doors to the refugees) or its   treatment of Greece. If Berlin is more lonely today, that is partly its own fault. Germany’s hardwired preference for dialogue in foreign policy took a knocking this year as well. In Syria, it tried to support peace talks  —   to no avail. It took the lead in brokering the Minsk II agreement between Russia and Ukraine in 2014, and volunteered for the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe chair in 2016. But at best, it achieved a freezing of the status quo, while violence in the Donbass region continues. It is now scrambling to reinvest in deterrence and defense. Germany’s other lodestar was the United States. That bred a relationship of   that was equally cozy and resentful, and let Germany   on U. S. security. Berlin has recently attempted to become a more responsible, capable and strategic partner. It seems the incoming president will be far less appreciative of this development than President Obama was. Donald Trump has rejected free trade, globalization, international law  —   all essential to Germany’s relations with the world. 2016 was also the year that punctured complacency about the superior excellence of our democracy. Yes, my country is still doing a magnificent job integrating hundreds of thousands of refugees. It is responding to the Berlin attack by giving domestic security more muscle. But our own   populist party, the Alternative for Germany (AfD) now sits in 10 out of 16 state legislatures, and polls nationwide at 13 percent. All this makes for a glum outlook for Germany in 2017. Many disappointed American liberals see us as the last bastion of liberal democracy. Thanks, but there is real reason to fear a protest vote in the national election next fall (the date is not yet set). Our intelligence services have warned of Russian intentions to meddle. Helpfully, the American   appears to be taking a keen interest as well. Small wonder Merkel hesitated before announcing that she would run for a fourth term in 2017. One thing is for sure: She, and ordinary Germans, can’t be (in the words of David Bowie’s most famous Berlin song) “heroes forever and ever. ” We could use some luck. Or some friends."

","   Naureen Shah is director of security and human rights at Amnesty International USA.    The Obama administration is dismantling a homeland security program created to track immigrants from   countries in an attempt to prevent   Donald Trump from fulfilling his campaign promise to create a Muslim registry. As an American Muslim and human rights advocate, I am hoping against hope that retired Gen. John F. Kelly, the homeland security secretary nominee, will not reassemble the program. Kelly is not an obvious champion of human rights. As head of U. S. Southern Command, Kelly oversaw Guantanamo, where he frequently dismissed human rights concerns. Dozens of people languished in detention without charge, and many were   after going on hunger strikes. But he could be our best hope in the Trump administration.  While at Southern Command, Kelly invited critiques from human rights groups. Every year, he asked Amnesty International and other organizations to join him for a frank roundtable discussion. After one meeting, he took me aside to explain his point of view and hear me out. Dialogue and decency: In today’s   political climate, these are as rare as unicorns. And they matter. If I could talk to Kelly today, I think he’d listen. I would tell him that people are afraid. Activists worry that if they speak out, the government could retaliate or put them under surveillance. Trump’s idle tweets about stripping people of citizenship for   are eerily reminiscent of foreign dictators threatening to jail people for peaceful dissent. People like me  —   ordinary Americans with Muslim names and ancestry from   countries  —   fear being put on a watchlist, barred entry into the United States, even banned because of who we are. Many people  —   African Americans, Jewish Americans, Muslim Americans, immigrants who’ve spent most of their adult lives here  —   spent the holidays swapping stories of threats, harassment and even violent attacks by fellow Americans who think the election has given them license to act on hatred. I believe Kelly would listen to me, not because he has ever agreed with me, but because he has been willing to talk. And a top national security official who values dialogue over diatribes is what we need to put the brakes on Trump’s most frightening counterterrorism proposals.  Kelly must not revive NSEERS (the National Security   Registration System). He is a smart man  —   he knows that a special registry would make for bad counterterrorism. Law enforcement officials need people to trust them and tip them off, not fear and avoid them. A special registration would send shockwaves through immigrant communities, inviting uncertainty and anxiety, more fear of law enforcement and less safety.   Unlike some of Trump’s other national security advisers, though, Kelly does not appear to be infected with bizarrely virulent   prejudice. And more than anything, the proposed Muslim ban, internment and special registration proposals are about prejudice  —   not safety. They cater to bigotry and fear, which fly in the face of our country’s most precious values. They tear at the seams of our commonality by implying that only some people are included in the ideals of liberty and justice. They drive people even farther apart from each other, after an election that already has left us fragmented.  It may be naive to think that Kelly  —   or anyone else in the Trump administration  —   would risk his career to stand in the way of   rights proposals. But many of these proposals, only a short while ago, would have been considered unimaginable. They threaten to return this country to the grimmest chapters of our history, like the mass imprisonment of U. S. citizens and noncitizens of Japanese descent. They are the stuff of dystopic novels, of nightmares. Kelly could reject the bigotry and irrationality of these proposals, and senators at his confirmation hearing should call on him to do so. The next secretary of homeland security can refuse to carry forward Trump’s   policies, and also decline to cooperate with the FBI or any other agency on the surveillance of activists, immigrants or particular communities. Perhaps most important, the general could use his position to counteract advisers who may tell Trump that he needn’t listen to the millions of Americans who support human rights and civil liberties. Kelly was always willing to listen to the human rights community. Now, I’m hoping that the   will listen to him.

"," ALTHOUGH PRESIDENT Obama’s sanctions against Russia for interfering with the U. S. presidential election came late, his action on Thursday reflected a bipartisan consensus that penalties must be imposed for Moscow’s audacious hacking and meddling. But one prominent voice in the United States reacted differently.   Donald Trump said “it’s time for our country to move on to bigger and better things. ” Earlier in the week, he asserted that the “whole age of computer has made it where nobody knows exactly what is going on. ” No, Mr. Trump, it is not time to move on. U. S. intelligence agencies are in agreement about “what is going on”: a brazen and unprecedented attempt by a hostile power to covertly sway the outcome of a U. S. presidential election through the theft and release of material damaging to Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. The  ’s dismissive response only deepens unanswered questions about his ties to Russia in the past and his plans for cooperation with Vladi mir Putin. For his part, Mr. Putin seems to be eagerly anticipating the Trump presidency. On Friday, he promised to withhold retaliatory sanctions, clearly hoping the new Trump administration will nullify Mr. Obama’s acts. Then Mr. Trump cheered on Twitter: “Great move on delay (by V. Putin)  —   I always knew he was very smart!” For any American leader, an attempt to subvert U. S. democracy ought to be unforgivable  —   even if he is the intended beneficiary. Some years ago,   Secretary Leon Panetta warned of a “  Harbor,” and the fear at the time was of a cyberattack collapsing electric grids or crashing financial markets. Now we have a real   Harbor, though not one that was anticipated. Mr. Obama has pledged a thorough investigation and disclosure; the information released on Thursday does not go far enough. Congress should not shrink from establishing a select committee for a   probe. Mr. Obama also hinted at additional retaliation, possibly unannounced, and we believe it would be justified to deter future mischief. How about shedding a little sunshine on Mr. Putin’s hidden wealth and that of his coterie?  Mr. Trump has been frank about his desire to improve relations with Russia, but he seems blissfully untroubled by the reasons for the deterioration in relations, including Russia’s instigation of an armed uprising in Ukraine, its seizure of Crimea, its efforts to divide Europe and the crushing of democracy and human rights at home.  Why is Mr. Trump so dismissive of Russia’s dangerous behavior? Some say it is his lack of experience in foreign policy, or an   admiration for strongmen, or naivete about Russian intentions. But darker suspicions persist. Mr. Trump has steadfastly refused to be transparent about his   business empire. Are there loans or deals with Russian businesses or the state that were concealed during the campaign? Are there hidden communications with Mr. Putin or his representatives? We would be thrilled to see all the doubts dispelled, but Mr. Trump’s odd behavior in the face of a clear threat from Russia, matched by Mr. Putin’s evident enthusiasm for the   cannot be easily explained.

142562,218075,British leader Theresa May breaks with John Kerry’s condemnation of Israel,Washington Post,Michael Birnbaum,2016-12-30,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161231004909/https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/britains-leaderbreaks-with-kerrys-condemnation-of-israel/2016/12/30/33371564-ce97-11e6-a87f-b917067331bb_story.html
","  BRUSSELS  —   British Prime Minister Theresa May condemned a blunt speech this week by Secretary of State John F. Kerry on the state of the   conflict, an unusual move that boosted Britain’s relations with the incoming Trump administration at the expense of President Obama. The rare diplomatic spat between Britain and the United States, which was met with surprise by the State Department, highlighted the   influence of the   White House. It also pointed to a vast reordering of international affairs expected after Trump takes office in three weeks, as U. S. allies position themselves to curry favor in the new order. The transatlantic split was particularly unexpected given that May’s government acted as a key broker between U. S. and Palestinian interests ahead of a U. N. Security Council vote last week to declare Israeli settlement construction “illegal. ” British diplomats worked as   in shaping the measure to ensure that the language was acceptable to the United States, Britain’s Guardian and Israel’s Haaretz newspapers reported this week. Kerry on Wednesday offered a harsh assessment of the government of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, saying that “his current coalition is the most   in Israeli history, with an agenda driven by its most extreme elements. ” He criticized persistent Israel settlement expansion on the West Bank as a threat to the “  solution” under which Israel and a new Palestinian state would coexist side by side.        (Reuters)   May’s office retorted that “we do not believe that it is appropriate to attack the composition of the democratically elected government of an ally. ” It said in an emailed statement late Thursday that “we are also clear that the settlements are far from the only problem in this conflict. In particular, the people of Israel deserve to live free from the threat of terrorism, with which they have had to cope for too long. ” The move was an olive branch both to Netanyahu and to   Donald Trump, who railed against the Obama administration’s decision to abstain from a U. N. Security Council resolution condemning the settlements and who has urged Israel to “stay strong” until he assumes office Jan. 20. Trump has expressed   support for actions by the Israeli government, breaking with   U. S. policy that has sought a middle ground between the two sides.   Kerry’s speech and the U. S. abstention in the Security Council vote were received warmly by Germany and France, among other European nations, which led to a stunned reaction in Washington to the message from May’s office. “We are surprised by the U. K. Prime Minister’s office statement given that Secretary Kerry’s remarks  —   which covered the full range of threats to a   solution, including terrorism, violence, incitement and settlements  —   were in line with the U. K.’s own longstanding policy and its vote at the United Nations last week,” the State Department said in a statement. British leaders have publicly embraced Trump since his victory last month, despite his urging that Nigel Farage, a lead campaigner for Britain’s exit from the European Union and a thorn in the side of the British government, be named British ambassador to Washington. Britain, which is preparing to negotiate the terms of a messy exit from the E. U. is hoping that a strong economic relationship with the United States will help smooth out the disruptions from leaving the union’s common market. During his presidential campaign, Trump praised Britain’s vote to leave the European Union and took to calling himself “Mr. Brexit. ”      (Reuters)   This week, Britain’s ambassador in Washington, Kim Darroch, expressed hope that Trump and May would build “on the legacy of previous leaders such as President Reagan and Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. ” Kerry’s   speech Wednesday was unusual in its breadth and frankness, coming from a man who devoted much of his energy as the top U. S. diplomat toward   negotiations that were ultimately abandoned.  Kerry said Wednesday that Israeli settlement activity, which has accelerated in recent years, was extending far into the West Bank, “in the middle of what, by any reasonable definition, would be the future Palestinian state. ” “No one thinking seriously about peace can ignore the reality of what the settlements pose to that peace,” he said. The speech came at a historic low in relations between Israel and the United States, the Jewish state’s staunchest international ally. The Obama administration intended the abstention on the U. N. resolution as a warning sign to the Netanyahu government that international support would not be unconditional, as settlement populations swell on territory extending beyond the   armistice lines that defined Israel’s boundaries. The Australian government also distanced itself Friday from the Obama administration’s stance on settlements and the U. N. resolution. Australia supports negotiations leading to two independent states, Foreign Minister Julie Bishop told the Australian Broadcasting Corp. But she said that Australia  —   which is not a member of the Security Council where the vote was taken  —   did not support the U. N. resolution condemning settlements. “In voting at the U. N. the coalition government has consistently not supported   resolutions targeting Israel,” the statement said. The impending realignment of U. S. foreign policy that apparently led to the rare break between Downing Street and the White House could also be seen Friday in Russia, where President Vladimir Putin opted not to retaliate publicly against fresh U. S. sanctions and the expulsion of 35 Russian diplomats from U. S. territory. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov had recommended Friday the expulsion of 35 U. S. diplomats in retaliation. But Putin appears to be banking on markedly warmer relations with Trump. The   has praised the Kremlin and expressed disbelief at an assessment by the U. S. intelligence community that    hackers were responsible for the leaks of sensitive emails from Democratic Party officials in a bid to help Trump win the White House.

142563,218076,China’s vow to shut down its ivory trade by the end of 2017 is a ‘game changer’ for elephants,Washington Post,Simon Denyer,2016-12-30,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161231004909/https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/china-vows-to-shut-down-ivory-trade-by-end-of-2017-offering-hope-for-elephants/2016/12/30/9b26a330-ceae-11e6-85cd-e66532e35a44_story.html
","   BEIJING  —   China promised Friday to halt its domestic ivory trade completely by the end of 2017, a decision greeted by environmentalists as offering real hope for an end to a poaching crisis that is wiping out tens of thousands of elephants across Africa.  “China’s announcement is a game changer for elephant conservation,” Carter Roberts, president of the World Wildlife Fund, said in a statement. “The   trade of ivory now faces its twilight years, and the future is brighter for wild elephants. ”  China said it would begin phasing out the ivory trade in March and cease processing and trading completely by Dec. 31, 2017. The Natural Resources Defense Council, a New   environmental advocacy group, said the news “may be the biggest sign of hope for elephants since the current poaching crisis began,” while Grace Ge Gabriel, Asia director at the International Fund for Animal Welfare, said she was “overwhelmed with joy. ” “This is great news that will shut down the world’s largest market for elephant ivory,” said Aili Kang, Asia director at the Wildlife Conservation Society. “Ivory traffickers have just lost one of their biggest markets. ”   Customs officers seize ivory tusks, rhino horn and leopard skins at the Hong Kong customs headquarters in 2013. (Alex Hofford)   It is a huge step for a country that had previously argued that ivory carving was part of its cultural heritage and where intricately carved ivory items had become popular gifts to grease the wheels of government and business. The government was moved not just by international pressure but also by changing attitudes among ordinary Chinese. Celebrities such as former NBA star Yao Ming have led campaigns to “stop the buying” of ivory  —   and simply to educate people that elephants had to die for the ivory to be taken. There was also a realization that China’s key role in the illicit ivory trade was damaging its image in Africa. After the market is shuttered, the Chinese Ministry of Culture will help ivory sector employees find other jobs, for example, encouraging “master carvers” to work in museums to help repair and maintain significant ivory works of art, the statement said. The government also pledged to ramp up law enforcement, and educate the public to reject ivory. Peter Knights, chief executive of WildAid, a San   group at the forefront of efforts to change Chinese attitudes toward the ivory trade, called it the “best possible news for Africa’s elephants” and congratulated President Xi Jinping for his leadership on the issue. Although poaching may have peaked a few years ago, some 20, 000 African elephants continue to be killed for their tusks every year, experts say, largely to meet demand from Asia, and particularly China, for ivory. Africa’s elephant population has dwindled from about 1. 2 million 35 years ago to between 400, 000 and 500, 000 now. Central African forest elephants could be extinct within the next decade if current trends continue, while Tanzania’s elephant population fell by 60 percent between 2009 and 2014, census data showed.   An elephant walks through the bush at the Southern African Wildlife College. (Denis  )  The global trade, thought to be worth around $10 billion annually, is run by international criminal syndicates, sometimes with help from African rebel groups. But even if a ban is enforced in China, some experts warn that the trade could shift across the border into neighboring Laos, Vietnam and Burma, where large markets flourish selling endangered wildlife products to Chinese consumers. There is also a danger of traders passing off elephant ivory as legal mammoth ivory. Still, a clear signal from the Chinese government is seen as going a long way toward making ivory as unfashionable here as it is in the West.  China retains a small stock of legal ivory purchased in 2008, when international trade in it was allowed. The state has been gradually supplying that ivory to carving workshops and selling it domestically. But this legal business, experts say, has provided cover for a vast underground trade network.  The announcement follows a pledge by Xi and President Obama in September 2015 to end the domestic trade in ivory in their respective countries. Hong Kong, another major hub for ivory smuggling, announced last week that it would raise maximum penalties for wildlife crime to 10 years and phase out its own trade in ivory by the end of 2021  —   although pressure may now mount for it to move more quickly. In January 2014, China signaled how official attitudes were changing by staging a ceremony to crush six tons of tusks and carved ivory ornaments that had been seized in   operations. The United States has largely closed down its own ivory market by banning trade at the federal level and in several states, but experts said it still needs to do more in terms of enforcement. The last bastion of the trade is now Japan, said Knights, of WildAid. He urged global opponents of the trade to shift their attention there.       "

","     The decision was not an easy one, wrote Jan Chamberlin. Ever since “the announcement”  —   as Chamberlin called it  —   she has “spent several sleepless nights and days in turmoil and agony,” she wrote in a Facebook post that was no longer public by Friday evening. “I have reflected carefully on both sides of the issue, prayed a lot, talked with family and friends, and searched my soul. I’ve tried to tell myself that by not going to the inauguration, that I would be able to stay in Choir for all the other good reasons. ” Ultimately, though, Chamberlin decided that she could not stay in the Mormon Tabernacle Choir. The Salt Lake City Tribune reported that Chamberlin, a singer in the famed group, is resigning after learning that the choir would appear at   Donald Trump’s inauguration in January. “I simply cannot continue with the recent turn of events,” she wrote on Facebook. “I could never look myself in the mirror again with self respect. ” Chamberlin wrote that by “singing for this man” the choir would appear to be “endorsing” tyranny and fascism, and its image would be “severely damaged. ” Moreover, she wrote, it would leave many feeling betrayed, as she already did.  In the post, Chamberlin also appeared to compare Trump to Adolf Hitler, writing that “history is repeating itself. ” “I only know I could never ‘throw roses to Hitler,’ ” wrote Chamberlin, who did not immediately return a request seeking comment Friday. “And I certainly could never sing for him. ”    The Mormon Tabernacle Choir announced earlier this month that it would be performing at Trump’s inauguration ceremony. The volunteer choir has performed at the   ceremonies or inaugural parades for George H. W. Bush, Richard Nixon, Lyndon Johnson, George W. Bush and Ronald Reagan, according to its website. “The Mormon Tabernacle Choir has a great tradition of performing at the inaugurals of U. S. presidents,” Ron Jarrett, the choir’s president, said on the site. “Singing the music of America is one of the things we do best. We are honored to be able to serve our country by providing music for the inauguration of our next president. ”    President George H. W. Bush invited the Mormon Tabernacle Choir to perform at his 1989 inauguration. (Photo courtesy of Mormon Tabernacle Choir)  Eric Hawkins, spokesman for the Church of Jesus Christ of   Saints, said in an email that participating in the choir is voluntary. That includes performing at Trump’s inauguration, Hawkins wrote. A limited number of choir members are expected to appear there, and none of the members are required to participate in the ceremony. “Response to the announcement has been mixed, with people expressing both opposition and support,” Hawkins said in the email. “The choir’s participation continues its long tradition of performing for U. S. presidents of both parties at inaugurations and in other settings, and is not an implied support of party affiliations or politics. It is a demonstration of our support for freedom, civility and the peaceful transition of power. ”  After the choir’s performance was announced, the Salt Lake City Tribune wrote that the group “has performed at a presidential inauguration, but it is likely the most controversial. ” An online petition against the church’s decision to let the choir perform argued that did not “reflect the values of Mormonism and does not represent its diverse 15+ million members worldwide. ” “As members and friends of The Church of Jesus Christ of   Saints, we strongly urge the Church to stop this practice and especially for an incoming president who has demonstrated sexist, racist, misogynistic, and xenophobic behavior that does not align with the principles and teachings of The Church of Jesus Christ of   Saints,” read the petition, which has been signed by more than 25, 000 people. The Washington Post’s Julie Zauzmer took at look at Mormon support for Trump after the choir’s participation in the inaugural was announced. Wrote Zauzmer: Mormons opposed Trump’s candidacy for president more than any other traditionally conservative religious groups. Ordinarily strong supporters of Republican candidates  —   80 percent of Mormons voted for George W. Bush in 2004, and 78 percent voted for fellow Mormon Mitt Romney in 2012  —   far fewer Mormons voted for Trump. According to an exit poll, 61 percent of Mormons picked Trump, and 25 percent voted for Hillary Clinton. A large number voted for   candidates, especially Evan McMullin, a Mormon and a former CIA agent who mounted a   independent bid. “We’re honored to have the Mormon Tabernacle Choir perform in the 58th Inauguration, their sixth time participating in inaugural ceremonies, and we look forward to their uplifting performance,” Boris Epshteyn, the Presidential Inaugural Committee’s director of communications, said in an emailed statement, when the committee was asked about Chamberlin’s decision. The news comes not long after the Radio City Rockettes, who are also expected to appear at the inauguration, encountered some backlash for their scheduled performance. The Madison Square Garden Co. which employs the dancers, said in late December that the Rockettes would participate in the inauguration in January, but the announcement left some expressing concerns over social media. The company said members of the dance group are not being forced to participate.        Donald Trump will be sworn into office during the 58th inauguration on Jan. 20. Here’s a look at what we know about the planned inaugural activities and a look back at how the tradition has evolved.

","         Uber driver Keith Avila picked up a passenger who looked like a    girl in a short skirt Monday night. That was the first sign that something was off, he would say later. Two women got into his car with the girl outside a house in Sacramento. Halfway to their destination  —   a Holiday Inn in Elk Grove, Calif.  —   they asked Avila to turn up the music, he said. Then the women turned to the girl. Avila listened in. “They were describing what they were going to do when they get there: ‘Check for guns. Get the money before you start touching up on the guy,’” Avila said on Facebook Live minutes after he dropped off the passengers, then called police to report the women whom he suspected of prostituting the child. The girl was 16, not 12, Elk Grove police told local news outlets. But Avila’s suspicions were right, they said. The teen was being sold for sex at the Holiday Inn, and her eavesdropping Uber driver had saved her. A    husband, father and quinceañera photographer by day, Avila had started driving for Uber just a few weeks earlier, the Daily Beast reported. Monday’s fare made him an instant celebrity.  “The police is just right there; look at that!” Avila said in the Facebook video, as blue lights flashed in his rear windshield. Outside, in the hotel parking lot, police were arresting Destiny Pettway, 25, and Maria Westley, 31, on charges of pimping and threatening a minor. “I told police, ‘If you don’t come, I’m going to go in there myself and take pictures of these guys,’ ” Avila said on Facebook. “That’s not a good life, to be under the control of another human being for the purpose of sex trafficking. ” He said he even gave police the hotel room number after overhearing the girl call her john, “probably some   pervert,” he said.  Police said they caught Disney Vang, 20, in the hotel and “determined that [he] had been involved in unlawful sexual activity with the victim. ” Vang was arrested and charged.  “What Keith did is incredible,” an Uber spokeswoman told The Washington Post in a statement. “We appreciate his quick response and professionalism in a difficult situation. ” Avila broadcast from the arrest scene for 10 minutes on Monday, until an officer beckoned him out of his car to help pick the suspected pimps out of a lineup. His video has been viewed more than 185, 000 times since then, and the    driver has become a public hero. “He could have said nothing and gone on his way and collected his fare,” Elk Grove police spokesman Christopher Trim told Fox affiliate KTXL. “And that    victim would have been victimized by who knows how many different people. ”   Alert @Uber driver contacts @ElkGrovePD, three suspects arrested on prostitution, pnadering charges #InElkGrove https:  .  pic. twitter.   —   Elk Grove News (@ElkGroveNews) December 28, 2016   The girl  —   apparently a runaway  —   was taken “to an alternative housing location,” according to the authorities. “She was reunited with her family,” Avila told the Daily Beast. “I felt kind of good about that. ”  In 2010, the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children’s president told Congress that at least 100, 000 American children, mostly runaways, were prostituted each year  —   although The Washington Post’s Fact Checker found scant evidence to support that figure. Whatever the exact number of victims, prostitution has long concerned American leaders. In a 2012 speech, President Obama said such human trafficking “ought to concern every person, because it is a debasement of our common humanity. ” “When a little girl is sold by her impoverished family  —   girls my daughters’ age  —   runs away from home, or is lured by the false promises of a better life, and then imprisoned in a brothel and tortured if she resists, that’s slavery,” Obama said. “It is barbaric, and it is evil, and it has no place in a civilized world. ” And yet, the president noted, it “also goes on right here. . . . The teenage girl, beaten, forced to walk the streets. This should not be happening in the United States of America. ” Last year, at a news conference to discuss a federal   initiative, Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch noted that “human traffickers prey on some of the most vulnerable members of our society to exploit them for labor, for sex and for servitude of all kinds. Their crimes, appropriately described as   slavery, have no place in a nation that has overcome the scourge of slavery. ” This post has been updated.

","         Crews on Friday continued to search Lake Erie after a plane carrying six people  —   who had reportedly attended an NBA game  —   vanished from radar screens early in its flight, the U. S. Coast Guard said. The Cessna Citation 525, bound for Ohio State University Airport, disappeared from radar “shortly after takeoff” late Thursday night, the Coast Guard said in a news release. The flight had departed from Burke Lakefront Airport, which is located on the shores of Lake Erie in Cleveland.    Burke Lakefront Airport. (Google Maps)  Three adults and three children were on the Cessna when went it went missing, Capt. Michael Mullen, ‎chief of response for Coast Guard District Nine, told reporters at a Friday morning news conference. Authorities were working to notify their family members. John W. Fleming told the Columbus Dispatch that his son was flying the plane, and that the group was in Cleveland for the Cavaliers  —   Celtics game. NBC News also reported that those aboard the aircraft were returning from the Cavaliers game at Quicken Loans Arena. Mullen was asked at the news conference if the passengers were in Cleveland to attend the Cavs game, and replied: “I’m not aware of that. ” Both U. S. and Canadian authorities searched Lake Erie after the flight went missing, but neither had not located any debris, according to Mullen. It was not immediately clear what caused the aircraft’s disappearance. “I’m always hopeful, whenever we’re still conducting a search out there,” Mullen said. “I truly believe that we’re out there and we’re going to find something. Having done    cases myself, as a pilot, every time I go out, I’m looking to find the needle in the haystack, and I’m hopeful that I’ll do that. So yes, we are very hopeful, and we’ll be very hopeful up until the point where we have to turn the search off and we switch over to assisting with recovery, if necessary. ” The Columbus Dispatch on Friday reported that the plane was flown by John T. Fleming, who is the chief executive of an   beverage distributor. “They think they may have crashed into Lake Erie,” his father told the Dispatch. John W. Fleming called his son “an experienced pilot. ” A statement from Joseph R. McHenry, executive vice president of the Superior Beverage Group, also confirmed that John T. Fleming, Fleming’s wife, Sue, their sons, and “two close friends” were “involved in an aircraft accident near Cleveland Thursday night. ” “While search and rescue operations are under way, we are focusing our efforts on supporting the families involved,” said the statement, posted to the company’s site. “We are working closely with the proper authorities conducting the investigation. We appreciate the efforts of the first responders on the scene. ” James Cox, a Coast Guard official in Buffalo, told the Associated Press that though the plane was housed at the Ohio State airfield, those aboard the craft didn’t have any connection to the university itself.

142567,218080,"After helping a fraction of homeowners expected, Obama’s foreclosure prevention program is finally ending",Washington Post,Renae Merle,2016-12-30,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161231004909/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/business/wp/2016/12/30/after-helping-a-fraction-of-homeowners-expected-obamas-foreclosure-prevention-program-is-finally-ending/
","     When the Obama administration announced a massive effort to help distressed homeowners in 2009,  it set high expectations. The program, government officials said, would keep up to 4 million borrowers out of foreclosure. “It will give millions of families resigned to financial ruin a chance to rebuild,” President Obama said at an event announcing the effort. “By bringing down the foreclosure rate, it will help shore up housing prices for everyone. ” Six years later, Obama is preparing to leave office and the Home Affordable Modification Program is scheduled to accept its final applications on Friday having helped a small fraction of the homeowners government officials initially expected. About 1. 6 million borrowers have seen their mortgage payments lowered through the program so far, but about a third of those people eventually fell behind on their payments again. “The president set out an ambitious goal that wasn’t met,” said Kevin Stein, deputy director of the California Reinvestment Coalition, a housing advocacy group. “It was definitely a step forward and step in the right direction, but it didn’t [reach its goal] and a lot of people ended up falling through the cracks. ” HAMP is one of the last remnants of the $700 billion taxpayer bailout effort, known as the Troubled Asset Relief Program or TARP, put in place during the financial crisis. Some of that money, about $28 billion, was carved out to help distressed homeowners by paying banks to lower their interest rates and monthly payments. It was launched in the midst of one of the deepest housing crises in U. S. history. Millions of people had taken out subprime loans that they could no longer afford, sending foreclosure rates to record levels. The Obama administration set out to save more homeowners from foreclosure, but the effort has been bedeviled by complaints that banks repeatedly lost homeowners’ paperwork or incorrectly told them that they didn’t qualify for help. The Treasury Department didn’t act quickly enough to force banks to abide by the rules of the program, housing advocates have said. Nearly 70 percent of the homeowners who applied for the program were rejected, according to government data. A 2014 report examined the record of four large mortgage servicers and found that black and Hispanic borrowers were denied entry into the program at a “significantly higher” rate. “Borrowers in substantially minority areas had at least 3 percent higher denial rates than their comparison populations of borrowers in nonsubstantially minority areas,” according to the Government Accountability Office. “Statistical differences in outcomes among population groups might suggest potential fair lending concerns that merit further examination. ” The banking industry has defended its performance, noting that some of the money it receives through HAMP is passed on to investors and borrowers, who receive incentives for paying their mortgages on time. HAMP was a complicated program, industry executives have said, and it took time to develop a protocol for judging when a borrower should qualify and how much help to give them. Many of the program’s early problems reflect its complexity, said Justin Wiseman, director of loan administration policy at the Mortgage Bankers Association, an industry group. “It’s incredibly difficult to design a program in the midst of a crisis,” he said. In the end, HAMP “did help millions of homeowners and created awareness” about the availability of loan modifications. Even critics of the program note that despite falling short of expectations HAMP forced the banking industry to change its approach toward distressed borrowers. Before the program, banks all had different approaches to helping borrowers who were behind on their mortgage payments. Some simply added a homeowners’ overdue amount to their current payments, increasing rather than lowering their payments. Others refused to discuss helping a borrower until they were 90 days delinquent. “It was really the wild, wild west,” Stein said. The government program lifted industry standards and set common expectations that banks adopted even when operating outside HAMP, said Alys Cohen, staff attorney for National Consumer Law Center. “Many homeowners got similar types of modifications directly through their mortgage company and those were modeled on the HAMP program,” Cohen said. About 1 million borrowers have HAMP loan modifications, which typically lower their payments about $500 a month. After being extended three times, the program, which was originally scheduled to expire in 2012, will stop taking applications on Friday. The program “changed how mortgage servicers handled homeowners in distress; not only by developing a template for loan modifications focused on affordability but also by creating and enforcing standards of care that have been widely adopted by the entire industry,” a Treasury spokesman said. The program was expanded over time to include helping lowering how much homeowners owed in some cases in additional to lower their payments, and people who are unemployed, a Treasury Department official noted. And another part of Obama’s foreclosure prevention effort, the Home Affordable Refinance Program, or HARP, has also been repeatedly extended as it struggled to reach as many people as initially hoped. That program allows people who owe more than their home is worth, known as being “underwater,” to refinance into a loan at a lower interest rate. So far, about 3 million homeowners have used that program. Obama administration initially expected up to 5 million. It is now scheduled to expire in September 2017. For the Office of the Special Inspector General for the Troubled Asset Relief Program, or SIGTARP, the chief watchdog of the financial   bailouts, the end of the HAMP application process doesn’t diminish its worries. Banks will continue to receive billions in incentive payments for helping borrowers who signed up for HAMP for seven years. Wells Fargo, which has received $1. 8 billion through the program, is eligible for up to $1. 5 billion in bailout funds over the next seven years, for example. JPMorgan and Bank of America, which have received $1. 9 billion and $1. 4 billion respectively, could receive about $1 billion each over the next few years. [Taxpayers are still bailing out Wall Street, eight years later] Many of these banks have repeatedly broken the rules of the program, including kicking homeowners out unfairly or making it too difficult to apply for the help, according to the agency. “While HAMP did not live up to expectations, the most important thing going forward is to protect from fraud, waste and abuse the nearly one million people with lowered interest rates in the program and the billions of dollars Treasury will continue to pay to mortgage servicers,” said Christy Goldsmith Romero, Special Inspector General for TARP."
142568,218081,"Yes, this is real: Michigan just banned banning plastic bags",Washington Post,Chelsea Harvey,2016-12-30,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161231004909/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2016/12/30/yes-this-is-real-michigan-just-banned-banning-plastic-bags/
","     This story has been updated. A new law in Michigan will prohibit local governments from banning, regulating or imposing fees on the use of plastic bags and other containers. You read that correctly: It’s not a ban on plastic bags  —   it’s a ban on banning plastic bags.   Michigan Lt. Gov. Brian Calley signed the new public act into law on Wednesday, along with 11 other bills. Gov. Rick Snyder is currently on vacation out of state, local news sources reported, and Calley has the authority to sign bills into law in his absence.   The new public act prohibits local ordinances from “regulating the use, disposition, or sale of, prohibiting or restricting, or imposing any fee, charge, or tax on certain containers,” including plastic bags, as well as cups, bottles and other forms of packaging. This means individual cities and municipalities are not allowed to ban plastic bags or charge customers a fee for using them.   Bans and restrictions on the use of plastic bags are widespread in other parts of the country and around the world. The rationale is simple: Plastic bags are infamous   sources of pollution  —   although they will eventually break down into tiny pieces, scientists believe this process can take hundreds of years, or even up to a millennium, in landfills.   Many scientists are growing particularly concerned about plastic pollution in the oceans. Research suggests that 5 million to 12 million metric tons of plastic may have been dumped into the ocean in 2010 alone. There, the waste is frequently eaten by seabirds and other marine animals  —   or it breaks down into tiny pieces known as microplastics, which scientists believe can be harmful or even toxic to sea creatures who ingest it. Bangladesh was the first country in the world to ban certain types of thin plastic bags in 2002, after they were found to have choked the nation’s drainage systems during a series of devastating floods. China instituted a similar ban in 2008, and also prohibits businesses from giving out thicker plastic bags to customers for free. Other nations, including South Africa and Italy, have also enacted similar restrictions.   San Francisco became the first U. S. municipality to institute a plastic bag ban. And in 2014, California became the first state. Many other municipalities around the country have bans or fees in place, including Austin, Seattle and Chicago, which will be repealing its citywide ban in favor of a   tax next month.   On the other hand, Michigan is not the only state to have implemented a ban on bans. Idaho, Arizona and Missouri all have enacted similar laws. In these cases, proponents of the laws have defended them as a way of protecting businesses from having to comply with additional regulations.   The new Michigan law was met with praise from the Michigan Restaurant Association for this reason. “With many of our members owning and operating locations across the state, preventing a patchwork approach of additional regulations is imperative to avoid added complexities as it related to    business operations,” said Robert O’Meara, the association’s vice president of government affairs, in a statement.   But others have criticized the legislation as an overstep in authority. Michigan news outlet MLive reported that Rep. Jeff Irwin, a democrat representing Ann Arbor, spoke out against the bill while it was still in the House, saying that it “attacks local control. ”   Earlier this year, the Washtenaw County Board of Commissioners, which is seated in Ann Arbor, had voted in favor of a new ordinance imposing a   fee on both paper and plastic bags dispensed in grocery stores throughout the county. Under the new Michigan public act, such a fee will not be permitted. Read more at Energy & Environment: He used to doubt climate change was melting this huge Greenland glacier. Not any more.

142569,218082,What happened in Washington state after voters legalized recreational marijuana,Washington Post,Christopher Ingraham,2016-12-29,2016.0,12.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161231004909/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/12/29/what-happened-in-washington-state-after-voters-legalized-recreational-weed/
","     The nation’s first recreational marijuana shop opened nearly three years ago in Colorado. Since then, a growing body of research has shown that the availability of recreational marijuana  —   in Colorado and elsewhere  —   is having little to no effect on teens’ propensity to smoke weed. That’s the conclusion, at least, of the official statistics out of Colorado through 2015. It’s what federal data shows nationwide through this year. And it’s also backed up by other federal surveys of drug use in the states where marijuana is legal. The data on this point has been consistent enough that longtime skeptics of the merits of marijuana legalization, like Nora Volkow of the National Institute on Drug Abuse, are expressing surprise at the findings. “We had predicted based on the changes in legalization, culture in the U. S. as well as decreasing perceptions among teenagers that marijuana was harmful that [accessibility and use] would go up,” Volkow told U. S. News and World Report earlier this month. “But it hasn’t gone up. ” However, a study out Tuesday in the journal JAMA Pediatrics flies somewhat in the face of the new conventional marijuana wisdom. Examining marijuana use among high school students in Washington state two years before and after the vote to legalize in 2012, it finds that rates of marijuana use increased by about 3 percent among   and   over that period.  The authors posit that reduced stigma about marijuana use is one factor leading to the results that they observed. “Our study suggests that legalization of marijuana in Washington reduced stigma and perceived risk of use,” said lead author Magdalena Cerdá of the University of California in Davis in a news release, “which could explain why younger adolescents are using more marijuana after legalization. ” The findings are something of a puzzle. The study found no change in marijuana use among   in Washington state, which the authors said could be because the   in the study were old enough that “they had already formed attitudes and beliefs related to marijuana use” before the legal change. The study also found no change in use among students at any grade level in Colorado. The authors write that Colorado had a robust medical marijuana industry in place well before full legalization, which may have affected youth attitudes and behaviors there before the study period. Here’s a summation of what they found in chart form. It compares   marijuana use rates among     and   in Washington (gray) Colorado (white) and states where recreational marijuana is illegal (dark blue).    (Cerdá et al.  Pediatrics)  Among adolescents, the perceived harmfulness of marijuana has been declining for decades among all age groups. But at the same time, adolescent use of marijuana has been flat or falling. This has led some researchers, including Mark Kleiman of New York University, to rethink the nature of the link between what teens think about weed and whether they use it. In an email, Kleiman pointed out that in Washington state, the recreational marijuana market didn’t open until halfway through 2014, and then only in limited form. That’s halfway through the “after” period (2013 to 2015) in the JAMA Pediatrics study.  “The effect of the [legalization] initiatives themselves on price and availability of cannabis really wasn’t felt until after” the study’s surveys were done, Kleiman said. “Any measured effect would be more likely the result of the political campaign around legalization than legalization itself. ” Indeed, the study’s authors agree with that assessment. “Simply legalizing an activity can change people’s views about it and can change their behaviors as well,” said   Deborah Hasin of Columbia University in an email. Still, the measured effect in the study is small  —   a 2 percent increase for   and a 4 percent increase for  . Given the small magnitude of the findings and the lack of effect among either   or students in Colorado, Kleiman said it simply “remains too early” to say anything conclusive about the effect of recreational marijuana laws on teen marijuana use. The authors of the JAMA Pediatrics study said that, given the findings, states that legalize marijuana should also invest in    programs for teens. Kleiman said there’s an even easier way to ensure that adolescent marijuana use remains at a minimum level  —   make sure marijuana doesn’t become too cheap. “There’s reason to think that adolescents are more   than adults with respect to cannabis use,” he said, “so I’d advise states that legalize to do what they can to keep prices from falling. ” More from Wonkblog: Senators held a hearing to remind you that ‘good people don’t smoke marijuana’ (yes, really) What the future of marijuana legalization could look like under President Trump Police arrest more people for marijuana use than for all violent crimes  —   combined"
